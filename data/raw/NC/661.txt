CHARLES R. GURLEY, Attorney,

Respondent

This matter was heard by the undersigned on 22 November 2017 in Wake County
Superior Court after an Order to Show Cause was served upon Charles R. Gurley
notifying him of the issue to be considered and the time and place of the hearing. Maria 1.
Brown, Deputy Counsel of the North Carolina State Bar, appeared on behalf of the North
Carolina State Bar. Gurley appeared and was represented by B. Geoffrey Hulse. Based
upon the the record, the evidence presented the hearing, the arguments of counsel, and
the relevant authority, the Court makes the following

at

FINDINGS OFF ACT.
1.
The previous findings of fact in prior orders of the Court in this matter are
incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.
Since the State Bar's receipt of notice on 2 November 2016 that a check
2.
for $50.00 was presented against insufficient funds ("NSF") in Gurley's trust account, the
State Bar has attempted to obtain from Gurley information and records regarding the NSF
and Gurley's trust account more generally.
3.
Gurley's failure to respond to the State Bar's inquiries and directives
regarding the NSF in November and December 2016 resulted in the opening of a
grievance file, 17G0002.
4.
On 2 February 2017, the State Bar sent Gurley by certified mail a Letter of
Notice in 17G0002. The Letter of Notice directed Gurley to provide, in addition to his
narrative explanation regarding the NSF, bank and trust account records relating to the
NSF.
5.
The Letter of Notice was delivered to Gurley on 6 February 2017, and
Gurley was to respond within 15 days of receipt of the Letter of Notice.

6.

Gurley did not respond to the Letter of Notice in 17G0002.

7.
On 20 March 2017, Gurley was personally served with a subpoena
commanding him to appear at the State Bar on '10 a.m. on 23 March 2017, submit to
examination, and produce the'trust account t:ecqrds relating to the NSF that Gurley had
been required to produce pursuant to the Letter pfNotice.
8.
Gurley did not appear pursuant to the subpoena. Gurley did produce via
email a limited amount of the documentation
he was required to produce.
,
'

9.
Gurley's continued failure to produce to the State Bar trust account
records and client files related to 1700002 ultimately resulted in the issuance by this
Court of a Temporary Restraining Order, Order of Preliminary Injunction, Judgment of
Contempt and Order for Arrest, and Order,Deriy,ing Motion to Stay.
'10.
On 30 March 2017, Gurley was served with Letters of Notice in grievance
file numbers 17G0084, 17G0086, and 17G0236,: ,Gurley was to respond to these Letters
of Notice within 15 days of receipt.
,

11.
Gurley has not provided a response to any of the Letters of Notice
referenced in the pridr paragraph.
~ . : ':

12.
On 7 June 2017, Gurley was serv~d with a Letter of Notice in grievance
file number 17G0541.
13.

Gurley provided an incomplete response to the Letter of Notice on 16 June

2017.
14.
On 26 June 2017, Gurley was served with a Letter of Notice in grievance
file number 17G0580. Gurley was to respond to the Letter of Notice within 15 days of
receipt.
15.

Gurley has not provided a response to the Letter of Notice in 17G0580.

16.
Gurley's failure to respond to the Letters of Notice in 17G0084, 17G0086,
17G0236, and 17G0580 and to provide a complete response to the Letter of Notice in
17G0541 resulted in the issuance of a subpoena on 6 September 2017 commanding him
to appear at the State Bar on 10 a.m. on 19 September 2017 and produce documents and
respond to examination.
17.

The subpoena was served on Gurley on 8 September 2017.

18.

Gurley failed to appear pursuant to the subpoena.
1

19.
Grievance file number 17G0580 involves allegations that Gurley
misappropriated a $50,000.00 personal injury settlement from his client C.S.

20.
The State Bar i~ in possession of evidence showing that, in February and
March 2017, Gurley and his staff told C.S. on niultiple occasions that Gurley had C.S. '8
$50,000 settlement in his trust account.
,

'

,

21.
The State Bar is in possession ofevi'dence showing that, in February and
March 2017, Gurley and!or his staff offered various reasons why the funds could not be
disbursed to C.S., including that Gurl~yneede~ pyrmission from the judge to disburse the
funds.
'
22.
The State Bar is in possession of evidence showing that, on 30 March
2017, Gurley told C.S. that he had to tum, the matter over to "the mediator" and that C.S.
could expect to hear from the mediator once he'd had an opportunity to review the case.

<I':

23.
The State Bar is in possession of evidence showing that on 21 April 2017,
Gurley represented to C.S. that he had giventhe settlement proceeds to the mediat<?r.
24.
The State Bar is in possession of eVidence showing that, since 1 January
2014, Gurley has only made one deposit into'his trust account of at least $50,000.00: a
$55,000.00 deposit made on behalf of clientrj.H. on 16 May 2016.
25.
The State Bar has not been able to find any record of any court proceeding
",
filed on behalf of C.S.
;

\'

26.
The State Bar has not been ~ple to ascertain whether any settlement check
has ever been issued on behalf of C.S.; if so~ whether the check has been negotiated; and
if so, what became of the funds.
27.
are lawful.

The State Bar's demands of information from Gurley, as described above,

28.
Gurley's refusal to provide information to the State Bar hinders its efforts
to investigate allegations' of Gurley's misconcluct and therefore to fulfill its mission of
protecting the public.
29.
In particular, Gurley's refusal to provide information to the State Bar in
17G0580 has prevented the State Bar Jrom meaningfully investigating the allegations of
serious misconduct at issue in that matter.
30.
As described above, Gurley is engaged in an ongoing pattern of
misconduct which includes knowingly disobeying obligations under the rules of a
tribunal in violation of Rule 3 .4(c), knowingly failing to respond to a lawful demand for
information from a disciplinary authority in violation of Rule 8.1 (b), and engaging in
conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8A(d).
31.
A need for prompt action exists to protect the public and the
administration of justice from continuing misconduct by Gurley, particularly where his
refusal to comply with the State Bar's lawful demands for information thwarts the
agency's ability to act for the protection of the public.
