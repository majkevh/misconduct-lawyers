,4. B'yfaHing to provide a full, fair, timely response to the letter of notice

regarding the Shaw-Chatman grievance, ignoring the State Bar's subpoena and by

:a. Nicopoulos violated multiple provisions of the Revised Rules of
:Professional Conduct.

did not personally benefit from it.

clients who have complained about Nicopoulos in the 23 years of his

all dues: and fines owed to the State Bat.
