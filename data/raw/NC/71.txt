Disciplinary

A~t'i~~:;;:

Att?rney Thomas W. Prince of
Kernl;lrsvlile was Suspended on October
15; 1979 from the practice of law in the
courts of the Appellate Division of the
North C~rolina General Court of Justice
for a penod of h"l'elve months. He was also
suspended from the practice of law in
criminal cases in the Superior. Court
Dillision and in the District Court Division
of the North Carolina General Court of
Justice for a petiod of six months. The
judicial disciplinary proceeding. which
I
was held in Superior Court, Forsyth
County, arose out of respondent's failure
to perfect the appeal in a crimjnal case in
--~~~---- which he was appointed to represent
defendent.
~I
~ Attorney Jerome Paul formerly (,
Durham; who now' resides in New Vor
.
City, was suspended from the practice (.~
law in North· Carolina for a period of two
years on.November 9.1979. A panel of the
Disciplinary Hearing Commission found
that Paul had neglected a legal matter entrusted to him by failing to seek appellate
review of a client's case, that he intentionally failed to seek the lawful objectives of
his client. that he engaged in professional
conduct that adversely reflects upon his
fitness to practice law, and that he failed to
answer a formal inquiry in a North Carolina
State Bar disciplinary matter. The suspended attorney had been retained by Gilbert
Purcell in 1976 to have Mr. Purcell's. manslaughter conviction reviewed by the N.o.rth
Carolina Supreme Court. After waIting
over a year for Paul to act, Purcell, who had
been confined in Central Prison, employed
another attorney who successfully prosecuted the appeal which resulted ina new
trial.
