to appeal the entry of this consent Order of Discipline.
Based upon the pleadings in this matter, the parties' stipulations offact, and with
the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel hereby enters the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT

l.
Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar ("State Bar"), is a body duly
organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this
proceeding under the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North
Carolina, and the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar (Chapter I of
Title 27 of the North Carolina Administrative Code).
2.
Defendant, Bradley S. Tisdale ("Tisdale"), was admitted to the North
Carolina State Bar in 2003, and is, and was at all times referred to herein, an attorney at
law licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the laws of the State of North
Carolina, the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and the Rules of
Professional Conduct.

3.
During all or part of the relevant periods referred to herein, Tisdale was
engaged in the practice of law in the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office
in Fl'anklin, Macon County, North Carolina.
4.
Defendant was properly served with process and the matter came before
the Hearing Panel with due notice to all parties.
5.

Tisdale's law practice included closing real estate transactions.

6.
From about November 2003 through January 2010,'Tisdale utilized First
Choice Closing, Inc. (FCC), owned and operated by N.F., a non-attorney, to prepare for
and to conduct real estate closings for him. Tisdale gave N.F. signatory authority for his
real estate trust account.
7.
closings.

N.F. prepared all documents for the closings and wrote the checks for the

8.
Tisdale reviewed the closing documents, reviewed the title searches,
signed all title certifications, and participated in some of the closings.
9.
Tisdale was generally not involved in the day-to-day operations pertaining
to the real estate closings or to the real estate trust account. Tisdale did sometimes
respond to specific inquiries from lenders or clients regarding their closings.
10.
Tisdale did not conduct monthly or quatterly reconciliations of his real
estate trust account.
II.
Tisdale did periodically ask N.F. for monthly bank statements and
quarterly trust account reconciliations.
12.
N.F. showed him documents purporting to be balanced monthly bank
statements and quarterly reconciliations of the trust account but Tisdale did not check the
documents for accuracy.
13.
During the time N.F. was handling Tisdale's real estate trust account, N.F.
took entrusted funds to which she was not entitled from the real estate trust account.
14.
During this time, N.F. failed to disburse entrusted client funds to the
appropriate recipients, including but not lim ited to failing to pay title insurance
premiums.
IS.
Dul'ing the time N.F. was handling the real estate t!'Ust account, the bank
deducted bank service charges, wire transfer fees, and check charges from the balance in
the real estate trust account. Tisdale did not deposit his own funds or other non-entrusted
funds into the real estate hust account to cover these deductions by the bank during that
time.

2

16.
Because Tisdale did not adequately supervise N.F., her handling of
entrusted funds, or her reconciliations of his real estate trust account, he did not know
that N.F. was not making the disbursements of entrusted funds that were shown on the
HUD-J Settlement Statements, did not know that the bank deducted bank service
charges, wire transfer fees, and check charges from the balance in the trust account, did
not know that N.F. embezzled entrusted funds from the real estate trust account, and did
not know that it was necessary for him to deposit his own funds or other non-entrusted
funds into the trust account to cover such deductions.
.
Based upon the consent ofthe parties and the foregoing stipulated Findings of
Fact, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
I.
All parties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the Panel has
jurisdiction over Defendant and the subject matter of this proceeding.
2.
Defendant's conduct, as set out in the stipulated Findings of Fact above,
constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(2) as follows:
(a)

By delegating the duties of preparing and conducting real estate
transactions and the handling of funds for the real estate transactions such
that he did not know that N.F. was not making the disbursements shown
on HUD-l Settlement Statements, did not know that the bank was
deducting fees from the entrusted funds in the account, did not know that
it was necessary for him to deposit his own or other non-entrusted funds
into the account to cover the bank fees, did not know that funds were not
being deposited into the account to cover such fees, and did not know that
N.F. was embezzling entrusted funds from the trust account, Defendant
failed to make reasonable efforts to ensure her conduct was compatible
with his professional obligations in violation of Rule 5.3(b) and failed to
properly maintain and disburse entrusted funds in violation of Rule 1.152(a) and (m); and

(b)

By delegating to N. F. the responsibility to maintain required trust
accounting records, including delegating to N.F. the responsibility to
perform monthly and quarterly reconciliations of his real estate trust
account, and by failing to adequately supervise N.F. therein, Defendant
failed to conduct the requisite monthly and quarterly reconciliations of his
trust account in violation of Rule U5-3(d).

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and with the
consent orthe parties, the Hearing Panel enters the following

3

FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
Tisdale failed to make reasonable effOlts to ensure that his nonlawyer
assistant's conduct was compatible with his professional obligations in the provision of
legal services to his clients in real estate transactions and the handling of entrusted funds
in the real estate trust account for six years.
2.
Although Tisdale occasionally spot checked a closing file, he was not
involved sufficiently in the day to day preparation for and conducting of real estate
transactions to know of, or to prevent, N.F. 's failure to properly disburse funds for
closings.
3.
Although Tisdale had established a system for reconciliations of his real
estate trust account, these measures were not adequate to ensure compliance with his
professional obligations.
4.
Tisdale's excessive delegation without adequate supervision created
circumstances that enabled N.F. to embezzle entrusted funds.
5.
Tisdale took prompt and appropriate action when he became aware of
N.F. 's misconduct.
6.
Tisdale used his own funds to reimburse clients whose entrusted funds
were embezzled by N.F. and to reimburse the trust account.
7.

Tisdale has reported N.F. to the police.

8.
Tisdale voluntarily self-reported the matter to the State Bar and has fully
cooperated with the State Bar's review of his trust account and practice.
9.
The failure to timely disburse title insurance premiums created the
potential for significant harm should a title claim arise after the expiration of the title
commitment, and potentially interfered with Tisdale's clients' goal of obtaining title
insurance.
10.

Tisdale has no prior discipline.

II.
Tisdale was admitted to the North Carolina State Bar by comity in 2003.
Previously, Tisdale had been licensed to practice law in Tennessee in 1987 and engaged
in the practice oflaw in Tennessee until he moved to North Carolina in 2003.
12.
Tisdale has indicated that he experienced personal or emotional problems
during the time period at issue.

13.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and
disbarment, in considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
Ba,ed on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, and with the consent of the parties, the Hearing
Panel makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all ofthe different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง .01l4(w)(I) of the Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and concludes the following factors warrant suspension of
Defendant's license:
(a)

Impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the
representation; and

(b)

Effect, and potential effect, of Defendant's conduct on third parties.

2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the filctors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง .OlI4(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations ofthe North Carolina State
Bar and concludes that the factors present here do not require disbarment in this case.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. I B ยง .OI14(w)(3) ofthe Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a)

Absence of dishonest or selfish motive;

(b)

Timely good faith efforts to make restitution;

(c)

Defendant engaged in mUltiple offenses;

(d)

Defendant engaged in a pattern of misconduct;

(e)

Effect of personal or emotional problems on the conduct in question;

(f)

Defendant's cooperative attitude toward the proceedings;

(g)

Defendant's remorse;

(h)

Good character and reputation; and

5

(i)

Defendant has practiced law for about 25 years.

4.
Defendant's failure to properly maintain, manage, and handle entrusted
funds betrays a vital trust clients and the public place in attorneys and the legal
profession.
5.
The Hearing Panel has considered issuing all admonition, reprimand 01'
censure but concludes that such discipline would not be sufficient discipline because of
the gravity of the potential hann to the clients. The Panel further concludes that such
discipline would fail to acknowledge the seriousness ofthe violations committed by
Defendant and send the wrong message to attorneys regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar in this State.
6.
This Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and concludes that a
stayed suspension with conditions is necessary and sufficient to adequately protect the
public.
7.
For these reasons, this Hearing Panel finds that an order imposing
discipline short ofa stayed suspension of Defendant's law license would not be
appropriate.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and the
Findings of Fact and Conclusions regarding discipline, and based upon the consent of the
