AFFIDAVIT
TO:

The Council of The North Carolina State Bar

I, Helen E. Lewis, hereby tender my license to practice and
desire to resign from The North Carolina State Bar. My resignation
is tendered freely and voluntarily, is not the result of coercion
or duress, and I am fully aware of the implications of submitting
the resignation.
I am aware that there are presently pending investigations or
other proceedings regarding allegations that I have been guilty of
misconduct, to wit, misappropriation of client funds relating to
the loan closing on February 28, 1995, between Kenneth Vendel and
Cheryl Gobble (Grievance No. 95G0349(II).
I
acknowledge that the material facts upon which the
complaints are predicated are true. I am submitting my resignation
because I know that if charges were predicated upon the misconduct
under investigation, I could not successfully defend against them.
I am aware that the N. C. State Bar Council will consider this
matter at 9:00 A.M. on Friday, April 14, 1995, and that I have the
right to be present. I hereby waive formal notice of this hearing.
