Based upon the foregoing findings of fact, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LA W
1.
All the parties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the Panel has
jurisdiction over Defendant, Phillip Hunler Gilfus, and the subject matter.
2.
That Defendant's conduct, as set forth in the findings of fact above,
constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28(b)(2) in that
Defendant violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as follows:
a. By writing checks to himself on CCDMC's bank account while serving as
treasurer of CCDMC and converting the money from those checks 10 his
personal use and benefit, Defendant committed criminal acts that reflect
adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in violation
of Rule 8.4(b);
b. By writing checks to himself on CCDMC's bank account while serving as
treasurer of CCDMC and converting the money from those checks to his
personal use and benefit, Defendant engaged in conduct involving
dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c);
c. By writing check 3054 on CCDMC's bank account to himself while
serving as treasurer ofCCDMC and attempting to convert the money from
that check to his personal use and benefit, Defendant committed a criminal
act that reflects adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a
lawyer in violation of Rule 8.4(b); and
d. By writing check 3054 on CCDMC's bank account to himself while
serving as treasurer of CCDMC and attempting to convert the money from

involving dishonesty, frand, deceit or misrepresentation in violation of
Rule 8.4{c).
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the Hearing
Panel also finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
Defendant's misappropriation was discovered in July 2012 when check
number 3054 was returned for nonsufficient funds. When that happened, a representative
ofthe bank called the president of CCDMC and reported the problem. The CCDMC
president then reported the matter to the Cumberland County Sheriffs Department and
the president was interviewed by an investigator and had (0 produce CCDMC bank
records for the investigator. The time and effort that CCDMC's president had to expend
cooperating with a criminal investigation demonstrates the negative effect of Defendant's
conduct on third parties, and actual harm to CCDMC and its members.

2.
On January 11,2013, Defendant entered into a deferred prosecution
agreement with the State. Pursuant to the deferred prosecution agreement, Defendant
was placed on supervised probation for six months and ordered to pay the costs,
remaining restitution of $35.00, and complete 24 hours of community service.
3.
The facts of Defendant's conduct and resulting criminal charge were
reported in the Fayetteville Observer in articles that appeared in the paper on December
20,2012 and January 12,2013.
4.
Defendant's decision to write ten (10) separate checks on CCDMC's
account over the course of eight (8) months to the point of overdrawing the account
demonstrates Defendant's intent to cause the resulting harm or potential harm.
5.
On January 27, 2012, Defendant repaid $604.92 to the CCDMC account
but subsequently wrote six (6) additional checks on the account. The fact that Defendant
continued write checks on the account after paying back some ofthe misappropriated
money and eventually overdrawing the account demonstrates Defendant's intent to
commit acts where harm or potential harm is foreseeable.
6.
Defendant's well-publicized acts of criminal conduct that reflect adversely
on the honesty, trustworthiness or fitness of Defendant as a lawyer has a negative impact
on the public's perception of the legal profession.
7.
On January 15,2013, Defendant reported his misconduct to the NOlth
Carolina State Bar. Defendant's report, however, came more than five months after
Defendant knew his misconduct had been discovered and after he was served with
criminal charges.
8.
Defendant testified at the hearing and candidly admitted the seriousness of
his misconduct.
9.
Defendant serves in the U.S. Army Reserves JAG Corp with the rank of
Captain. Defendant's most recent Officer Evaluation Report ("OER") which covers the
period Augnst 10, 20 I 2 through March 17, 20 I 3 found positive comments from his
evaluator and senior evaluator about his personal, legal, and military performance. On the
professionalism section of the OER, however, Defendant's evaluator checked "no" on the
attribute: "Integrity - Possess high personal moral standards, honest in word and deed."
Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Findings of Fact
Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel also enters the following:

in 27 N.C.A.C. IB § .01 14(w)(I) of the Rules and Regulations of the NOlth Carolina
State Bar and determines the following factors which support suspension or disbarment

Intent of the Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential harm is
foreseeable;

c.

Negative impact of Defendant's actions on the public's perception of the
profession;

d.

Negative effect of Defendant's conduct on third parties; and

e.

Multiple acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation and deceit.

2.
The Hearing Panel has also considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. IB § .0114(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar
ancl concludes the following factors are present in this instance that would warrant and
require the Hearing Panel to consider disbarment:
a.

b.

Misappropriation of assets to which Defendant was not entitled; and

c.

Commission of a felony.

3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. IB § .0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the NOlth Carolina State Bar
and determines the following factors are applicable in this matter:
a.

Absence of any prior disciplinary offense;

4.
The Hearing Panel has considered all lesser forms of discipline but finds
that any sanction less than disbarment would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the
offenses committed by Defendant, would not adequately protect the public, and would
send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar in this State. Defendant's misconduct caused significant harm to
CCDMC and its members, the legal profession and the public's perception of the legal
profession.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Findings of Fact
