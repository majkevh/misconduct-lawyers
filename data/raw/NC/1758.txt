a¢monition, reprimand, or'censure to the respon~ent a~torney.

A reprimand 1.S a w,ritt~n form of discipline more serious
than an ad~ortition issued in cas~sin which an attorney has,
violated one or more p'rovisions of the Rules of Professj,onal
Conduct and has caused harm or potential harm to a,client, the
administrat:ionof justice j the profession, or a 'member of the
p~blic, but, the mi.sconduct does not J;:"equire a censure.
The Grievance Corttmitt;ee was of the opinion that a censure is
not required in this case and iss1J,es this repri~and to you.
As
chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State
'Bar, it is now my d1,lty to 'issue this reprimand and I am certain
that, you wiill unders,tand £\,llly the spirit in which thi-s duty is
performed.' ,
Bobby G. Truitt and his wife hired you to handle the sale of
some real estate for them in .;January 1991. The'purchaser
defaulted, i~ mid-1991 and you undertook to represent the Truitts
in the ensu;ing foreclosure proceeding against' the purchaser.,
