CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.
All parties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the DHC has jurisdiction over
Defendant and over the subject matter of this proceeding.
2.
Defendant's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes grounds for
discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง84-28(b)(2) in that Defendant violated the Rules of Professional
Conduct as follows:
(a) By willfully failing to timely file federal and state income tax retums for the years 1997
through 2007 and 2009 through 2013, and by failing to pay federal and state income
taxes due for the years 1997 through 2007 and 2009 through 2013, Defendant
committed criminal acts that reflect adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness
as a lawyer in other respects in violation of Rule 8.4(b) and engaged in conduct
involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c);
(b) By disbursing money from his trust account for clients before depositing funds for the
benefit of those clients, thereby disbursing to or for clients funds from the trust account
to which those clients were not entitled, Defendant failed to disburse entrusted funds
only in accordance with Rule 1.15 in violation of Rule 1.15-2(a), failed to promptly
deposit entrusted funds into a trust account in violation of Rule 1.15-2(b), and failed to
promptly payor deliver to the client, or to third persons as directed by the client, any
entrusted property belonging to the client to which the client is currently entitled in
violation of Rule 1. 15-2(m);
(c) By failing to promptly remove eamed fees from the ttust account thereby commingling
his eamed fees with the entrusted funds of his clients, Defendant did not hold enttusted
property separate from the property of the lawyer in violation of Rule 1.15-2(a);

3

(d) By failing to maintain client ledger cards that con'ectly reflected funds held in trust for
his clients and for himself, Defendant did not maintain ledgers containing a record of
receipts and disbursements for each person or entity from whom and for whom funds
are received and showing the current balance of funds held in the trust account for each
such person or entity in violation of Rule 1.15-3(b)(5); and
(e) By failing to total the individual client balances and reconcile the total with the adjusted
bank statement balance for the account as a whole at least quarterly, Defendant failed to
conduct required quarterly reconciliations in violation of Rule 1.15-3(d)(I);
Based upon consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel also finds by clear, cogent and
convincing evidence the following:
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
Defendant failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for fifteen years, a
substantial period of time.
2.
Between 2004 and 2009, Defendant filed his delinquent returns and brought the federal
and state filings CUlTent up to tax year 2008. However, Defendant again failed to timely file his federal
and state tax returns for tax years 2009 through 2013.
3.
Between 2006 and 2014 Defendant did not pay any money to the IRS to apply to his
delinquent accumulated federal tax obligations despite having adequate income to make substantial
partial payments toward the debt owed to the IRS.
4.
Between 2014 and 2018 Defendant brought CUlTent his tax obligations to the N.C.
Department of Revenue.
5.
Between 2015 and 2018, Defendant made substantial payments to the IRS toward his
delinquent tax obligations. However, Defendant still owes a significant indebtedness to the IRS.
6.
While Defendant was not prosecuted for his violations of the criminal codes in federal
or state courts, his conduct nonetheless constitutes both federal and state criminal offenses.
7.
Willful failure to file a tax return is expressly identified in the State Bar's definition of
criminal offenses showing professional unfitness. This offense inherently involves a representation to
taxing authorities that one did not earn sufficient income to meet the threshold required to file a tax
return, which was not accurate in Defendant's case. Defendant's failure to file his federal income tax
returns created the foreseeable potential halm of misleading the Depattment of the Treasury in its
administration of the Internal Revenue Code regarding Defendant's income and any income tax due
from Defendant. Similarly, his failure to file his state income tax returns created the foreseeable
potential halm of misleading the N.C. Depatiment of Revenue in its administration of the N.C. State
tax code regarding Defendant's income and any income tax due from Defendant.
8.
When lawyers violate the law in their personal affairs, it brings disrepute upon the legal
profession and undetmines public confidence in lawyers.
4

9.
Defendant's failure to file returns and pay his tax obligations demonstrates not only a
disregard for the laws of this state and country but for the civic duty shared by all as a foundation of
our democracy.
10.
Keeping accurate client ledgers and conducting quatterly reconciliations are the
lynchpins of proper trust account maintenance and protection of entrusted funds. Defendant's
continued failure to properly reconcile his bust account and failure to maintain proper trust account
records demonstrates a pattern of misconduct and demonstrates Defendant's intent to commit acts in
which the potential harm is foreseeable.
11.
Defendant's conduct placed entrusted funds at risk and had the potential to cause
significant harm to the standing of the profession in the eyes of the public because it shows his
disregard for his duties as an attorney. Such erosion of public confidence in attorneys tends to sully
the reputation of, and fosters disrespect for, the profession as a whole. Confidence in the legal
profession is a building block for public trust in the entire legal system.
12.

Defendant fully cooperated with the State Bar throughout the disciplinary process.

13.

Defendant has substantial experience in the practice of law, having been licensed since

1982.
14.
Defendant has prior professional discipline. In May 1992 Defendant was censured for
inadequate preparation of a case and failing to deposit entrusted funds in a trust account. In May 1995
Defendant was reprimanded for a fee splitting arrangement.
15.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the different forms of discipline available to
it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and disbarment, in considering the
appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and with the consent of the
patties, the Hearing Panel also finds by clear, cogent and convincing evidence the following;
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code 1B .0116(f)(1) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and concludes that
the following factors are present:
(a)

Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the hatm or potential harm is foreseeable;

(b)

Negative impact of Defendant's actions on client's or public's perception of the
profession;

(c)

Circumstances reflecting Defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness or integrity;

(d)

Negative impact of Defendant's actions on the public's perception of the profession;
5

(e)

Negative impact of Defendant's actions on the administration of justice; and

(f)

Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication.

2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code 1B .0116(f)(2) and concludes that the while the factor of acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, or
fabrication is present, it does not wan-ant disbarment in this instance.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code. 1B .0116(f)(3) and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a)

Prior disciplinary offenses in this state or any other jurisdiction;

(b)

Remoteness of prior offenses;

(c)

Dishonest or selfish motive;

(d)

A pattem of misconduct;

(e)

Multiple offenses;

(f)

Full and free disclosure to the hearing panel or cooperative attitude toward the
proceedings; and

(g)

Degree of experience in the practice of law having practiced since 1982.

4.

Defendant should be taxed with the administrative fees and costs of this action.

5.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser altematives and fmds that a public censure,
reprimand, or admonition would not be sufficient discipline because of the gravity of the potential
harm to Defendant's clients, and the potential significant harm Defendant's conduct caused to the
public, the administration of justice, and the legal profession.
5.
The Hearing Panel has considered all lesser sanctions and finds that discipline short of
suspension would not adequately protect the public, the profession and the administration of justice for
the following reasons:
(a)

The factors under Rule.0116(f) that are established by the evidence in this case are of a
nature that support imposition of suspension as the appropriate discipline;

(b)

Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to acknowledge the
seriousness of the offenses Defendant committed and would send the wrong message to
attomeys and to the public regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar of
this state; and

6

(c)

Protection of the public requires that Defendant not be pennitted to resume the practice
of law unless and until he demonstrates that he understand his obligations as a citizen
and an attomey.

6. Defendant's conduct, if continued or tolerated by the Bar, poses significant potential hann to
the profession.

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Findings and Conclusions
Regarding Discipline, and with consent of the patties, the Hearing Panel enters the following
