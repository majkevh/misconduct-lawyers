PUBLIC CENSURE

This Public Censure is delivered to you pursuant to section
23 of Article IX of the Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar as ordered by a hearing committee of the
Disciplinary Hearing Commission following a hearing in the above
captioned proceeding on May 25, 1990. At that hearing, the
hearing committee found that you have violated various ~rovisions
of the ~ules of Professional Conduct of the North Carol~na State
Bar.
In January of 1988, you agreed.to represent Eq,9ar C. Ruof in
Ruof's effor't;:sto obtain 1?arole. RUQf's father pa~d you $750 to
represent Ruof. You rece~ved the $750 check on January 25, 1988.
YOl,l understood that Ruof became eligible for parole in June of
1989.

Ruof indicated that he wanted you to assist him in getting
parole by getting into the Mutual Ag·reement Parole Program
(MAPP). During the course of your representation of Ruof from
January 1988 to. June 1988, you did not talk with anyone with the
North Carolina Parol.e Commission about the MAPP. program, neither
did you speak with q.:nyone about Ruof's pos'sibility of being
paroled.

I

In your first letter dated, January 12, 1.988 to Ruof, you
informed him that you could help hilJl... . You also told him that
"although much. o.f 0Uir work can be done by m'ail, I always make it
a policy to meet with my client in person."
Approximately two months passed and Ruof heard nothing from
In your letter of March 8, 1988, you informed Ruo·f that you
h~d be9un work on h~s case and that you needed to get together
w~th h~m soon.
You told Rubt that you would come and visit him
within the next few days.
you.

During the entire time of your representation, ~ou never
visited Ruof to dis'cuss his case while he was in pr~sono
Furthermore, durin9the course of your representation of Ruof,
you conutmnicated Wl. th him twice by your January 12, and ~arch 8,
1988 letters.
.
Ruof discharged you as his attorney sometime in June of 1988.

He asked that you return his fi~e and refund any p~rt O? the fee
that you had not earned. You d1d not return the f1le promptly to
Ruof and you did not refund a.ny of the ul1e'arned attorneY'1;3 fee
until. after Ruof filed a, grievance against you with the N,ort;h
Carolina state Bar.
You inclicated that during the time Y9u represented'Ruof, you
had a heavy case load and were involved 1n other mor~ serio\:ls .
legal matters. The hearing committee believed that ¥9~~ case
load and othe;- p+,iorities were no excuse for your faJ..~l.lretogive
proper attent10n to Ruof's ca,se. In fact, tne comm¢nt to R\:lle 6
of the Rules of professionalCc:;mduct proVides that "g, ;tg,Wyer's
,
work load should be controlled s,o that each matter can he handled.
adequately. " When a lawyer ca,nnot give proper atteritio'nto' a
'
client's legal matter, the lawyer should inform the cl.ient so
that he may decide to retain other counsel.
Your fa.ilure to take effective action on Ruof's behalf and
your failure to adequately com;municate with him" were. vloiations
o~.Rule 6-(B) (1.) c;1nd (3) of the Rules of Professionalc,brlduC;:.t • .
The hearing committee hoted that your ne~l-ect in handl~ng~uof/s
case could have resulted" in potential inJUry to your client.

1

You also failed to res1?ond prom1?tly to the North Caro'lina
state Bar's Grievance Comm1ttee in 1ts investi~ation of the
grievance filed l;>y Ruof. against you. You :r;ece1ved al:.etter o.f
.
Notice from the state Bar relative to Ruof's grievance .on Ja~nua:r:y,
27, 1989. You did not res1?onq "to tpe Letter of Notice within.
.
fift'een days of receiving 1t~ 'N'ei"tper d:i.d you rec:;rues,t'sn
extension of time to respond to the Letter bfNot10e. :sven aft$r
the North Carolina state Bar sent follow-up letters toyOl,l ort
March 28 and April 27, 1989, r$minding ¥ou of you:r;- obl,~gation to
respqnd to the' Letter of Notice, you fa11.ed to answer the
grievance. The North Carolina state Bar .issued a subpoena d1.:lces
tecum to you on May .16, 1989' requiring yoq to testify ,in the
grievance investigation regarding your rep+,esentation q~ Ru,of.
~ou received the subpoena and cOll'llf\unicatec;l your receipt, o'~ it .by
letter dated May 22, :1,.989 t·o Mr. l? E. James. On May 'l'5, IQa,9,
you sent a response. to the Letter of Notice and it was received
by the state Bar on May 16, 1989. Therefore, yo.u wel;e excuseq
from the subpoena on May 30, 1989 since you had filed a response •
..

The bar counsel assigned to the ~rievance filed ag~inst you
sought additional information regard1ng the gr:i,evanc~'by letters
dated June 6 and July 5, 1989. Wl1en you fc;1iled to re$'pond ,
1?romptly to bar c:;:ounsel' s letters., the North Carolina sta·te S'q.;r!'
1ssued a subpoena duces' tecum to you on July 19, 1989. You
finally responded to bar counsel's additional questiQns. by a
letter dated August 10, 1989 and you enclosed al,l .Q.09umen"ts in
your file regarding Ruof's case.

.1

Your failure to respond to the North Carolina stat~ Bar's
formal inquiries in a prompt and expeditious man~er v~91at.e~ N. .
C. Gen. stat. section 84..,.28 (b) p) and Rule 1. ;L(B} of -ene Rules o·~
Professional Conduct. The dilatory manner in whi.ch ¥ou resp.onded,
to the North. Carolina state Bar is very serious and iLnexcusable.
As a . licensed attorney in North Carolina,. you have an gbligc;1tiQn
to respond to the North Carolina state Bar's investigation of
grievances filed against you. The North Carolina state Bar can
carry out its function of discipline and regulation 9~memb~rs of

the Bar when attorneys cooperate by giving full, fair, and prompt
responses to the _St-at;e Bar's inquiries. If ¥ou should ever
receive another in~ir¥ from the North Carol.~na state Bar, you
should respond to ~tw~th dispatch.
The hearing committee, after hearing all the evidence and
character witnesses on your behalf., imposes this Public Censure.
The fact that the hearing committee has chosen to impose the
sanction of Public Censure should not be taken by you to indicate
that the Disciplinary Hearing Commis$ion in any way feels that
your conc:iuct in this :matter was excusable or not serious. The
hearing committee is satisfied that you will never again allow
yo~rself to dep~rt from the strict adherence to the highest
standards of the leg~l.profession.
Signed by the Undersigned chairman with the full knowledge
and c;:~~ent of the other~~
lJ\bers of the hearingcQmmittee, this
the _..'1 day of
