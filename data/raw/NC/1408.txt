justice, engaged in professional conduct that adversely reflec,ts
on your fitness to practice law, concealed and knowingly fa~led
to disclose that'which you were required to reveal, and knowingly
, made a false ,statemen~ of fact in violation of Disciplinary Rules
1...:.102(A)(4), (5), and (6), and 7-102(A)(3) and (5) of the Nor'th
Carolina Code of profes~ional Responsibility.

I

Your conduct tow:ard the Court and the Grievance Commi t tee
was most unprofessional. It violated not only the· letter, but
also the spirit of the Code of Professional Responsibility.
It
brought discredit upop you and tends to place the Courts and the
ear in disrepute.
'
Honesty is expec~ed ot every lawyer. Truth and, integrity
are the cornerstones of our profession. A lawyer who cannot be
trus ted, whose word cannot be re 1 ied upon, is o,f 1 i t tle use to
~is clients and the Cpurt.
By seeking to aeceive the Court and
the Grievance ~ommittee concernihg your status as.an attorney
dependent upon th~State for compen~ation, you display~d a casual
disregard for the truth and a willingness to place consideration
of your fee above you;t:' reputation and your- responsibi'lity as an
officar of the Court. Such an additude is intolerable and is
entirely inconsistentlwith our profession's traditional
subordination of private gain to public service.
It should also be mentioned that your failure to truthfu,lly
respond to the inqUiries of the Griev'ahce Coromi ttee dishonored
another great traditi6n of the Bar, that, of self-reg~lation. The
pro-fession is privileged to regulate its own members because it
is deemed best able to formulate, interpret, and enforce high
standards of ethics. iWheh you attempted to deceive the Grievance
Commi ttee you compromised the effectiveness o'f the Bar's
investigati~~ prodedu±es and the principie of self~regulation.
I

_

The Hearing Committee was hot insensitive to certain
mitigating factors in:your-case. Although restitution can never
excuse such tranegres$ions, it can ameliorate the conseqUences.
The fa:ct ,that you hav$ reimbursed both the State and the Mills
family is some testimony to your present good faith. More
significant were your own personal expres~ions of r~morse and
regret and your admis~ion of the facts alleged against you.
These _manifes.tatione <pf your presen,t s,tate of mind, ,in
combination with the tact that you have practiced for 10 years
without having previo~sli run atoul of the Code of Professiopal'
Responsibility, have ~onvinced the Disciplinary Hearing
Commi$sion that suspension of your law license is no't 'necessary
to protect the public~s interest.
The North Carolina State Bar is confident that this Public
Censure will be heeded by you, that it will be remembered by you,
and that it will be beneficial to you. We are confident that you
will never again allo~ yourself to depart from strict adherence
to the highest standards of the legal profession. Accordingly,
We sincerely trust that this Public Censure, instead of being a

Pursuant to Section 23 of the Rules of Disci.pli'nary
