Earlv 111. Tlie North Carolina State Bar was reoresented bv Carolin Bakewell. The
Defendant, Kurt A. Elusanl, was represented by Wilder Wadford. Based upon the
admissions of the defendant in his Answer to the complaint, the stipulations on
preheating conference and the evidence presented at the hearing, the hearing committee
finds the following to be supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence:
FINDINGS OF FACT
1. The Plaintiff, the Nort11 Carolina State Sar, is a body duly organized under the

licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the rules, regulations and Rules of
Professional Collduct of the North Carolina State Bar and the laws of the State of N o d l
Carolina.
3 During all of the periods referred to herein, the Defendant, I h t A. Ehrsam
(hereafter, Elrsam), was actively engaged in the practice of law in the State of North

Carolina and inaintained a law office in the Town of Brevard, Transylvania County,
North Carolina.
4. Prior to Aug. 7, 1995, Elusam undertook to serve as the closing attorney for
the sale of real property by Cline Anders (hereafter Anders) to Robert Stewart (hereafter
Stewart).
5. On or about Aug. 7, 1995, Elusan received $121,813.41 on Stewart's behalf
relative to the real estate closing. On the same date these funds were deposited into
Elusam's attorney tmst account, assigned account number 1952608220 at First Citizens
Bank (hereafter attorney trust account).
6. Between Aug. 8 and Nov. 28, 1995, Ehrsam disbursed all but $1,3 15.42 of the
closing proceeds as directed.
7. The $1,3 15.42 which Ehrsam was holding relative to the Stewart-Anders
closing should have been disbursed to pay title insurance, real estate taxes and other
items. Contrary to his instructions, however, Elusam failed to disburse these funds
properly.
8. Elusall misappropriated a portion of the $1,3 15.42 in remaining proceeds from
the Stewart-Anders closing for his own use and benefit, without the permission of Anders
or Stewart.
9. Prior to Aug. 11, 1995, Erhsan undertook to serve as the closing attorney for
the sale of real estate by Harold Paxton (hereafter, Paxton) to Cline Anders.
10. On Aug. 11, 1995, Elusam received a total of $100,862.46 relative to the
Paxton-Anders real estate closing. On the sane date, Erhsam deposited the $100,862.46
into his attorney trust account.
11. Elusam disbursed all but $1,299.60 from the Paxton-Anders closing funds
between Aug. 11 and Aug. 29, 1995. Elusan1 was entitled to a $400 fee relative to the
Paxton-Anders closing, but did not withdraw the fee from lus attorney tmst account.
12. The reinaining $899.60 in Paxton-Anders proceeds should have been
disbursed to pay the real estate taxes, title insurance policy and other items.
13. Ehrsanl failed to pro~nptlydisburse the reinaining funds as directed.
14. The balance in Elusam's attonley trust account dropped to $1,304.71 on Feb.
7, 1996. On and after Feb. 29, 1996, when the N.C. State Bar obtained an order freezing
the trust account, the balance in the account has remained at $1,154.50. That sum is
insufficient to pay all of the claims relative to the Anders-Stewart and the Paxton-Anders
closings.

15. Prior to Aug. 31, 1995, Ehrsam undertook to serve as the closing attorney for
the sale of real estate by Robinson and Marge Jacques (hereafter, the Jacques) to Wanda
Shockley (hereafter, Shockley).
16. At the time of the Aug. 31,1995 closing, the Jacques' property was subject to
a prior mortgage held by Centura Bank, in the amount of $28,558.93.
17. On approxin~atelyAug. 31, 1995, Ehrsam received $44,855.08 on the
Jacques' behalf. He was directed to deliver $28,558.93 of the closing proceeds to
Centura Bank to pay off the prior mortgage on the Jacques property.
19. Ehrsam failed to deliver the $28,558.93 to Centura Bank until Feb. 1, 1996,
despite demands by the Jacques that he do so.
20. Elusam did not have permission to use the Jacques funds for his benefit or the
benefit of third parties other than the Jacques.
21. At all times between Aug. 3 1,1995 and Feb. 1,1996, Ehrsam should have
maintained at least $28,558.93 in his attorney trust account for the benefit of the Jacques.
22. The balance in Elusam's attorney trust account dropped below $28,558.93 on
a number of occasions between Aug. 3 1, 1995 and Feb. 1,1996.
23. Ehsanl misappropriated all or a portion of the funds which he should have
held for the Jacques for his own benefit or that of third parties, without the Jacques'
knowledge or consent.
24. Mr. and MIS. Jacques received notices from Centura Bank in November
1995, indicating that their prior loan had not been paid off. When they asked Ehrsam
about the matter, he falsely told them that the payoff check had been mailed to the bank
and that the matter was talten care of..
25. As part of his duties regarding the Jacques-Shockley closing, Elusam was to
draft a note and purchase inoney deed of trust for the Jacques.
26. Ehrsam did not record and deliver the note and purchase money deed of trust
to the Jacques until Jan. 28, 1996.
27. The N.C. State Bar failed to prove by clear, cogent and convincing evidence
that Ehrsam failed to respond to the letter of notice concerning the Jacques' grievance
within the time permitted by the Discipline & Disbarment Rules of the N.C. State Bar.
Based upon the foregoing FINDINGS OF FACT, the hearing committee hereby
enters the following:

Jacques and Stewart without their consent, Ehrsam committed criminal acts that reflect

misrepresentation in violation of Rule 1.2(c).

the benefit of the Jacques, Paxton, Stewart and Anders as directed by his clients, Ehrsam
violated Rule 10.2(e).

off, Ehrsam engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation

deed relating to the Jacques' closing, Elusanl neglected a client matter in violation of
