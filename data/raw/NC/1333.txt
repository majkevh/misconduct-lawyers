During or prior to the time that the misrepresentations occurred"

the Pefendant,

~li1J,iam

Zuckennan, was serving as chainnan of the Ethics

and Grievance Cartmittee of his local Bar.

In that capacity, the Defendant,

William Zuckerman, :should have knowh his responsibilities and duties to his
client, his client ':sout-of-state counsel and to the State Bar.
17.

The

~fendant,

William Zuckerman, was slow to cooperate with

the State Bar's investigation
in this matter prior to it being presented
I
to the Grievance Ccmt!ittee, but he did cooperate prior to ernployrre.nt of

independant cOUl'ls;ell to represent him in this matter.

and

When Defehdant, William. Zuckennan, did cooperate he made a full

frankdisclosur~

the following:
'CONCLtJSIQ.\1S, ,~. LAW

Pursuant to Section 23 of the Rules 0;1: Discipline qnd Disbar.ment of
the North Carolina State ,Bar, ,t'his·!'ublic Cen$Ure is d~liverE;d to you.

You

have been found to have violated the, Code of Pro:fiessiona,l' :Respons~ility ,
of the North Carolina State Bar by a Hearing ,Canunittee Of the . Discip1inaJ:¥
~aring

Camni.$sion sitting on August 29, 1980.

The fact that this Public Censure i;s not the

~st

serious Of ,pOssible.

discipline provided for in North Carolina General Statute ,84-28 should not
be taken by you to indicc;tte that the

No~

Carolina Stg:l:e BCU;iri ap,y

~¥

feels that your conduct in this matter was excusable or was conRidered, by
the members of the Hearing Ccmnittee of the DisciplinarY Hea;ring cOm;ni.ssion

to

I

be any less than a very serious ,and substantial vi01c;ttion

,of the Code' of .

Professional Responsibility.
In 1976, you ,agreed to represent Mr. Hurray Michael in pursuing an

alleged malpractice claim agaj,nst Mr. Michael's fonner ?tttomeys.
subsequently informed Mr. Michael, either directly or

through:

You

his Floripa

counsel, David Kerben, that the malpractice acti0n h?i¢l. 'been ftl.l~~· On

,

-2-

irore than one occas,ton, you informed ].tr. Michael or

M;r.

Kerben that the Case

was close to settlement or settled.
Despite ali reIi'resentations to r,tr. Michael and Mr. Kerben that the
I

malpractice action Was either filed, close to settlement or settled, you

J

never filed the malJfractice action nor entered into negotiations for

I

the settle.rrent of sc;rme.
i

Although no prejudice resulted to Mr. Michael as a result of your

I

actions, you misrepresented to Mr. Michael and to his Florida counsel,
Mr. Kerben, the status of Mr. Michael is case.

This conduct is a direct violation of the COde of Prof(3ssional Responsibility and in addition is a reflection on you and the entire Bar of this
State.

Your cbnduct was unprofessional.

It violated not only the lette:!;',

but. also the spirit of the Code of Professional Responsibility of the
North carolina State Bar.

It was not such conduct as is expected of a

netlber of the legal profession.
I

It brings discredit upon you and tends to

plaGe the courts of; this State and your fellow ft1embers of the Bar in disrepute and further damages both in the eY(3s of the public.
FaiJ;.ure of att¢meys to conduct the!tlselves within the law and Within
the bounds of the

C~e

of Professional Responsibility is the most serious

complaint against oliIt profession, and your misrepresentations to Y0tjr
client as to the status of his case was your error here.

You placed a

privilege that you hold as a lawyer to serve the public in seriQUs jeopardy.
The North Caroiina State Bar is confident that this Public Censure

will be heeded by yc;>u, that it will be r~ed by you, and that it will
be beneficial -to you.

We are confident that you will never again allow

yourself to depart fran strict adherence to the highest standards of the
legal profession.

~ccordingly,

we sincerely trust that this Public Censure,

instead of being a burden, will actually serve as a profitable reminder to
weigh carefully yow;- responsibility to the pubiic, your clients, your
fellow attorneys,

~

the court, with the reSlilt that you will be known

as a respected rnerab$:" of our

p;rof~ssion

whose word aDd conduct may be

relied upon without question.
Pursuant to SeCtion 23 of the Rules of Disciplinary procedure, it is
,
