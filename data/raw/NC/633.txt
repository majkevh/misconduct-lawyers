NCSB v. Goard, 18 DHC 11

Consent Order of Discipline
Page 5 of13

2.
Goard's conduct, as set forth in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes grounds for
discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(2) in that Defendant violated the Rules of
Professional Conduct as follows:
(a)

By assisting Newton with the drafting of an affidavit for Kudlate to be used
by Newton in his efforts to recover damages for his injuries, and by
communicating with Kudlate about an affidavit including discussing
revisions she asked to be made, all while his license to practice law in North
Carolina was suspended, Defendant engaged in the unauthorized practice of
law in violation of Rule 5.5(a);

(b)

By failing to timely respond to Thompson's requests for a progress report
about Thompson's case, Defendant failed to keep Thompson reasonably
informed about the status of the matter, and failed to promptly comply with
reasonable requests for information in violation.ofRule 1.4(a)(3) and (4);

(c)

By failing to timely communicate with Thompson or to take any action in
pursuit of Thompson's claim between July 2014 and March 2015, Defendant
failed to act with reasonable diligence in violation of Rule 1.3;

(d)

By telling Thompson the bar did not have any insurance, Defendant made a
misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c);

(e)

By stating in his response to the grievance inquiry that the bar went out of
business, Defendant made a misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(e);

(f)

By his conviction ofDWI in State v. James M. Goard, 09CRS2915 (Gaston
County), and his conviction ofDWI in State v. James M. Goard, 15CR53743
(Rowan County), and his commission ofDWI at the time of the February 6,
2016 collision, Defendant committed criminal acts that reflect adversely on
Defendant's fitness as a lawyer in violation of Rule 8.4(b).

3.
Goard's conduct.. as set forth in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes grounds for
discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(3) in that:

Defendant made a knowing misrepresentation of facts surrounding a charge

Additional Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline
1.

The findings of fact in paragraphs 1 - 58 above are reincorporated as if set forth

herein.

2.
Defendant's conduct caused significant harm to the profession and the public's
perception of the profession as Defendant's repeated acts of driving while impaired over an
extended period are documented in court files of his criminal cases and some were the subject of
media reports. The public expects that attorneys will abide by the law and Defendant's conduct
shows his disregard for his obligation to obey the laws of this State.

3.
Defendant's 1-85 DWI. taking place after he had been convicted of DWI in two
prior cases, involved a collision with another vehicle and Defendant fleeing from the scene to
avoid detection for his unlawful conduct.
4.
Defendant was on probation for a prior DWI conviction at the time he committed
the 1-85 DWI.

5. Defendant's past chronic substance ab1,.lse problem resulted in neglect of
Thompson's legal matter and denied Thompson the level of professional services he reasonably
expected when he agreed to hire Defendant as his attorney.
6.
Defendant's misrepresentations the State Bar during the grievance process
demonstrates Defendant's failure to participate in the self-regulation process which causes
significant harm to the profession and the public's perception of the profession.
Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel also enters the following:
Conclusions With Respect To Discipline

I.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of discipline
available to it. In doing so, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C. Admin. Code IB .0116(f)(1) and concludes that the following factors are present:
(a)
Intent of the defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential hmm is
foreseeable;
(b)
or integrity;

circumstances reflecting the defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness,

(c)
negative impact of the defendant's actions on client's or public' perception
of the profession;
(d)

effect of Defendant's conduct on third parties; and

(e)

acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication.

Consent Order of Discipline
Page 7 of13

2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code 1B .01 16(f)(2) and concludes that the following factor is present but does not warrant
disbannent in this case given the totality of the circumstances:
(a)

Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication.

3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in '27 N.C. Admin.
Code. IB .0116(f)(3) and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a)

Dishonest or selfish motive;

(b)

prior discipline for criminal contempt in 01 CVD8298 (Mecklenburg

County);
(c)

a pattern of misconduct;

(d)

multiple offenses;

(e)

effect of any personal or emotional problems on the conduct in questions;

(f)

effect of any personal or emotional disability or impail1nent on the conduct
in question;

(g)

submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices
during the disciplinary process;

(h)

degree of experience in the practice of law; and

(i)
interim rehabilitation: since February 9, 2016, Defendant has been attending
AAlNAJCA meetings on a daily basis; all dmg testing of Defendant by the N.C.
Depattment of Public Safety since that date has been negative.
4.
Defendant's conduct caused significant harm to the legal profession in that his
actions brought the legal profession into disrepute.

5.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser altematives and finds that a censure,
reprimand or admonition would be insufficient discipline becallse of the haml and potential
significant haon to Defendant's clients and the significant harm to the legal profession caused by
Defendant's conduct.
6.
The Hearing Panel finds that discipline short of suspension would not adequately
protect the public, would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the misconduct and would send
the wrong message to attomeys and the public about the conduct expected of members of the Bar
of this State.

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Findings of Fact Regarding
Discipline and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel hereby enters the
