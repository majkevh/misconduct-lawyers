42. After being summoned to Farmer's office, Washburn 'called Pitts to discuss the
Waymire matter.
43. Pitts told Washburn that the clerk's office's Was responsible for paying the
delinquent medical expenses.
44. Washburn reminded Pitts that the money for the medical providers had been paid to
Williams and Pitts, and not to the clerk's office.
45. At the conference with Farme~ on June 6, 1996, with Washburn present, Pitts falsely
advised Farmer that the subrogation lien and most of the medical providers had been paid. Pitts
did not continue to contend that the clerk's office was responsible for paying Waymire's medical
expenses.

I

46. At the time Pitts made the repiesentation that the subrogatioh lien creditor and most
_ of the medical providers had been paid, Pitts knew th~t she had no factual basis for making that

creditor or any of Waymire's medical providers, and had no basis for believing that anyone else
had.

Citizen's Bank in the sum of$15,000.OO. :Pitts did not indicate 00 the check what the check was
for. On the checkbook stub for check 3022, Pitts indicated that the check was payable to her as
fees. Pitts did not indicate which clients' fees Were being paid by check number 3022 on the
checkbook stub.
48. Pitts used the proceeds of check number 3022 to purchase a cashier's check payable
to Marc Bagwell and his attorney, Williani Little. Pitts had settled a malpractice claim with
Bagwell and Little by agreeing to pay $15,000.00 up front and an additional $1,000.00 a month
for fifteen months.

49. In her trust account records, Pitts charged $10,000.00 of check number 3022 to the
Waymire ledger and the remaining $5,000.00 to the ledger of a client named Mishue.
:

50. At the time Pitts attributed the $15,000.00 removed from her trust account as fees
due her from Waymire and Mishue, Pitts knew that she had already received her fees from each
of those clients.
'
51. By \\riting check number 3022' from her trust account to First Citizens Bank for her
personal use when she had no fees remaining in the trust account for Waymire or Mishue, Pitts
appropriated funds held in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of other clients to her own use without
their knowledge or consent.
