On October 5 & 6, 2006, this matter came on to be heard before a hearing conunittee of
the Disciplinary Hearing Commission composed ofF. Lane Williamson, Chair; T. Richard Kane,
and H. Dale Almond. A. Root Eclrnonson and William N. Farrell, Jr. represented the North
Carolina State Bar and Alan M. Schneider, Dudley A. Witt, and David B. Freedman represented
James B. Ethridge. Based upon the admissions in the Answer, the stipulations of fact in the PreHearing Ord~r, and the evidence presented at the hearing, the hearing committee fmds that the
following h3$ been established by clear, cogent and convincing evidence:
FINDINGS OF FACT

1.
:Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar, is a body duly organized undet the laws of
North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this proceeding under the authority granted it in
Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, and the rule~ and regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar promulgated thereunder.

2.

pefendant, James B. Ethridge, (hereinafter "Ethridge"), Was admitted to the North
Carolina State Bar on August 19, 1973, and is, and was at all times referred to herein, an attorney
at law licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the rules, regulations and Revised Rules
of Professional Conduct of the State of North Carolina State Bar and the laws of the State of
North Carol~a

I

3.
puring the times relevant herein, Ethridge actively engaged in the practice of law in
the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office in Smithfield, Johnston County, North
Carolina until; he became a District Court Judge in 2004.
4.
On August 16, 2001, Ms. Rosalind W. Sweet (hereinafter "Ms. Sweet") met with
Ethridge in his law office to obtain his assistance in safeguarding her property from her own
relatives and others. Although Ethridge had met Ms. Sweet in his partner's office in 1974,
Ethridge hadri.ot had any contact with Ms. Sweet between 1974 and August 16,2001.

I

5.
At the time of this meeting, Ms. Sweet was 69 years old and was being encouraged·
by Wendy Whitfield ("Wlritfield") in Adult Pr()tective Services at Johnston County Social
Services to agree to placement in an assisted living facility due to her inability to care for herself
_ .
caused by dementia.
6.
On. AUgUSt 16, 2001, Ethridge prepateda deed conveying 'Ms. Sweet's residence,
described as lot number 11 Old Mill property, to himself.

I

7.
On August 17, 2001, Ethridge took the deed he had prepared to Ms. Sweet's
residence where Ms. Sweet. signed it ip her bedro()m and it Was then notarized by Lyndon D. '
McKennie, a friend of Ethridge.
8.
Ethridge then drove Ms. Sweet to the State Employees' Credit tJnio~,where they
both entered and Ms. Sweet withdrew $14,249.11 from her account to purchase a money.order
made payable to her.

9.
Ethridge and Ms. SWeet then went to the Four Oaks Bank across from Ethridge's
office where Ms. Sweet endorsed the money order for $14,249.11 from the State 'Employee$'
Credit Union. The proceeds from the Il10ney order were then used to set up a personal checking
acco\iflt in Ethridge's name with him as
sole signatory, account nilmber ending 706 ("account
No. 706"). Ethridge was instructed by the representative of Four Oaks Bank to endorse the
money order. Account No. 706 was not set up as a trust or fiduciary account and did not indicate.
that Ms. Sweet had any interest in the account.

the

10. Thereafter on AUgUst 17, 2001, Ethridge recorded the deed transferring Ms.
Sweet's real property to himself in the Register of Deed's Office of Johnston County.

I

11. Ethridge attached $24 in revenue stamps to the deed that falsely represented on the
public record that he had given $12,000 to Ms. Sweet in consicjeration for the property. Etbrldge
mistakenly believed that the amount of revenue stamps reflected $48,000 in consideration for the .
property.
12.

On August 28, 2001, Ms. Sweet Was placed in a family care home.

13.

On September 10,2001, Whitfield left a message with Ethrid~e to return her call.

14.

On September 12,2001, Ethridge visited Ms. Sweet at the family care facility..

15. On September 12, 2001, Ethridge returned Whitfield's call and Whitfield told
Ethridge that Ms. Sweet was transferred to the family care facility because she was D.o.t able to
take care of herself. Whitfield asked Ethridge why Ms. Sweet's real property was d~eded to him
and he advised her that Ms. Sweet decided to do this because she owed him for past legal..
services.

16. On September 20, 2001, Ethridge withdrew $750.00 from account No. 706 by
check number 526 payable to cash.
17.' Ethridge testified that he gave Ms. Sweet $350 of the cash from check number 526
when he visited her at the family care home, that he used $75 of the money to get the grass cut at

Ms. Sweet's home, and that he intended to use the remainder of the cash for her benefit such as
to buy hOIIi~owner's insurance covering her house. However, the other evidence presented at the
hearing showed that Ethridge only visited Ms. Sweet at the family care home on one occasion September '12, 2001. Ethridge could not have given Ms. Sweet $350 of the cash from check
·number 526 eight days prior to writing the check.

I

On September 24,2001, Ethridge wrote a check payable to the Four Oaks Bank in
the amount :of $13,499.1 I from account No. 706 to place Ms. Sweet's funds in a trust account.
However, Ethridge reco~sidered this and instead opened a separate personal checking account at
the Four oaks Bank in his name with him as the sole signatory, account number ending 606
(hereinafter ,"account No. 606"), With the deposit of the check for $13,499.11 drawn on accolint
No. 706. Account No. 606 was not a trust or fiduciary account and d~d not indicate that Ms.
Sweet had any interest in the accoUilt.
18.

19. ,On or about September 24, 2001, Ethridge gave $1,500 of his personal funds ,in
cash to Broderick Parrott ("Parrott"), a contractor, as a partial deppsit for Parrott to put siding,
windows and doors on the house Ms. Sweet had deeded to Ethridge.
20. ,On September 28,2001, Ethridge gave Parrott another $1,500 of his personal_funds
in cash as additional deposit for the siding, windows and doors 'and Parrot gave Ethridge a receipt

On October 2,2001, a petition was filed by thomas S. Berkau (Berkau) on behalf
of Ms. Sweet's nephew, Roosevelt Williams, Jr. ("Williams"), to have Ms. Sweet adjudicated as

On October 18, 2001, Ms. SWeet was adjudicated as incompetent and it was
ordered that a, guardian be appointed for Ms. Sweet.

I

1;;1...0

25. On October 18, 2001, Williams was appointed as general guardian for Ms., Sweet
by the Johnston County Clerk of Superior Court, Will R. Crocker.
26. On or before October 30, 2001, after undertaking an investigation of Ms. Sweet's
assets, Berkau left a message for Ethridge indicating he wanted to talk with Ethridge about Ms.
Sweet.

I

27. On October 30,2001 Ethridge went to Berkau's offic~.Berkau told Ethridge that
he was the .attorney for the general guardian that had been ,appointed for Ms. Sweet. Ethridge
"acknowledged to Berkau that Ms. Sweet had conveyed her real property to him and that she had
wi$drawn money from the credit union. Ethridge told Berkau that he had givenMs, Sweet
$7,000 of the money withdrawn from the credit union 'account ahd that he held the remainder of
Ms. Sweet's money. Ethridge agreed to return Ms. Sweet's property. Berkau told Ethridge that
he would send Williams to get the money from Ethridge.
28.

Ethridge reconveyed the real property to Ms. Sweet on October 31, 2001.

m

29. Also on October 31, 2001, Ethridge wrote a check made payable to cash
the
amount of $8,000~00 from account No. 606 that he deposited into his trust account, account
number ending 230.
30. On November 16, 2001, WilliamS went to ethridge's office to get Ms. Sweet's
money from Ethridge. Ethridge wrote a check in the amount of $8,000.00 from his trust account
number 230 and gave it to Williams who delivered it to Berkau.
31. On December 21, 2001, Ethridge wrote a check in the amount of$SQO.OO payable
to cash from account No. 606.
32. , Because Williams had not found any cash at Ms. Sweet's house, Wil1i~s advi$ed
Ethridge, on one or more occasions, that Ethridge had not returned all of Ms. Sweet's money.

I

33. Prior to January 2,2002, Parrott returned the $3,000 he had received from Ethridge
by paying $3-,000 to Ethridge in $100 bills.
34. On January 2, 200l, Williams went to Ethridge's office demanding that Ethridg~
return, the remainder of Ms. Sweet's money. Ethridge wrote a check, frQm a personal accoltilt
ending in number 364, in the amount of $4,000.00 to 'Williams 8$ guardian-ad-litem (sic] for Ms.
Sweet. Ethridge hand wrote a release that he had Williams sign that "releases and discharges
James B. Ethridge from all claims, damages or money that maybe [sic] owed to Rosalind
Williams Sweet arising out of a disputed amount of mont~y that was given to James B. Ethridge
to hold for her." Williams signed the release and received the check.
35. By requiring Williams to sign the release, after having told Williams' lawYer,
Berkau, that he had given Ms. Sweet $7,000 in cash when the $14,249.11 was removed from her
credit union account, Ethridge held out that the amount that he should have to return· was in
dispute. By requiring Williams to sign a release releasing him from any other claim ofmoney he

~./

may owe to Ms. SWeet, Ethridge held 01Jt that he did not owe Ms. Sweet any further funds. Thus,
Ethridge failed to account for the $2,249.11 of Ms. Sweet's funds that he had not returned.
36. On January 17, 2001, Ethridge wrote a check in the amount of $85.00 payable to
cash from riccount No. 606.
37.' After writing a check for the $4,000 payment to Williams from his personal
,account, on' February 4, '2002, Ethridge wrote a check to 'himself in the amount of$3,700.00 from
account No. 606 and on the Same day deposited this check into his personal bank account,
account number ending 364.

I

38. Between February 2002 and August 2003, monthly service charges were removed
from account No. 606 by four Oaks Bank.
39. • On August 11,2003, Ethridge closed his personal bank account No. 606 which he
had opened,with a deposit of Ms. Sweet's funds by wiflldrawing the balance in the amount of
$243.01.
40. ' Although Ethridge testified that he held $2,250 for Ms. SWeet in cash in an
envelope frqm January 2; 2002 until he delivered it to Berkau on September 21 2006 because
Ms. Sweet had not wanted Williams to have it, Ethridge did not have the option to choose to
retain any of Ms. Sweet's money after he knew that the Clerk of Superior Court had appointed a
guardian fori her that was responsible for her property.
j

41. . When he was served with notice of the grievance that led to this matter on August
4, 2005, Ethridg~ told State Bar Investigator Steven M. Annis: "I paid back all of the money I
received from her" and "I don't have the money to pay, but I can borrow the money ,if I have to
pay any back." Those statements are inconsistent with Ethridge's testimony that he had $2,250
in cash in an envelope for Ms. Sweet.
42. ; Ethridge failed to account for Of return to Ms. Sweet .or her guardian $2,249.11 of
Ms. Sweet's funds until after service of the Letter of Notice in this matter in August 2005.

I' "
"

43.
The deposit of Ms. Sweet's funds into a personal account in Ethridge's name as
sole signatory, and the preparation and recotding of a deed to Ms. Sweet's real property to
, himself with' revenue stamp~ thereto falsely reflecting that Ethridge bad paid consideration for
the property ~end to show that Ethridge had an intent at the time of the initial transfers on August
17, 2001 to ,misappropriate Ms. Sweet'.s funds and real property that had been entrusted to
Ethridge in ~ fiduciary capacity as an attorney to his own use and ownership. The prompt
reconveyance of the real property by Ethridge when notified of the appointment of a general
guardian for Ms. Sweet nevertheless tends to negate the existence of such intent as of th~ time of
the initial trat)Sfers under the clear, cogent and convincing evidentiary standard applicable to this
proceeding. The hearing committee therefore finds that the allegations in the compl~nt that
Ethridge inteaded to misappropriate Ms. Sweet's real property and funds at the time of the initial
transfers have not been proven to the applicable standard.

I

44. Ethridge's handl'ing of Ms. Sweet's funds subsequent to the initial transfer of
AUgUSt 17, 2001, and his own conflicting explanations relating to the handling of the funds,
however, compel the heanng committee to find. that he had an intent to misappropriate and did in
fact misapprop-riate funcJs of Ms. Sweet py the time he, wrote checks from entrusted funds to
himself and others and took cash from the account containiIlg Ms. Sweet's entrusted funds. .
BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact, the hearing committee makes the
following:

I

BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the evidence
presented at the heating and the arguments of counsel, the hearing committee hereby makes the
following:

FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. Ethridge; s misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
(a)

A dishonest or selfish motive; and

(b)

Substantial experience in the practice of law.

2. Ethridge's misconduct is mitigated by the following factors:
(a)

Absence of a prior disciplinary record;

(b)

Good character and reputation; and

(c)

Delay in the disciplinary proceedings not attributable to him.

I

3. The hearing committee has a great appreciation of the facts showing. that Ethridge has
come from a poor background, has Jed an exemplary life, and has been a pillar· in his community,
but because pfEthridge's dishonesty, the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
Disbarment is the only sanction that can adequately protect the public for the
following reasons:
(a)

I

An attorney's duty to preserve a client's entrusted ft,mds is one of the most
fundamental duties that an attorney undertakes. An attorney should never violate
that duty or the trust the client has in the attorney to honor that duty.

(b)

By misappropriating Ms. Sweees entrusted funds, Ethridge violated that duty and
his clients' trust. In doing so, Ethridge caused significant harm to his client.

(c)

Ethridge's violation of his duty to preserve his clients' entrusted funds caused
significant harm to the legal profession.

(d)

Entry of an order imposing lesser discipline would fail to acknowledge· the
seriousness of the offen~es that Ethridge committed and would send the wrong
, message to attol'Q.eys and the public regarding the conduct expected of members of
the Bar in this State.

(e)

The ptotection of the public requires that Ethridge not be permitted to resume the
practice of law until he demonstrates that he has reformed, that he understands his

I·

I
..
..

obligations to his clients and that reinstatement would not injure the standing of
the legal profession. Disbarred attorneys must show reform~tion, ~ong other
things, before they resume the practice of law, whereas no such showing of'
reformation is required of an attorney whose license is merely suspended for a
term certain.
BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact Regarding DiscipliI\eam;i the arguments of
counsel, the hearing committee hereby enters the following:

I

ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

1. The Defendant, James B. Ethridge, is hereby disbarred.
2. Ethridge shall surrender his license and membership card to the Secretary within 30
days of the effective date of this order.
3. The costs of this proceeding ~e taxed to Ethridge and shall be'paidas assessed by the
Secretary with 90 days of the entry date of this order.
Signed by the Chait with the consent of the other members of the hearing cOI\11llittee this .
