7.
On September 29, 1993, the Defendant sent a certified letter to the minor child's father,
Gregory Scott Cowgur (hereafter, "Mr. Cowgur"), requesting him to consent to the adoption of his
minor child by Mr. Newsome and enclosing an adoption form.
8.
The certifi~d letter to Mr. Cowgur was signed as received on, October 7, 1993 by Fern
Borum at the address where Mr. Cowgur apparently lived. However, Mr. Cowgur neftherretUined the
consent form nor contacted the Defendant about the proposed adoption.

I

,

9.
The Defendant took no further action on the adoption until Mrs. Newsome contacted the
Defendant in early 1994. At that time, the Defendant prepared a petition to terminate Mr. Cowgur's
'
parental rights (hereafter, the "Petition'').
10.

Mrs. Newsome signed a verification page attached to the Petition on February 23, 1994.

11.
The Defendant signed the Petition as attorney for the Petitioner, Mrs. Newsome, on
August 16, 1994.
12.
Carolina.

The Defendant never filed the Petition in the District Court, Davie County, North

;

13.
The Defendant wrote a district court file number at the top right-hand side of the
pleading caption in order to make it appear that the Petition had been filed.
14.
In August 1994, the be~endant prepared and signed a Notice Of Service Of Process By
Publication (hereafter, the "Notice") addressed to Mr. Cowgur and advising that a pleading seeking
relief in the nature of termination of his parental rights had been filed against him and, that 4e was
required to respond within a certain period of time.
15.
Carolina.

The Defendant never filed the Notice in the District Court, Davie County, North

1

16.
the Defendant wrote a district court file number at fue top right-hand side of fue
pleading caption in order to make it appear that the Notice had been filed.
17.

The Defendant never submitted the Notice for publication in the newspaper.

18.
Thereafter, Mrs. Newsome called the Defendant concerning the status of the proceeding
to terminate Mr. Cowgur's parental rights and the adoption.
At all relevant times, the Defendant led Mrs. Newsome to believe that the adoption was
19.
proceeding and would be completed.
20.
Some time in 1995, Mr. Newsome came to the Defendant's office seeking
documentation showing that the adoption of the minor child had been finalized.

21.
At that time in response to Mr. Newsome's demand, the Defendant materially altered a
final adoption order entered in another case so that the final adoption order would appear to effectuate
the adoption of the minor child by Mr. Newsome.
22.
Specifically, the Defendant deleted the names of the real parties from a true and
accurate adoption decree entered.in another case and inserted the names of Mr. Newsome and the
minor child. She also inserted fictitious dates.
23.
The Final Order For Adoption, as altered by the Defendant, purported to bestow upon
Mr. Newsome and the minor child the relationship of parent and child, with all the right~,
responsibilities and duties of that parental relationship.
24.
The Final Order For Adoption, as altert:d by the Defendant, also purported to change the
minor child's stimame from "Cowgur'; to ','Newsome" and directed the State Registrar of Vital
Statistics to issue a new birth certific~te recording this name change.

I

25.
The Defendant delivered to Mr. Newsome a copy of the Final Order for Adoption, as
altered by the Defendant.
26.
Mr. and Mrs. Newsome later discovered that the Final Order for Adoption delivered to
Mr. Newsome by the Defen4ant was not an authentic order of the court and,in fact, that an adoption
proceeding relating to the minor child had ever been instituted, much less finalized.
27.
The adoption of the minor child by Mr. Newsome has been finalized with the assistance
of a new attorney.
28.
The Defendant has not reimbursed Mr. and Mrs. Newsome for attorney's fees paid to
the Defendant by Mrs. Newsome in the amount of$150.00.
Bilsed upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and the stipulations contained in the Stipulations on
Prehearing Conference filed by the parties, the Hearing Committee enters the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

I

1. All parties are properly before the Hearing Committee and the Committee has jurisdiction
over the defendant, Jennifer Brock, and the subject matter.
2.' The Defendant's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, cQnstitutes grounds for
discipline pw:suant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28(b)(2) as follows:

matter and by failing to promptly and accurately respond to all requests for information, the

(c) By failing to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing Mrs. Newsome,
the Defendant neglected a legal matter entrusted to her in violation of Rule 6(b)(3) of the
Rules of Professional Conduct;

Conduct.
(e) By intentionally failing to carry out a contract of employment entered into with Mrs.

Professional Conduct;

1

(f) By materially altering the Final Adoption Order and delivering the altered document to Mr.

Newsome meanwhile representing that it was an authentic order of the District Court of
Davie County, North Carolina, the Defendant:
(1) engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in 'violation
of Rule 1.2(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct; and
• I

(2) engaged in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of
Rule 1.2(d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and upon the evidence and
arguments of the parties concerning the appropriate discipline, the Hearing Committee hereby m~es
additional
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1. The Defendant's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:

1

•
•
•
•
•

record of prior discipline
pattern of misconduct, including similar misconduct for which the Defendant
has already been disciplined
