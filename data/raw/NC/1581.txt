Ms. Pearce's real property with ,a lease-back ag.tee,ment a,nd a,

The 'March 7 of 8, 1988 arrangements were beneficial to Florq
Pearce and were not unfair to her at that tirne.HCMeve:r;, if
tpose contracts weJ;ebreached, a potential for unfa.trn~to
Flora Pearce then did exist.

The Defendant and Tom Collins had an a~t that ~y
would distribute, the proceeds r~ived from the property
transactions with Flora Pearce as follows: each woUld be
repaid his initial ;investinent, plus fees ~ ~.. .

for Tom ColI~ to make that purchase. That ,fact resulted ..
in the breaCh 9f the March 7 or 8,1988 arrangements.

As a r~t of that breach of contract, what had previously
