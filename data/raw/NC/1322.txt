From February 1, 1972, and during the periods of time pertinent to

this proceeding, the Defendant Edwards was a duly licensed attorney engaged
in the practice of ia,.;, and employed by the professional association chartered
under the name of Edwards and Warren Professional Association, and maintained
his office in the Ci;ty of Charlotte, MeCklenburg County, North Carolina..
8.

Edwards and Warren Professi<;mal Association perfonned various legal

services for one Nr. Kenneth Noore Murphy in 1972, in 1973, and in 1974, on
,

January 14, of which latter year, various aspects of a cattle feeding operation
of one WallaceG. McKinney t/a r-1cKitmey Cattle Company fram the Mid\vest,
were discussed with the said Mr. l-furphy and his accountant by the Defendant
tJI.ark Edwards, along with one
9.

~I.

Gresham NorthcOtt.

At no time auring this meeting, or thereafter, did the Defendant

Edwards suggest to the said !.'lr. Murphy that he should invest in the McKinney
Cattle Company entity, although the Defendant E&vards did state that he
invested in it and felt it to be sound.
10.

Following this meeting, the Defendant Edwards agreed with the said

Mr. Northcbtttm.i3.t

the latter would pay Edwards and Warren Professional

Association monies t9 be applied toward i;he legal fees contemplated to be
incurred by the said Mr. Mu:tphy and other clients of Ec..1wards and Warren
Professional Association uran their investment for

~ch

things as seeing to

,

the proper treatment of the investments on tax returns., questions regarding
i

..

~

....3Mr. Murphy's investments, to the knowledge of the Defend~t Edwa;~'ds but

without disclosure to the said
13.

~1r.

Murphy.

The Defendant Edwards analogized this rrethOd of the payment: of le9'al

fees 'to that of a purchaser of a corwratiQn paying legal

I

by the selling corporation, which is an acceptable

p~actice,

this arrangement was beneficial to their client, the said
wise, the latter woulCl. have had to pay addi tiona! iega':L
