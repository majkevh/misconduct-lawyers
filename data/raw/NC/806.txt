had been met and Counsel for the North Carolina State Bar did not file a response
objecting to Kelmon's petition for reinstatement.

BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Secretary makes the
following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.
Pursuant to Rule .0125(b)(5), if the Counsel does not file a response to the
petition before the petitioner is first eligible for reinstatement, then the Secretary will
issue an order of reinstatement.

2.
Since the Counsel has not filed a response, it is appropriate for the
undersigned to issue an order of reinstatement.
3.
Based upon the date of the expiration of his suspension and the date of his
filing of his Petition for Reinstatement, Kennon is eligible to be reinstated on August 12,
2013.
THEREFORE, pursuant to Rule .0125 of the North Carolina State Bar Discipline
