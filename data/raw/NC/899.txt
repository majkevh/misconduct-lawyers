THIS MATIER was heard on July 8, 2011 before a hearing panel of the
Disciplinary Hearing Commission composed of Sharon B. Alexander, Chair, Fred
M. Morelock, and Patti Head pursuant to 27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง.0114 of the Rules and
Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar. Defendant, Perry W. Martin, was
represented by Lloyd C. Smith, Jr. and Lloyd Clifton Smith, III. Plaintiff was
represented by Deputy Counsel Margaret Cloutier.
Based upon the record and the evidence introduced at the hearing, the
hearing panel finds by clear, cogent and convincing evidence the following
FINDINGS OF FACT
1. Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar (hereinafter "State Bar"), is a
body duly organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to
bring this proceeding under the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General
Statutes of North Carolina and the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina
State Bar promulgated thereunder.
2. Defendant, Perry W. Martin (hereinafter "Martin" or "Defendant"), was
admitted to the North Carolina State Bar on August 5, 1950 and is, and was at all
times referred to herein, an Attorney at Law licensed to practice in North
Carolina, subject to the rules, regulations, and Rules of Professional Conduct of
the North Carolina State Bar and the laws of the State of North Carolina.
3. Defendant was properly served with process and the matter came
before the hearing panel with due notice to all parties.

4. During the times relevant herein, Defendant actively engaged in the
practice of law in the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office in
Ahoskie, Hertford County, North Carolina.
5. Defendant was retained to represent DeAnna Dodway in a matter
relating to divorce and property distribution.
6. Defendant represented Ms. Dodway from approximately November
2008 until October 2009.
7. In or about January 2009, Defendant met with Ms. Dodway in his office
to consult about the case. When Ms. Dodway got up to leave, Defendant moved
toward her and placed his hands on either side of her against the wall preventing
her from moving freely. Defendant then tried to kiss Ms. Dodway on the lips.
When she protested and moved away Defendant told Ms. Dodway she was too
beautiful not to kiss.
8. In or about April 2009, Defendant again met with Ms. Dodway in his
office to consult about the case. During that meeting, Defendant asked Ms.
Dodway whether she believed he was too old to have a personal relationship
with her. When Ms. Dodway said yes, Defendant told Ms. Dodway that when he
used his tongue on her during oral sex she would holler and make all kinds of
noise. Defendant asked Ms. Dodway how much each button on her blazer would
cost to unbutton. Defendant then came around behind Ms. Dodway where she
was seated and tried to kiss her on the neck before she moved away.
9. In or about April 2009, Defendant and Ms. Dodway were in the
courthouse hallway after Ms. Dodway had been granted a divorce from bed and
board. In response to her inquiry about the implication of the court's decision,
Defendant told Ms. Dodway she was now free to have sex with anyone she
wanted to, including Defendant.
10. During the representation, Defendant contacted Ms. Dodway by
telephone and requested that Ms. Dodway allow him to come to her residence for
dinner and that she do so at a time when her children would be visiting with their
father and she would be alone. Defendant did not specify that the meeting would
be to discuss Ms. Dodway's legal matters. Ms. Dodway understood Defendant to
be asking to come to her home and engage in sexual relations.
11. In or about September 2009, Defendant and Ms. Dodway attended a
mediation scheduled in her legal matter. In Ms. Dodway's vehicle in the parking
lot after the mediation, Defendant asked if Ms. Dodway were willing to work out
payment for his services. When Ms. Dodway pointed out that Defendant's
services were paid in full in advance of the representation, Defendant said that
was not the kind of payment he was referring to. Defendant told Ms. Dodway he
knew of a motel on 1-95, that the people who ran it were discreet, and that no one

2

would find out. Ms. Dodway understood Defendant to be asking her to go to the
hotel and engage in sexual relations.
12. On October 19, 2009, Defendant again met with Ms. Dodway in his
office for a consultation regarding her case. Because of Defendant's prior
statements and conduct, Ms. Dodway felt that it was necessary to tape record
this meeting. During that conversation Defendant asked Ms. Dodway if she
wanted to drive Defendant back to the hotel where she was staying. When Ms.
Dodway asked what he would expect, Defendant responded, "If I went to
Roanoke Rapids to spend the night with you at the motel? I would expect us to
explore everything in the world sexually tonight that we could think of ... "
13. When Ms. Dodway was leaving the meeting of October 19, 2009,
Defendant tried to hug and kiss Ms. Dodway.
14. Defendant admitted making the statements set out in paragraph 12
above which were tape recorded by Ms. Dodway. Defendant acknowledged that
he "might have" said something similar to the statement attributed to him as set
out in paragraph 9 above. Defendant denied making any of the other statements
attributed to him as set out in paragraphs 7, 8, 10 and 11. The panel did not find
Defendant's testimony in this regard to be credible.
15. After considering all of the evidence and testimony of all of the
witnesses, the panel finds the testimony of Ms. Dodway to be credible.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the hearing panel enters the
following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. All parties are properly before the Disciplinary Hearing Commission
and the Disciplinary Hearing Commission has jurisdiction over Defendant, Perry
W. Martin, and the subject matter of this proceeding.
2. Defendant's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above,
constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C.G.S. ยง84-28(b)(2) in that
Defendant violated the Rules of Professional Conduct in effect at the time of the
conduct as follows:
By making sexually explicit comments to Dodway, attempting to touch her
in a sexual manner, and attempting to convince her to have sex with him,
Defendant attempted to have sex with his client which constitutes an attempted
violation of Rule 1.19(a) in violation of Rule 8.4(a) and engaged in conduct
prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d).

3

Based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, the hearing panel also
finds by clear, cogent and convincing evidence the following
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. Ms. Dodway borrowed from a close family member the funds
necessary to engage Defendant's services at the outset of the representation.
That same family member initially suggested Ms. Dodway consult with
defendant. Ms. Dodway felt embarrassed to tell anyone about the advances
Defendant was making toward her and felt that no one would believe her. For
these reasons, Ms. Dodway did not immediately tell anyone about Defendant's
actions.
2. Ms. Dodway terminated Defendant's services after the October 19,
2009 meeting with Defendant. Ms. Dodway hired another attorney who was able
to resolve her remaining legal matters promptly.
3. Ms. Dodway stated that, because of her experiences with a male
attorney, should she be in need of legal services in the future she will only
consider engaging a female attorney.
4. During the grievance process Defendant submitted a written response
to the Letter of Notice and written responses to follow-up inquiries of State Bar
counsel. During this DHC proceeding Defendant filed an Answer and testified in
a deposition. These written and testimonial responses were inconsistent with
Defendant's testimony at the hearing in this matter and contained statements or
allegations for which Defendant had no factual basis.
5. Defendant was disciplined by Admonition for dissimilar conduct in
1989. The prior discipline issued to Defendant was so remote in time as to have
no bearing on the discipline in this matter.
6. Defendant's conduct demonstrated that he put his own personal
interests and desires before the legal interests of his client. He showed no
remorse during these proceedings and did not acknowledge that his course of
conduct during his representation of Ms. Dodway was improper.
7. Defendant presented several witnesses whose testimony
demonstrated that Defendant enjoys a good reputation within the community.
8. Defendant's conduct toward Ms. Dodway was purposeful and was of a
nature that it would be obvious to Defendant that the conduct was exploilive of
his client's trust and reliance upon him and from which a conflict of interest would
inherently arise.

4

Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional
Findings Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel also enters the following
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. The hearing panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. 1B ยง.0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina
State Bar and determines that the following factors are applicable in this matter:
a. Defendant's selfish motive;
b. Defendant's cooperative attitude toward the proceedings;
c. Defendant's submission of false evidence, false statements or other
deceptive practices during the disciplinary process;
d. Defendant's refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct;
e. Defendant's lack of remorse;
f. Defendant's reputation for good character within the community;
g. The vulnerability of the victim, Defendant's client; and
h. Repeated instances of conduct that violated the Rules of Professional
Conduct involving the same victim.
2. The hearing panel has also considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง.0114(w)(1) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina
State Bar and determines that the following factors are applicable in this matter:
a. The intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential
harm was foreseeable;
b. Defendant's elevation of his own interest above that of the client; and
c. The negative impact of Defendant's actions on the client's perception of
the profession.
3. The hearing panel has considered the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. 1B ยง.0114(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina
State Bar and determines that none of the factors are established by the
evidence in this case. The panel therefore does not consider disbarment to be
necessary to protect the public in this case.

5

4. The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. An admonition, reprimand, or censure would not be
sufficient discipline because of the gravity ofthe potential harm Defendant's
conduct caused to the public, the administration of justice, and the legal
profession.
5. The panel determines that discipline short of suspension would not
adequately protect the public, the legal profession or the administration of justice
for the following reasons:
a. The factors under Rule .0114(w)(1) that are established by the
evidence in this case are of a nature that support imposition of a suspension as
the appropriate discipline; and
b. Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offense Defendant committed and would
send the wrong message to attorneys and to the public regarding the conduct
expected of members of the Bar of this state.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and
Findings and Conclusions Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel enters the
following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1. The license to practice law in the State of North Carolina of Defendant
Perry W. Martin is hereby suspended for three years from the date this Order of
Discipline is served upon him.
2. The period of suspension is stayed for three years as long as
