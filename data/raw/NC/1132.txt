final account within twenty (20) days.
7.
On or about February 5, 2008 the Assistant Clerk of Court found that
Shelton had willfully failed and refused to file the final account as previously ordered by

8.
Shelton was ordered to personally appear before the Clerk of Court on

representative of the Estate and attached for contempt for failure to comply with the
Order of the Court.

of Court.

Shelton was removed as personal representative of the Estate by the Clerk

12.
During the time he was the personal representative of the Estate, Shelton
conducted the closing for the sale of a business, the Broad Street Bar and Grill, on or
about January 26,2007.
13.
Shelton prepared two settlement statements for the transaction. The initial
statement with a closing date of January 26, 2007 showed the following:
Contl'act Price:

$90,000.00

Attorney Fees for Buyer:

$975.00

Attorney Fees for Seller:

$975.00

14.
This closing statement was signed by Phil Peterson on behalf of the buyer
and by Shelton on behalf of the seller, the Estate of Mark Allen Westbrook.
15.
Shelton failed to disburse the funds from the sale of the business to the
Estate until June 5, 2008, subsequent to being removed as the personal representative of
the Estate.

16.
In June 2008, Shelton prepared a second and different settlement
statement for the sale of the business which he had earlier closed on January 26,2007.
17.
The two settlement statements are different in the amounts charged the
buyer and seller for certain costs.
18.

document preparation in the amount of $1,950.00, which had not been charged to the

attomey fees charged to the Buyer during the January 26,2007 closing.

part, as follows:

also my fee for the remaining work which I had done on behalf of the
estate (will probate, dealing with creditors, etc.)."

Estate from the Clerk of Superior Court as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. 28A-23-4.

himself which did not identify the client.

and received the proceeds from the sale of the business, Defendant allowed the balance in
his tlUst account to fall below the minimum amount he should have been holding for the

disbursements associated with the sale of the business, described in paragraph 12 above,
were misappropriated or missing while Defendant served as personal representative of
the Estate.

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the Hearing
Panel also enters the following
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.

Defendant has substantial experience in tile practice oflaw.

2.

Defendant has no prior discipline.

3.
Defendant has reimbursed the Estate for legal fees he collected from the
Estate which had not been submitted to tile Clerk of Court for approval.
4.
Defendant has completed the Foster closing and has obtained tile title
insurance policy.
5.
Defendant's failure to respond to multiple inquiries from tile State Bar,
including requests in wliting and by subpoena, demonstrates a refusal to participate in
tile self-regulatory process. Such conduct interferes with the Bar's ability to regulate its
members and undennines tile profession's privilege to remain self-regulating.
6.
Defendant's conduct has caused hann and potential siguificant harm to his
clients, the public, and the legal profession. Defendant's failure to abide by the Clerk of

COUli's Orders and being held in contempt have the potential to cause significant hann to
the legal profession in the eyes of the public because these actions show a disregard for
his duties as an attorney and an officer of the cOUli. Erosion of public confidence in
attomeys foster disrespect for the profession as a whole.
7.
Defendant's failure to maintain proper trust account records in accordance
with the Rules of Professional Conduct has the potential to harm future clients and the
public.
8.
Defendant's failure to maintain appropriate trust accoUllt records in
compliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct does not allow tills Panel to reach any
conclusion at this time concerning whether Defendant has maintained all trust funds in
his trust account in full compliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct.
Accordingly, the State bar is not prohibited j}-om investigating and pursuing further
disciplinary action against Defendant, if necessary, based upon the results ofthe audit as
set fOrtil in the Order of Discipline to follow below.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional
Findings Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel also enters the following
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B Â§ .OI14(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of tile Nortll
Carolina State Bar and finds the following factors are applicable in this matter:
a.

Defendant's lack of prior disciplinary offenses;

b.

Defendant's timely good faith effOlis to make restitution or to rectify
consequences of misconduct;

c.

Defendant's mnltiple offenses;

d.

Defendant's pattern of misconduct; and

e.

Defendant's s substantial experience in the practice oflaw.

TIle Heating Panel has also considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. 1B Â§ .OI14(w)(I) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State BatÂ·
and finds the following factor warrants suspension of Defendant's license:
?

3.

Elevation of the Defendant's own interest above that of the client;

4.
Negative impact of the Defendant's actions on client's or public's
perception of the profession;

5.
justice; and

Negative impact of the Defendant's actions on the administration of

6.
Multiple instances offailure to participate in the legal profession's selfregulation process.
7.
Any sanction less than an active suspension of Defendant's license would
fail to acknowledge the seliousness of the offenses cOlmIIitted by Defendant, would not
adequately protect the public, and would send the wrong message to attomeys and the
public regarding the conduct expected by members of the Bar.
8.
Due to the Defendant's neglect of his obligations to the profession, the
adminish'ation of justice, his clients, and his refusal to pmiicipate in the self-regulating
process of the NOlih Carolina State Bar, the Heming Panel concludes that the public and
the profession will only be adequately protected by imposing a period of active
suspension of DefendmIt' s law license. The Healing Pmrel has considered an admonition,
replimmrd or censure but concludes that such discipline would not be sufficient to protect
the public and profession.
9.
Defendant should be allowed the opportunity to apply for a stay of a
poriion of the active suspension imposed by this Order upon compliance with certain
conditions designed to ensure protection of the public and to ensure DefendmIt's
complimlce with the Rules of Professional Conduct.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Findings and
Conclusions Regarding Discipline, and upon consent of the parties, the Healing Panel
enters the following
