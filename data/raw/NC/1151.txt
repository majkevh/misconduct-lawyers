Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the Hearing Panel
hereby finds by clear, cogent and convincing evidence the following additional
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.

The findings of fact in paragraphs 1 - 93 above are reincorporated as if set forth

2.

Defendant put his own personal interests ahead of his clients' interests.

herein.

3.
Defendant's misappropriations occurred at times of demonstrated personal
financial need.
4.
Defendant put false information in the memo lines of the checks by which he
misappl"Opriated entrusted funds to disguise the misappropriation.
5.
Defendant made false statements about the payments by which he
misappropriated entrusted funds during the disciplinary process, both at his deposition and at the
hearing.
6.
Defendant's conduct involved misappropriation, misrepresentation and deceit
over a period of years.
7.
Defendant, by engaging in conduct involving misappropriation, misrepresentation
and deceit over a number of years and by making false statements about his conduct, has shown
himself to be untrustworthy.
8.
Defendant, through his misappl"Opriation, misrepresentation, and deceit, has
caused harm to the standing of the legal profession, by undermining trust and confidence in
lawyers and the legal system.
9.
Defendant's misappropriation has caused significant harm to his clients and to
third parties, namely the medical providers of his clients.
10.
Defendant misappropriated funds for his own benefit that should have been used
for the benefit of his clients, either by payment to the client or payment to the client's medical
provider(s).

-11-

II.
Defendant's misappropnatlOns of Miller-Billips' funds resulted in Defendant
having insufficient funds to pay outstanding medical bills for Miller-Billips. Consequently,
Defendant's subsequent disbursements to medical providers for Miller-Billips utilized other
clients' entrusted funds in his trust account.
12.
The State Bar examined trust account records of Simmons for the period of
January 1, 2010 through April 30, 2012. There was no activity in the account after April 16,

for clients exceeded the amount of money Simmons had in his trust account. This is an
additional significant harm to clients caused by Simmons' misconduct.
13.
Simmons paid $700.00 to Fonville. Simmons wrote this check on February 8,
2013, 3 days after being notified bye-mail that the State Bar intended to notice and take
Fonville's deposition. Simmons did not make any restitution to Fonville in the intervening year
and a half after he misappropriated Fonville's funds or in the intervening 3 months after the State
Bar alleged he misappropriated Fonville's entrusted funds in its complaint. Simmons made his
payment to Fonville immediately after learning the State Bar would take Fonville's deposition.
Under these circumstances, Simmons' payment to Fonville does not constitute a timely good
faith effort to make restitution. Simmons has not otherwise made any restitution for amounts
misappropriated from clients. Simmons has not rectified the deficit in his hust account.
14.
Defendant has prior discipline in the form of a stayed suspension imposed by the
DHC in 1994. Even though the prior conduct is remote, the finding in the 1994 disciplinary
order concerning Defendant's presentation of false or misleading or deceptive evidence is
relevant to this disciplinary hearing.
15.
Defendant has failed to acknowledge that he misappropriated client funds.
Defendant has provided explanations that are not consistent with the evidence received at the
hearing in this matter.
16.

Defendant has engaged in significant pro bono work in the course of his practice.

17.
Defendant has established a reputation for good character, veracity, and
truthfulness in social and legal communities.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
The Hearing Panel carefully considered all of the different forms of discipline
available to it.
2.
The Hearing Panel considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB
§ .01l4(w)(I), (2) and (3) of the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar and concluded that the
following factors are applicable:

-12-

27 N.C.A.C. IB § .01l4(w)(l)
a.

Factor (B), Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm
harm is foreseeable;

b.

Factor (C), Circumstances reflecting Defendant's lack of honesty,
trustworthiness, 01' integrity, in the testimony presented at the hearing and
in the deposition evidence that conflicted with the credible evidence
received by the Panel during the hearing;

c.

Factor (D), Elevation of Defendant's own interest above those of his
clients;

d.

Factor (E), Negative impact of Defendant's actions on client's
perception of the profession;

e.

Factor (G), Impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the
representation, namely the expectation that some 01' all of their medical
expenses would be paid with the funds retained in Simmons' trust account
for that purpose from their settlements;

f.

Factor (H), Effect of Defendant's conduct on third parties, namely the
medical providers who did not get paid money they might have otherwise
been paid;

g.

Factor (1), Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication by
making false entries on the memo lines of the checks by which Simmons
misappropriated entrusted funds from his trust account to disguise the
misappropriations.

h.

Factor (A), Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication;

1.

Factor (C), Misappropriation or conversion of assets of any kind to which
Defendant or recipient was not entitled, from his clients;

j.

Factor (D), Commission of a felony;

27 N.C.A.C. 1B § .Ol14(w)(3)

k.

Factor (A), Prior disciplinary offense;

I.

Factor (B), Remoteness of the prior offense. However, although the prior
conduct is remote, the finding in the prior disciplinary order concerning

-13-

presentation of false or misleading or deceptive evidence remains relevant
to this proceeding;

3.

m.

Factor (C), Dishonest or selfish motive;

n.

Factor (F), A pattern of misconduct;

o.

Factor (G), Multiple offenses;

p.

Factor (N), Submission of false evidence, false statements, or other
deceptive practices dUl'ing the disciplinary process;

q.

Factor (0), Refusal to acknowledge wrongful natUl'e of the conduct;

r.

Factor (Q), Good character and reputation in the community, and a
reputation for truthfulness and veracity in the community; and

s.

Factor (S), Substantial degree of experience in the practice of law.

Defendant caused significant harm to his clients by misappropriating their funds.

4.
Defendant caused significant harm to medical providers who should have
received payments from funds Defendant misappropriated.
5.
Defendant has caused significant harm and potential harm to clients whose funds
he should have in his trust account but for whom he has insufficient funds in his trust account.
6.
Defendant's repeated commission of criminal acts reflecting adversely on his
honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer, his dishonest and deceitful conduct in placing
false information on trust account checks to disguise his misappropriation, and the presentation
of testimony that conflicted with the credible evidence received in the case caused significant
harm to the legal profession by undermining trust and confidence in lawyers and the legal
system.
7.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and finds that disbarment is
the only sanction that can adequately protect the public. An attorney's duty to preserve funds
entrusted to the attorney is one of the most sacred that an attorney undeltakes. The attorney
should never violate that duty of trust.
8.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and finds that suspension of
Defendant's license or a public censure, reprimand, or admonition would not be sufficient
discipline because of the gravity of the actual and potential harm to his clients, the public, and
the legal profession caused by Defendant's conduct, and the threat of potential significant harm
Defendant poses to the public. The Hearing Panel has considered the evidence of Defendant's
good character and pro bono service. However, given the repeated acts of dishonesty,
misrepresentation, and deceit by Simmons established by the evidence presented at hearing and

-14-

the significant harm and potential harm caused by Simmons established by the evidence and as
itemized above, the evidence concerning Defendant's good character and pro bono service does
not warrant imposition of lesser discipline.
9.
The Hearing Panel has considered all lesser sanctions and finds that discipline
short of disbarment would not adequately protect the public for the following reasons:
a.

Defendant engaged in misconduct constituting felonies and violations of
the trust of his clients and the public;

b.

Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Defendant committed and
would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the
conduct expected of members of the Bar ofthis State; and

c.

The protection of the public and the legal profession reqUIres that
befendant not be permitted to resume the practice of law until he
demonstrates the following: that he has reformed; that he understands his
obligations to his clients, the public, the cOUIis, and the legal profession;
and that reinstatement will not be detrimental to the public or the integrity
and standing of the legal profession. Disbarred lawyers are required to
make such a showing before they may resume practicing law, whereas no
such showing of reformation is required of attorneys whose licenses are
suspended.

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and additional Findings of
Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel hereby enters the
following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

1.

Defendant, Geoffrey H. Simmons, is hereby DISBARRED from the practice of
