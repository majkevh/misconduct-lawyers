interest was 12%, you engaged in conduct that adversely reflects on your
fitness to practice law in vlolation of DRl-I02(A) (6). Although Ms. strayhorn
was not your client, you were on notice that she. was not represente1 by
independent cotmsel aild that she was not sophisticated in matters. of business
or law. This financial transaction clearly smacks of overreaching am Y9Ur .
willingness to part;icipate in it does not reflect well on you as a member of
the Bar.
