convincing evidence the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT

1.

Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar ("plaintiff' or "State Bar"), is a body duly
organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this proceeding under
the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, and the Rules
and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar (Chapter 1 of Title 27 of the North Carolina
Administrative Code).

Defendant, C. Gary Triggs ("defendant" or "Triggs"), was admitted to the North
Carolina State Bar on August 19, 1973, and is, and was at all times referred to herein, an attorney
at law licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the laws of the State of North Carolina,
the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and the Rules of Professional
Conduct.
3.
During all or a portion of the relevant periods referred to herein, defendant was
engaged in the private practice of law with a law office located in the town of Morganton, Burke
County, North Carolina. Defendant's present law office is located in the town of Hildebran,
Burke County, North Carolina.

Dorothea A. Anderson
5.
Dorothea A. Anderson was injured in an automobile accident on August 12,2005
and retained defendant to represent her in a personal injury action.
6.
On December 13, 2006, the insurance claims supervisor wrote to defendant
indicating that the adjuster had made numerous attempts to obtain an update on Ms. Anderson's
injuries since July 2006, but had not "received the professional courtesy of a call, letter or
otherwise from [defendant] or someone from [defendant's] office." Defendant made a
handwritten notation on the letter asking his paralegal to provide him an update so he could
respond.
7.
On June 11,2008, the insurance company claims representative requested
documentation from defendant for Ms. Anderson's medical bills. The letter indicated that the
representative had made "multiple requests for this documentation with no response." Another
handwritten notation by defendant on the letter requested his paralegal to contact Ms. Anderson
and "make sure we send the med[ical] reports. Ifwe don't have then request them."
8.
A July 2, 2008 letter from a mediator to defendant indicated that the mediator had
unsuccessfully attempted to contact defendant on several occasions to let defendant know that
the insurance company claims representative was interested in resolving Ms. Anderson's claim
through mediation.
9.
Defendant replied to the mediator on July 7,2008 confirming Ms. Anderson's
interest in mediation and suggesting several attorneys for mediation.
10. On July 29,2008, the insurance company claims representative wrote to defendant
restating her April 3, 2008 offer to settle Ms. Anderson's claim for $6,070. A handwritten
notation on the letter by defendant directed his paralegal to copy Ms. Anderson with the letter for
her comment, and requested the paralegal to "please stay on top of this so we can get it settled
for [Ms. Anderson]. Be sure to mark SOL [statute of limitations] date on system."
11. Defendant had a system established within his office by which flies were assigned
to a paralegal to ensure that the statute of limitations was marked and the files would be handled
in a timely fashion.
12. A handwritten notation by defendant's legal assistant to defendant dated August 4,
2008 noted Ms. Anderson's medical bills and that the legal assistant had telephoned Ms.
Anderson to leave a message asking if Ms. Anderson had any other bills. Another handwritten
notation that same date by the legal assistant noted that Ms. Anderson had returned the telephone
call and reported that she did not have any other medical bills. The handwritten notations did not
mention discussion of the settlement offer by the insurance company.
13. Ms. Anderson denied being informed by defendant or defendant's employees of the
insurance company's settlement offer or mediation overture. Defendant produced no
documentation that he or his employees informed Ms. Anderson of the settlement offer or
mediation interest by the insurance company. The panel finds Ms. Anderson's testimony to be
credible.
-2-

14.

Ms. Anderson's claim was never settled with the insurance company or mediated.

15. Defendant did not file Ms. Anderson's personal injury action within the three year
statute oflimitations (August 12, 2008 deadline).
16. Ms. Anderson testified that over the course of the four years after she retained
defendant, she made numerous calls to defendant and his office to check on the status of the
personal injury action, but defendant never returned her calls or responded to her messages.
Other than the handwritten notations referenced in Paragraph 12 above, defendant produced no
documentation that he or his employees responded to Ms. Anderson's status inquiries. The panel
finds Ms. Anderson's testimony to be credible.
17. On March 10, 2011, Ms. Anderson requested that defendant provide her all of her
file by March 17, 2011. Defendant did not comply with Ms. Anderson's request for her file until
August 11,2011, approximately five (5) months later.
Gregory Allen Oates

18. Defendant represented Gregory Allen Oates ("Greg Oates") in a domestic and
parental rights action in Burke County District Court.
19. On June 18, 2010, defendant filed on behalf of Greg Oates a responsive pleading to
a Summons and Petition to Terminate Parental Rights in Burke County District Court.
20. In support of the June 18,2010 filing, defendant attached a verification which
originally had been executed by Greg Oates's father ("William M. Oates") on July 8, 2008 in
connection with a motion to intervene by Greg Oates's parents in the custody action between
Greg Oates and his ex-wife.
21. The verification attached to defendant's June 18,2010 filing was not executed by
Greg Oates.
22. The signatory to the verification ("William M. Oates") did not appear before the
notary public and sign the document on the date the verification was purportedly executed.
23. Defendant's paralegal, without the knowledge of defendant, altered the date on the
verification from July 8, 2008 to June 18, 2010, altered the date on which the Notary Public
purportedly notarized the signature from July 8, 2008 to June 18,2010, and altered the date of
the expiration of the Notary Public's certification from November 3, 2008 to November 3, 2013.
24. Following an investigation by the Notary Enforcement Section of the North
Carolina Secretary of State, defendant's paralegal was found to have notarized a document
without the personal appearance ofthe principal in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง IOB-60(c)(I),
as well as having failed to administer an oath or affirmation in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง
IOB-3(2)(14). As a result, the notary public commission of defendant's paralegal was suspended
for four (4) months.

-3-

25. On July 27, 2010, the State Bar opened grievance file number 10G0722 and sent
defendant a Letter of Notice requiring his response to allegations about the false notarization.
Defendant received the Letter of Notice on or about August 11,2010.
26. In his September 17,2010 response to the Letter of Notice and hearing testimony,
defendant stated that upon learning of the mistaken verification attached to the filed pleading,
defendant telephoned his opposing counsel, Mr. Jonathan L. Jones of Morganton, North
Carolina, "who had not noticed the problem and advised him of what had occurred."
27. Mr. Jones testified that during the telephone call referenced in Paragraph 28 above,
defendant only mentioned that Greg Oates had changed his mind and had decided not to contest
the termination of his parental rights. According to Mr. Jones' recollection, it was not until after
defendant received the Letter of Notice from the State Bar that defendant informed Mr. Jones of
the false notarization and of the fact that the signature on the verification did not belong to Greg
Oates.
28. In his September 17, 2010 response to the Letter of Notice and testimony, defendant
stated he did not believe at the time that it was inappropriate to utilize pre-signed verifications,
without the person's personal appearance and oath before the notary public on the date so
notarized, provided that the person reviewed the documents prior to filing.
Nora Helen Sparks
29. Nora Helen Sparks (formerly Helen Williams) ("Ms. Sparks") retained defendant to

possession of her vehicle; prohibited Mr. Williams from having contact with Ms. Sparks except
through legal counsel; enjoined Mr. Williams from selling or disposing of any marital property;
and scheduled a hearing for May 16, 2007.

pending further order.
34. On July 17,2007, the court directed Ms. Sparks to file affidavits for equitable

affidavits by October 1,2007.

the court.
36. On October 26, 2007, defendant filed a Motion for New Trial pursuant to
N. C. R. Civ. P. 59, asserting that he had forwarded to the court a notice of his conflict with the
hearing scheduled for Monday, October 22, 2007, and that Ms. Sparks' failure to file her
affidavits by the August 31, 2007 deadline was "an inadvertence due to change of staff within
the office of the Plaintiff amounting to excusable negligent [sic]." On November 29, 2007, Mr.
Williams' attorney filed a motion to dismiss Ms. Sparks' Rule 59 motion and to disburse funds.
37. Defendant's Rule 59 motion and Mr. Williams' motion to disburse funds (matters

violation of Rule 1.4(a)(2), and failed to keep his client reasonably informed
about the status of the client's case in violation of Rule 1.4(a)(3);

for doing so, and by waiting for over one year from the dismissal of Ms. Estes'
appeal to petition for a belated appeal on her behalf, defendant failed to act with

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and upon the
evidence and arguments presented at the hearing concerning appropriate discipline, the Hearing
Panel hereby finds the following:

FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
On June 25, 200S, the Disciplinary Hearing Commission panel imposed a five
year stayed suspension of defendant's law license (06DHC30) for failing to pay employee
withholding taxes to the Internal Revenue Service in violation of Rules S.4(b) and S.4(c); failing
to maintain funds in his trust account in violation of Rule 1.15-2(a); utilizing entrusted funds to
his own benefit in violation of Rule 1.15-2(j); and, borrowing from a client in violation of Rule
I.S(a)(1)-(3).
2.
In imposing the five-year stayed suspension in 200S, the chairperson ofthe panel
cautioned Defendant that he was being given "one more shot."
3.
The conditions of the stay of the suspension of defendant's law license in 200S
included, among others, that he not violate any provision of the Rules of Professional Conduct
and that he participate in the State Bar's Fee Dispute Resolution procedure.
4.
In March 1996, defendant received a Censure (95GOOI2IV) for borrowing from
clients in violation of Rule l.S(a)(l), and not repaying the clients timely in violation of Rule
5.4(a).
5.
In August 2006, defendant received an Admonition (05G 1293) for untimely
responding to the State Bar's request for trust account records in violation of Rule S.l.
6.
In February 2009, defendant received a Censure (07G0151, 0626, 1050, 1143, &
1156) for failing to respond to a fee dispute in violation of 1.5(f); failing to withdraw as counsel
as requested by a client in violation of Rule 1.16(d); failing to produce files to a client in
violation of Rule 1. 16(d); charging an excessive fee for telephone calls in violation of 1.5(a);
and, in violation of Rule l.4(a), failing to communicate to a client that a Motion for Summary
Judgment had been allowed in the client's matter.
7.
In May 2012, defendant received an Admonition (11 G0977) for failing to notify
an appellate client that the client's appeal had been dismissed in violation of Rule 1.4(a)(3).
S.
Contrary to the conditions of the 200S stayed suspension of defendant's law
license, defendant received an Admonition in May 2011 (11 G0977) for failing to notify an
appellate client that the client's appeal had been dismissed in 2011. In 2010, defendant twice

-17-

agreed to refund client Bradley Brown in a fee dispute, and then twice failed to do so by
defendant's own deadlines.
9.
In violation of other conditions of the 2008 stayed suspension of his law license,
defendant also failed: (l) to provide to the State Bar written reports by a certified public
accountant for July 1,2011, January 1, 2012, and July 1, 2012; (2) to provide his federal and
state tax returns for the first, second, and third quarters of2011; and, (3) to provide practice
monitor reports for April 15, 2011 through October 15,2012.
10.
David Greer testified that defendant's representation of the Greers had caused him
to have a negative impression of the legal profession in general, and of Defendant in particular.
11.
Defendant's current employees testified that improved office procedures had been
implemented beginning in late 2008 to improve responsiveness to clients and accountability.
12.

Defendant introduced affidavits supporting his good character and reputation.

13.
Plaintiff proffered the rebuttal testimony of Fred Moses concerning defendant's
character and reputation, but the panel agreed to strike and not consider Mr. Moses' testimony
given that he was not included on Plaintiff's stipulated list of potential witnesses.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
lBยง .0114(w)(l), (2) and (3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and
finds the following factors are applicable in this matter:
General Factors from 27 N.C.A.C. 1Bยง .0114(w)(3)
a)

Prior disciplinary offenses in this state;

b)

Remoteness in time of some of the prior disciplinary offenses;

c)

Indifference to making restitution;

d)

A pattern of misconduct;

e)

Multiple offenses;

f)

Full and free disclosure to the hearing panel and a cooperative attitude
toward the proceeding;

g)

Character and reputation; and

h)

Significant experience in the practices of law.

-18-

Suspension and Disbarment Factors from 27 N.C.A.C. IBยง .0114(w)(1)
a)

Intent of defendant to commit acts where the hann or potential for hann to
his clients was foreseeable;

b)

Circumstances reflecting defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness, or
integrity;

c)

Negative impact of defendant's actions on client's or public's perception of
the legal profession;

d)

Impairment of his clients' ability to achieve the goals of their representation;
and

e)

Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, and deceit.
Disbarment Factor from 27 N.C.A.C. IBยง .0114(w)(2)

a)

Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, and deceit.

2.
The Hearing Panel concludes that many of defendant's violations of the Rules of
Professional Conduct as found herein occurred after defendant received the five-year stayed
suspension in 2008.
3.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all ofthe different forms of discipline
available to it.
4.
An admonition, reprimand, censure, or suspension of defendant's license would
not be sufficient discipline because of the gravity of the actual hann defendant's conduct caused
to the public, the administration of justice and the legal profession, and the significant potential
harm to the public, the administration of justice, and the legal profession if defendant were
permitted to continue practicing law.
5.
The Hearing Panel concludes that discipline short of disbarment would not
adequately protect the public, the legal profession, or the administration of justice for the
following reasons:
a) The five-year stayed suspension ordered in 2008, as well as previous public
discipline, has not deterred defendant from habitual, uncolTected neglect of
clients. Habitual neglect of clients shows that the defendant is untrustworthy;
particularly when defendant has failed to take adequate cOlTective measures
after receiving prior discipline for similar conduct;
b) Misconduct involving misrepresentation or deceit is among the most serious
that any attorney can commit. The Hearing Panel has found that defendant
engaged in acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation and deceit towards two of his
clients, the Schoenens and Greers, in violation of Rule 8.4(c). Such

-19-

misconduct demonstrates that defendant is not trustworthy. The public should
be able to assume that all attorneys are trustworthy; and
c) Entry of an order imposing lesser discipline would fail to acknowledge the
seriousness of the offenses committed by defendant, would fail to
acknowledge his prior discipline, would be inconsistent with discipline issued
in prior cases involving similar misconduct, and would send the wrong
message to defendant, to other attorneys, and the public regarding the conduct
expected of members of the State Bar.
6.
The protection of the public and the legal profession requires that defendant not
be permitted to resume the practice of law until he demonstrates the following:
a) That he has reformed;
b) That he understands his obligations to his clients, the public, the legal
profession and the administration of justice; and
c) That permitting him to practice law will not be detrimental to the public, or
the integrity and standing of the legal profession and the administration of
justice.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Findings of Fact
Regarding Discipline, and Conclusions Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the
following:
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

1.
Defendant, C. Gary Triggs, is hereby DISBARRED from the practice of law,
effective 30 days from the date of service of this order upon him.
2.
Defendant is taxed with the costs and administrative fees of this action, including
the cost of the depositions taken in this matter as allowed by statute. The deposition costs were
necessarily incurred for the prosecution of this proceeding. Defendant will receive a statement
of costs from the Secretary of the State Bar and defendant shall pay these costs within 90 days of
service of the notice of costs upon him.
Signed by the undersigned Chair with full knowledge and consent of the other
members of the Hearing Committee.
