The de,ep feelings of :Lack o,f ,self-worth, d,ep,res:s,;i..on and.

clients. Most of: these clients have not been compensated.
the majority's or?ler of discipline assures that they will
remain unrecompensed.

I~'

,

I

••

In my view, the shortcoming of the major'ity's order
of discipline disbarring the defendartt without more, passes
up an opportunitylto deal severely with ludlow and, at the
same time, to provide motivation for him to overcome his
problems and. to provide for 'restitution to his victims.

i
I

i

1

I feel tha~ the appropriate discipline in this case
should be a suspension for the maximum period of three years
upon the conditio~ ~ that the defendant's reinstatement be.
cond-i tioned upon: ~
.
.
I

l)

His demonstrating that he has overc"ome any
alcohol or alcohol related problems;

2)

His deilionstrating that he has overcome any
psychiatric, mental or emotional problems;

3)

He making restitution to each of his uncompensated clients related to these offenses
and/bran accounting to any such client who
reques·1;::s it; and
.

4.

His detilOnstrating to 'the satisfaction of
the Ba~ that he understands the operation
and management o,f trust accounts for lawyers.

I

1

The majority's order of discipline provides simply for
disbarmertt" , Ludlow can apply for reinstatement after five
years. Previous ~ to the re'cent 1984 a~endtnertts, he would have
been able to apply for reinstatement,4pon disbarment after
three years, the same period of t.ime that I would impose
for his sU'speilsiol1.
,
I f.~el tha~ the majority' s uhders~tandab1e d'esire to
shew the public and the defendant that we will deal severely
with thes'e kinds of offenses, blinded them to the other ends
of discipline whic,h could have been served by requiring
something positive of the defendant.

I"

I

For the fo~egoing reasons~ I a~ compelled to file this
minority opinion r:egarding the di.scipline, imposed.
