The Defendant did not account to his client for his
handling of the money entrusted tohi.m until after Hodge
co~plairied to the North Carolina State Bar about his conduct in
1985.
Based upon the foregoing FINDINGS OF FACT,
makes the following CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:
(a)

(b)

(c)

By failing to segregate client funds from
person~l funds, the Defendant commingled
t~ust funds and personal ~unds in violation
of Disciplinary Rule 9-102(A) of the North
Carolina Cod~ of Professional Responsibility;

.'

.
By using client
funds entru6ted to him for.
unauthorized purposes, in~luding the payment
of his own obligations, the Defendant engaged
in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude,
engag~d in conduct involving dishonesty,
fraud, deceit or misrepresentati~n, engaged
in other professional conduct that adversely
ref I e ~ t son his fit n e s s t 0 p r a c't ice 1 a'w, a n·d
failed to maintain client funds in trust in
violati~n of Disciplinary Rules 1-102(A)(3),
(4) and (6) and 9-102(A)~ respectively, of
the Nor~h Car~lina Code of Professi6nal
Res,ponsibili ty;
,

By failing to provide his client with a
timely actounting of his handling of her
funds, the Defendant failed to render
appropriate accounts to his client regarding
his handling of those funds in violation of
Disciplinary Rule 9~102(B)(3) of the North
Caioli~a Code of Professional Responsibility.

1. Durins the course bf the North Carolina State Bar's
Grievance Committee's investigation of the Defendant's
misconduct, the Ghairmart of the Grievance Committee issued a
formal Letter of Notice to the DeEendant demanding an e~planation
for his alleged misconduct.
2.
On or about July 31, 1985, the Defen4ant submitted a
response to the Letter of Notice supplemented by various
e~hibitS.
In an undated letter addressed to Mrs. Pearlie Mae
Hodge which was submitted ,by the Defendant.as an exhibit, the
Defendant purported to accou~t for his 'handling of his client's
money.
In that letter the Defendant noted that he had disbursed
$5,000.00 to himself as his attorney's Eee relative to,the
settlement of ~he accidental death claim from the sum of

3.
In October, 19S5, in response to a subpoena of finan¢ial
records issued by t·he Chairman of the Griev~nce COlll!llittee, the
Defendant submitted an undate'd letter with attachm:ents 'ad,d.r'es.se,d
~o Mr. Joseph B. Cheshire, Jr.,. V1~a-Chair~an of the .Grievan~e
Co~mittee, in which he purported to account for hi~ handltng o~
his' client's money.
In that lette,r and an attachment 'the
Defendant again noted that he had disbursed $5,000.00 to himsslf
as hi:s att;:orney's fee relative to settlement of the accidental.
death claim from the sum of $69,496.00 which he had received i~
trutt on his client's behalf. but did not discl~se that he had.
al~o b~en paid in full for his servLces by'U.5.F.& G.
4.
In light of the seriousness of ~he allege~ miscond~ct.
and the fa~t that the Defendant twice failed in submissiorts to
th~ Grievance Co_mittee to note that he had been ~.idin iulI by
U.S.F. & G., the Committee finds that the Defendant's (j,miss:i,onof
that material fact wa~ intentional.
Based upon the foregoi·ng FIN'DINGS OF FACT, the CO'll1):1l:t,'tte'e
makes the following CONCLUSIONS. OF LAW:
The Defendant, by submitting an incomplete an:df raudule,n t
accounting to his client and the Grievance Committee1 engaged ·i~
cond~ct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, ormis~spresen~ation,
and engaged in professional conduct that adversely refLerits o~ .
his fitness to practice law in violation of Disci~linaryRulss
1-102(A)(4) and (6) of the North Carolina Code ofPrafessional
Re~ponslbility and knowingly misrepresen~ed' facts regatdin~ an
