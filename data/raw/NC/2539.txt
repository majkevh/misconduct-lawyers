Grievance Committee found probable cause. Probable cause is defined in the rules as'

mi,sconduct justifying disciplinary action."

cases in which an attorney has violated one Or more prOVisions of the Revised Rules of
Professional Conduct and has caused harrli or potential hatm to a client, the administration of
justice, the profession,. or a member of the public, but the misconduct does not require a censure.

competence to db so. You failed to file RB's claim before it was barred by the statute of
limitation and failed to advise RB properly as to the date when his claim would be time barred.
