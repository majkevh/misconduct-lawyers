I

,

.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. All parties are properly before the hearing .committee of the Disciplinary Bearing
Commission and the hearing committee has jurisdiction over Brown and the subject matter.
2. Brown's co·nduct, as set out above, constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C.
, Gen. Stat. ~ 84-28(a) & (b)(2) and §84-28(b)(3}as follows:
(a)
By failing to file an amended complaint on Singletary'S behalf within the time
allowed by Eliason, Brown failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in
teptbenting Singletary in violation of Rule 1.3;
(b) i By failing to timely,infotm Singietary that his case had been dismissed, Brown
failed to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Singletary to make
infoimed decisions about the representation in violation of Rule lA(b);

I

(c)
By failing to return Singletary'S calls seeking an update of the status of his matter,
BroWn failed to keep Singletary reasonably informed about the status of his matter and
proIl(ptly comply with reasonable requests for information in violation of Rule lA(a).
BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Conclusions of Law, and the evidence
presented at:the hearing, the hearing committee hereby makes the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. Brown's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
I

(a)

Prior discipline, including a Censure issued by the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission in 00 DHC 11 and a Reprimand issued by SuperIor Court
Judge Catherine C. Eagles in April 4001; and

(b)

Substantial experience in the practice of law.

2. BroWn's misconduct is mitigated by the following factor:
(a)

Absence of a dishonest or selfish motive;

(b)

Brown reimbursed the $1,500.00 legal fee that Singletary paid him with
interest;

(c)

Brown was prepared to present evidence at the hearing of his good
character and his reputation for truthfulness from a number of respected
members of the Bat.

I

I

3. The mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating factors. Although Brown has
been disciplined twice before, there is no evidence that Brown has ignored the lessons
from the prior discipline since his conduct in this matter is so dissimUar to the conduct for
which he was previou~;ly disciplined.
4. Because Singletary lost his opportunity to pursue his claim against MGM in
federal court, Brown's conduct caused significant harm to Singletary, but the protection
of the pUblic doesn't requite a suspension of Brown's license.

I

BASED UPON ~e foregoing Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline and the consent of
the p~ies, the h~l3l'ing committee hereby enters the following:
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1.. The discipline to be imposed in this matter is a Censure. The Censure, of even date
. herewith, accompanies this Order.
2. Brown is taxed with the costs of this action as assessed by the Secretary, including the
deposition costs.
~.iined by the chair with the consent of the other hearing committee members, this

the !t1f~ay of June, 2004.

CENSURE

I

;This matter came before a hearing committee of the bisciplinary Hearing
Commi;ssion composed ofF. Lane Williamson, Chair, John M. May, and Lorraine
Stephel)s upon.the consent of the parties as to the findings, conclusions and discipline to
be imposed. The hearing committee's Consent Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and
Order of Discipline are being entered contemporaneously with this Censure.
The hearing Gommittee found that you had violated some of the Revised Rules of
ProfeSSIonal Conduct, and ordered that you be censurecl. This document constitutes that
censure~

A censure is a written fOrin of discipline more serious than a reprimand issued in
cases in which an attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Revised Rules of
Professional Conduct and has caused Significant harm or potentially significant harm to a
client, the administration of justice, the profession, or a member of the public, but the
misconduct does not require suspension of the attorney's license.
You were retained by Joseph Singletary to file an amended complaint for him in a
federal <;:ourt employment case within a specific deadline set by Magistrate Judge Russell
A. Eliason. You failed to file an amended complaint on Singletary's behalf within the
time all<;>wed by Judge Eliason. You failed to act with reasonable diligence and
promptness in representing Singletary in violation of Rule 1.3 of the Rev.ised Rules of
Professional Conduct.

I

I

I

After Singletary's case was dismissed by Judge N. Carlton Tilley, Jr., Chief Judge
of the United States District Court fotthe Middle District of North Carolina, you failed to
inform Singletary that his case had been dismissed for almost sixteen months. By failing
to timely inform Singletary about the dismissal of his case, you failed to explain a matter
to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Singletary to mak~ infonned decisions about
the repr~sentation in viol~tion of Rule lA(b) of the Revised Rules of Professional
Conduct.

I
?1L(

After Singletary's case had been dismissed, Singletary made several calls to your
office to get a status update. You initially failed to return Singletary's calls. By failing to
return Sillgletary's calls s~eking an update of the status of his matter, you f~iled to keep
Singletary reasonably informed about the status of his matter and promptly comply with
reasonable requests for information in violation of Rule l.4(a) of the Revised Rules of
Profes~ional Conduct.

I

The hearing committee of the Disciplinary Hearing Commission hereby censures
you for your professional misconduct. The hearing committee hopes that 'you will heed
this censure, that it will be remembered by you, that it will be beneficial to you, and that
you will never again allow yourself to depart from adherence to the high ethical standards
of the legal profession.
