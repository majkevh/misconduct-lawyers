'On July 16, 1992,. the Grievance committee of the North carolina state Bar
met and considered the grievance filed against you by the North carolina state

Bar.

Pursuant to section 13 (A) of article IX of the Rules and Regulations of
the,North Carolina state Bar, the Grievance committee corrlucted a prel.iminal:y
hearing. After considering the ihfonnation available to -it, ,including your
response to the letter of notice, the GrieVance Conunittee found. probable
cause. Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable cause to believe
that a member of the North carolina state Bar is guilty of misconduct
justifying disciplinary action." _
The rules provide that after a firrling of probable cause, the Grievance
Conunittee may detennil-ile that the filing of a corrplaint and a hearing before
the Disciplinary Hearing Conunissibn are not required and the 'Grievance
Conunittee may issUe variouS levels -of discipline deperrling upon the
misconduct, the actual or potential.injury caused, and any aggravating' or
mitigating factors. The Grievance committee may issue an admonition,
reprimand, or censure' to the reSporrlent attorney.'
,

A reprimand is a written fonn of discipline more serious than an

admonition issued in cases in which an attorney has violated one or more
provisions of the Rules of Professional Corrluct and has caused
or
potential hann to a client, the administration of justice; the profession, or
a member of the public, but the misconduct does not require a censure.

would be able to receive,irl the case. ' You failed to mention yo~',error o+' the.
