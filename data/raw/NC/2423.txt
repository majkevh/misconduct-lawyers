personal problems during the relevant period of time;

cooperative attitude toward the proceedings;

(e)

good character and reputation; and

remorse.

reprimand or other severe discipline, even though Mack's conduct caused hartn to the
State Bar's attempt to resolve Mack's client's fee dispute and caused harm because the
matt~r had to be resolved by the disciplinary process.
