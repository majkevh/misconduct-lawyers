Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Panel enters the following:

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. All parties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the Panel has
jurisdiction over the Defendant, Jerry M. Smith, and the subject matter of this
proceeding.
2. Defendant's conduct, as set out In the Findings of Fact above,
constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C.G.S. ยง84-28(b)(2) as follows:
a. by failing to follow through in determining the amount of Mr. Miller's
Medicare lien and failing to properly disburse trust funds belonging to clients or

3

third parties, Defendant did not act with reasonable diligence and promptness in
representing a client in violation of Rule 1.3;
b. by failing to respond to the inquiries of Ms. Robertson, her son and Mr.
Miller's attorney, Defendant failed to keep his clients reasonably informed about
the status of their matters and did not promptly cornply with reasonable requests
for information in violation of Rule 1.4(a)(3) and (4);
c. by failing to timely disburse funds held on behalf of clients, Defendant
did not promptly payor deliver to the client entrusted property belonging to the
client or to third parties and to which the client or third parties were currently
entitled in violation of Rule 1.15-2(a) and (rn);
d. by failing to properly disburse client funds remaining in his attorney
trust account when he stopped practicing law, Defendant did not take steps
reasonably necessary to protect the clients' interests in violation of Rule 1.16(d);
e. by failing prepare and maintain client ledger cards, Defendant failed to
maintain a ledger containing a record of receipts and disbursements for each
person from whom and for whom funds are received and showing the current
balance of funds held in the trust account for each such person in violation of
Rule 1.15-3(b)(5); and
f. by failing to reconcile his trust account at least quarterly, Defendant
failed to total and reconcile the account with the current bank balance each
quarter in violation of Rule 1.15-3(c).

Based upon the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel also finds by
clear, cogent and convincing evidence the following

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. There is no evidence that any of Defendant's actions relating to his
trust account described in the Findings of Fact above were intentional
misappropriations but rather were the result of gross inattention to the status of
the account in general. However, such mismanagement in the handling of client
funds puts the entrusted funds at risk and erodes the confidence clients place in
attorneys who handle their affairs. As a result, such conduct hamrs the
profession as a whole.
2. Ms. Robertson receives Social Security retirement benefits. Because
of Defendant's delay in disbursing funds to Medicare for Ms. Robertson's benefit,
the U.S. Treasury sought reimbursement by deducting funds from Ms.
Robertson's monthly Social Security checks for a period of time. Defendant has

4

since fully reimbursed Medicare from the funds held in trust on behalf of Ms.
Robertson, including interest accrued that Defendant paid from his own funds.
3. Ms. Robertson and Mr. Miller both relied on Defendant to handle their
funds in a prompt and efficient manner. Defendant's lack of action and
communication about the status of their funds delayed resolution of their financial
matters and caused them anxiety over the uncertainty of the status of their funds.
3. Defendant's conduct reflects a pattem of misconduct in that the trust
account mismanagement occurred over a period of years.
4. Defendant has never been disciplined by the State Bar.
5. In this proceeding before the Disciplinary Hearing Commission
Defendant fully and freely disclosed the facts and circumstances surrounding the
subject of this action and was cooperative in his participation.
6. Defendant has expressed remorse for his conduct.
7. Defendant did not act with a dishonest or selfish motive when he
engaged in the conduct described in the Findings of Fact above relating to his
trust account.
8. During the time of the actions described in the Findings of Fact,
Defendant was suffering from undiagnosed depression that contributed to
Defendant's inaction in handling entrusted funds. Since Defendant was initially
contacted by the State Bar regarding his conduct, Defendant has been under the
care of a psychologist and psychiatrist.

Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional
Findings Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel also enters the following

CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline avaiiable to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the
factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง.0114(w)(1) of the Rules and Regulations
of the North Carolina State Bar and concludes the following factors warrant
suspension of Defendant's license:
(a) Defendant's actions potentially had a negative impact on the public's
perception of the legal profession; and

5

(b) Defendant's actions impaired his clients' ability to achieve the goals of
the representation.
2. The Hearing Panel has also considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง.0114(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina
State Bar and concludes no factors are present in this instance that would
warrant disbarment.
3. The Hearing Panel has also considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง.0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina
State Bar and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a) Defendant's lack of prior disciplinary offenses;
(b) Absence of a dishonest or selfish motive;
(c) Defendant engaged in multiple offenses;
(d) Defendant engaged in a pattern of misconduct;
(e) Defendant's psychological condition contributed to his inaction in
properly distributing the funds in his trust account;
(f) Defendant's full and free disclosure to the Hearing Panel and
cooperative attitude toward the proceedings;
(g)

Defendant's remorse; and

(h) The VUlnerability of Defendant's clients.
4. The Hearing Panel has considered issuing an admonition, reprimand
or censure but concludes that such discipline would not be sufficient discipline
because of the gravity of the actual harm to his clients and the potential harm to
client funds. The Panel further concludes that such discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses committed by Defendant and send
the wrong message to attorneys regarding the conduct expected of members of
the Bar in this State.
5. For the nature and extent of Defendant's trust account violations and
the protection of the public, this Panel would consider an active suspension of
Defendant's license to practice law if it were not for the factors in Defendant's
favor, Defendant's recognition of the impropriety of his conduct and his
commitment to refrain from such conduct in the future. Given those
circumstances, the Hearing Panel finds and concludes that the public will be
adequately protected by suspension of Defendant's license, stayed for a period
of time with conditions imposed upon Defendant designed to ensure protection of

6

the public and Defendant's continued compliance with the Rules of Professional
Conduct.
6. Defendant has informed the hearing panel that he is not currently
practicing law and intends to apply for inactive status with the North Carolina
State Bar pursuant to 27 N.C.A.C. 10 ยง .0901. The intent of this Order of
discipline is to protect the public while Defendant is in practice. Therefore, it
would thwart the intended effect of the hearing panel's discipline if Defendant is
able to avoid complying with the conditions of the stay of this suspension
because he is not actively practicing law or is in inactive status. Furthermore, the
hearing panel recognizes that Defendant's potential transfer to inactive status
cannot occur until the January 2011 meeting of the North Carolina State Bar
Council.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law,
Additional Findings Regarding Discipline, and Conclusions Regarding Discipline,
and upon consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel enters the following

ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

three years from the date this Order of Discipline is served upon him. The period

2. This Order shall be effective on the date Defendant is served with this
Order. However, because Defendant intends to apply for a transfer to inactive
status as noted above, Defendant will not have to comply with conditions 1(b) (e) prior to January 31,2011. In the event Defendant successfully petitions for
and is transferred to inactive status with the North Carolina State Bar pursuant to
27 N.CAC. 1D ยง .0901 by January 31, 2011, the suspension and the period of
the stay of the suspension imposed by this Order shall be tolled until Defendant

transferred to inactive status by January 31, 2011, the suspension and the period
of the stay of the suspension shall remain in effect, and Defendant shall be
subject to all accompanying conditions imposed by this Order until Defendant
successfully transfers to inactive status, at which time any remaining period of
the stayed suspension shall be tolled until Defendant's transfer back to active
status. Once Defendant returns to active status, the suspension, the period of
stayed suspension and all accompanying conditions imposed by this Order shall
once again go into effect for three years minus the time previously served by
Defendant prior to being transferred to inactive status. Nothing in this paragraph
shall serve to toll the requirement to disburse funds in Defendant's account as
provided in condition 1(a) above.
3. If Defendant fails to comply with anyone or more of the provisions of
Paragraph 1 above at any point during the period of time the stayed suspension
is in effect, the stay of the suspension of his law license may be lifted or revoked
