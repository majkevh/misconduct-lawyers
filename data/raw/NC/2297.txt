On Octo~er 18, 2000, the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar met and
considered the gri~vance filed against you by the North Carolina State Bar ..
Pursuant ito section .0113(a) of the Discipline and Disability Rules of the North Carolina
State Bar, the Grievance COlll11llttee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the
information available to it, including your response to the letter of notice, the Grievance
Committee found probable cause. Probable cauSe is defmed in the rules as "reasonable cause to
believe that a member of the North Carolina State Bar is guilty of misconduct justifying

A Reprim!ind is a written form of discipline more seri()~~ than ali Adinonition issued in
cases in which an attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional
Conduct and has caused 4arm or potential ha~ to a client, the administration of justice, the
profession, or a rilember of the public, but the misconduct does not require a Censure.

The Grievance Conuriittee was of the opinion that a CensUre is not required'in this case
and issues this Reprimand to you. As chairman of the Grievance COIIlPlittee of the North
Carolina State Bat, it is now my duty to issue this Reprimand and I am certain that you will
understand fully the spirit in which this duty is perform~d.
'
On apprQximately February 25,2000, you agreed to assume representation of Charlene
Tabitha Giddens for injuries and damages :resulting from a motor vehicle accident on March 3,
1997. -XOll assumed
, this representation because the attorney with whom you shared an-office was
experiencing significant difficulties arid the s4ttute of limitations was about to expire on Ms.
Giddens' claim. You filed a suit on behalf of Ms. Giddens on March 1,2000, prior to the statute of

",

limitations. How~ver, you named and served the wrong defendant in the action~ On March 31 ~
2000,.the defendant served a motion to' dismiss on you base~ 011 this error.

I

On April 4, 2000, you met with your client, Ms. Giddens, and discussed the status of the .
case. You discussed an offer ·of judgment from the defendants, which she decided to dec1iile ..
After you discussions, it was agreed that you would withdraw as counsel in the matter. D-q.ting
this meeting, you prepared a clause entitled "release frop} contract and liability" which you an~
Ms. Giddens signed on that dat~. The relea&e purported to allow you to withdraw from the case
"without liability." The release also stated that:" Ms. Giddens agrees to hold Mr. Robit1So~
harmless from all liability . "
You did not file any motion to withdraw with the court. The motiolI to disnllsS was 4~ard
by the presiding superior court judge on May' 22, 2000. You failed to appear at that hearing, or
to file a: motion to withdraw prior to it. Your client's actions and claims Were dismissed at the .
hearing.

In deciding to issue Reprimand, the Committee considered the foll()wing aggravating and
mitigating. factors.· In aggravation, the Committee considered that your initiai conduct in the c~se .
had caused your client potential harm or prejuqice. The statute of limitations expired before yOU
were able to correct the errors made in tlte initial filing. In mitigation, the Committee conSidered
·the fact that you initially agreed to take the case in a sincere attempt to assist Ms. Gidde1IS in .
pur&uing her claim and preventing the statute of limitations from expiring.
