At its regular quarterly meeting on July 24, 1985, ,the Grievance
CornrtEI:ttee of the North Carolina State Bar'conducted' a prelim:b1ary,hearing ,
under Section 13 of the Discipline and Disbarment Rules of tne North Carolina.
State Bar regarding grievances filed against you by Virgin1.aGr~gory; and
Kenneth Deese. The Committee considered all of the evid~nce before it,
including your writtep statement to the Cormnittee. ,Pursuant; to$ect;':1,op 13.(10.)of the Discipline and Disbarment Rules, theCorrnnittee found probable caQ:s~.
Probable cause is defined under the Discipline and DisbantIent; 'Rt4,es a,~:!: "A
finding by the Grievance Committee that there is reasonable caus~ to beli~ve
that a member of the North Carolina State Bar is gull tyof miscond,uc,t·
ju,stifying disciplinary action." The rulesalsb provide that it" after ai'
finding of probable cause, the Committee determines that a complaint~d ~
hearing are not warranted, the Comm1tteemay issue ;a puIDJ.ic c~nsureupon the
acceptance of the same by the attorney. That determination has b$en made' by
the Corrnnittee and the Committee issues this Public !Censll're: to, YOl,}.

As, Chairman 'of tl1e Grievance CornrrrLttee of the North Caro+ina, ,state;, J3~i' '
it is now my duty to issue'this Public Cen~ure and I am certain that you
'
understand fully the spirit in which this duty is perfor.meg:" t4a~ you will
understand the censure, and appreciate its significance., Th$ fact that a
public c~nsur.e is not the most s~rious discipline ttlat may 'be impol;led,'by the
North Carolina State Bar shoul,d not be taken by you' to' ;trtdicC3,te that 'any' ' ,
member of the Committee feels that your conduct was excusable or less than a
serious and SUbstantial violation of the Code of Prbfe~si'ona1 Responsibility.

On or about January 1, 1982, yoti were employed by V;l:rginia 'W.GregoJ;1Y'ahd

Bennett L. Gregory to represent them in the defense of a la,wsuitfiled by
Suzanne S. Savard and Howard W. Walters relative to the; disso;Lut;io!} 9f: a
partnership. You were paid at least $~,482.16 for your serVices in that
connection.

,I

Although you did renQ.er valuable services to the Gregorys during 1982 and,
the first part of 1983, including the filing of an answer and courtterlclairo, '
you abruptly and unilaterally terminated your representation ,in Apri;I., 19~3~
and left the state of North Carolipa, apparently forfina.tlcialre~f:!6ns. ';:fh
leaving the jurisdiction, you essentially abandoned you,r clients, the
i'

Gregorys. You made no provision for successor counsel and you failed to seek
the permission of your clients or the court to withdraw.
Disciplinary Rule 2~109(A)(2) of the Code of Professional Responsibility
clearly forbids a lawyer to withdraw from employment until he has taken
- reasonable steps to avoiq foreseeable prejudice to the rights of his client,
including giving due notfce to the client of his intention to withdraw and
allowing for the employment of other counsel. Your actions in this case
clearly violated the rul~. In addition, you viola~ed Disciplinary Rule
2-l09(A)(1) by withdrawing from employment in a case pending before a tribunal
without obtaining its permission in advance.

In addition to the Gregorys, at the time of your departure from the
State you were represent~ Kenneth H. Deese relative to certain "claims and
counterclaims ariSing frQm his construction contracts. While it does not
appear that your leaving the state actually prejudiced Mr." Deese, it is clear
that in the months prior ,to your dep~rture, you were neglectful of his legal
bUsiness. In two separate instances, it appears that you neglected to take
certain actions which may have prejudiced your client. You failed to reply to
a counterclaim in litigation you had brought on Mr. Deese's behalf against
Mr. and Mrs. Donald Katz. You also neglected to file suit on behalf of Mr".
Deese against Mr. David Serrell to enforce a contractor's lien which you had
previously filed. These .instances of neglect were apparently indicative of a
general carelessness in the handling of your client's affairs during the
period in question and caused you to Violate Disciplinary Rule 6-l0l(A)(3)
which prohibits a la,wyer ;from neglecting legal matters which have been
entrusted to him.
Lastiy, it would appear that in your hasty and unceremonious departure
from the jurisdiction, you also violated Disciplinary Rules 1-102(A)(5) and
(6) • Those rules prohibit an attorney from engaging in conduct that is
prejudicial to the administration of justice and in conduct which adversely
reflects upon his fitness l to practice law. As you are no doubt aware, your"
Unexplained disappearance from the juriSdiction while acting as counsel of
record in pending litigat:ion necessitated the appointment of a trustee by the
Superior Court of Mecklenburg County to inventory your files and to make
recommendations relative the administration of YQur pending cases.
Considerable time and effort on the part of the State Bar, the Superior Court,
and Ms. Katherine Holliday of the Mecklenburg County Bar was required to
straighten out the confusion you left behinq.

By your actions you violated not only the letter of the Code of
Professional Responsibility but also its spirit. Your conduct was such as to
cast the Courts and your fellow members of the Bar into disrepute, and
obviously jeopardized your continued privilege to practice law in North
Carolina.
A lawyer has responsibilities to his clients and to the Courts which
override financial consid~rations. A lawyer is expected "to fulfill his
promises to his clients if at all possible and, "'tillen impossible, is expected
to insure that his withdrawal from repre$entation is accomplished in an
orderly and lawful manner without unnecessary prejudice to the client. This
fundamental obligation is! compounded by the lawyer's obligation to the Court.

There is no excuse for a lawyer's vanishing in the midst of 'p~nding " ,
,litigation.

,

In issuing this Public Censure, the Grievance Committee wa~ mindful of
your cooperation in its invel;!tigation. It was alsoadve'rteni:! 'tbthe' fact that
there was apparently little actual prejudice to your client~ al;! a c.6neequence,
of your absence from the jurisdiction. That not withstand:l,:ng, theG't?:t;evanee
Committee wishes for you to clearly underetand that anY future derelic.tion of
this sort will not be tolerated and will likely be the subjectof'aswi;et arid,
severe disciplinary response.
