DEFENDANT

This matter was heard on 12, 13, and 14 November 2014 by a hearing panel ofthe Disciplinary
Hearing Commission composed of Steven D. Michael, Chair, Shirley L. Fulton and Patti Head.
Leanor Bailey Hodge represented Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar. Defendant, Lena
Watts-Robinson, appeared pro se.
Based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, the Hearing Panel hereby makes by
clear, cogent and convincing evidence the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT
1.
Plaintiff, the NOlih Carolina State Bar (hereafter "State Bar"), is a body duly
organized under the laws ofNOlih Carolina and is the proper pmiy to bring this proceeding under
the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, and the Rules
and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar promulgated thereunder.
2.
Defendant, Lena Watts-Robinson (hereafter "Defendant" or "Watts-Robinson"),
was admitted to the State Bar on 29 September 2006 and is an Attorney at Law subject to the
rules, regulations, and Rules of Professional Conduct of the North Carolina State Bar and the
laws of the State of North Carolina.
3.
During the relevant period referred to herein, Watts-Robinson was actively
engaged in the practice of law and maintained law offices in Charlotte, Mecklenburg County,
North Carolina and Gastonia, Gaston County, North Carolina.
4.
From I January 2011 through 29 November 2013, Watts-Robinson received and
disbursed entrusted funds on behalf of clients that were either nominal and/or held for a short
telm.
5.
Watts-Robinson was required to deposit these nominal and/or short telm entrusted
funds into a general trust account.
Order of Discipline - 14 DHC 22
Page 1 of16

6.
Pursuant to order of the North Carolina Supreme Court, every general trust
account must be an interest or dividend-bearing account.
7.
Any interest that is generated on funds held in a general trust account must either
be paid to the client on whose funds the interest was earned, or to North Carolina Interest on
Lawyers Trust Account Program (hereafter "IOLTA") in accordance with 27 N.C. Admin. Code
1D § .1316.
8.
The funds received by IOLTA are used for programs concerned with the
improvement of the administration of justice.
9.
From 1 January 2011 through 14 October 2011, Watts-Robinson deposited the
entrusted funds she received for clients into her Wachovia Business High Perfonnance Money
Market Account ending in no. 6677 (hereafter "Wachovia 6677"). Watts-Robinson also
disbursed entrusted funds from tins account.
10.
The owner ofWachovia 6677 was listed on each bank statement as: "Law Office
of Lena Watts-Robinson, Lena Watts-Robinson, Trust Account IOTA [sic]."
11.

Wells-Fargo Bank acquired and/or merged with Wachovia Bank.

12.
As a result of the change in bank ownership, beginning on or about 15 October
2011 the title ofWachovia 6677 changed to Wells Fargo Business Perfonnance Savings Account
ending in no. 6677 (hereafter "Wells Fargo 6677").
13.
TIlere was no reference to "trust account" or "IOTA [sic]" on the bank statements
for Wells Fargo 6677.
14.
The deposits Watts-Robinson made into the Wachovia 6677 and Wells Fargo
6677 accounts earned interest.
15.

Watts-Robinson did not direct the bank to remit the earned interest to IOLTA.

16.
Watts-Robinson did not remit the earned interest to the clients on whose funds the
interest was earned.
17.
As of31 January 2013, Watts-Robinson had disbursed to herself all but $.01 of
any interest that had been earned on any client funds that had been deposited into Wells Fargo
6677 prior to that date.
18.
Watts-Robinson made several disbursements of legal fees to herself from Wells
Fargo 6677 by electronic tr'ansfer that did not indicate on the item the client balance from which
the disbursement was drawn.
19.
Watts-Robinson failed to perfonn quarterly reconciliations ofWachovia 6677 and
Wells Fargo 6677.

Order of Discipline - 14 DHC 22

20.
Pursuant to 27 N.C. Admin. Code ID § .1319 Watts-Robinson was required to
certify ammally to the State Bar that all general trust accounts that she maintained were
established and maintained as IOLTA accounts, or that she was exempt from this provision
because she does not maintain any general trust accounts for North Carolina client funds.
On her 2008 and 2009 mandatory IOLTA certification fOlli, Watts-Robinson
21.
certified that her IOLTA status was exempt because she did not handle client funds because she
was either not in private practice, did not maintain general client trust accounts in North Carolina
or was not practicing in Nmih Carolina.
22.
Although Watts-Robinson falsely indicated that she was exempt ii'om mandatory
IOLTA in 2008 and 2009, she mistakenly made this representation.
23.
Watts-Robinson mistakenly certified on her 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013
mandatory IOLTA certification forms that her firm's general trust account was established as a
Nmih Carolina IOLTA account.
Billips Representation
24.
In or about Januaty 2009, L. Billips (hereafter "Billips") consulted with WattsRobinson about unemployment and employment discrimination matters.
25.
In or about April 2009, Billips retained Watts-Robinson to represent him in the
employment discrimination matter.
26.
Watts-Robinson atld Billips had an hourly fee agreement at the outset of the
representation.
27.
Billips paid Watts-Robinson approximately $9,200 for fees and costs in 2009,
20 I 0 and 20 II pursuant to the hourly fee agreement.
In or about May 2012, Billips and Watts-Robinson changed from an hourly fee
28.
alTangement to a contingent fee atTangement.

29.
At the time that Watts-Robinson suggested to Billips that they enter into a
contingent fee agreement, discovery had already been completed in Billips's employment
discrimination case and the judicial settlement conference had already been held.
30.
The terms of the contingent fee agreement provided that Watts-Robinson would
collect the full hourly fee that she charged throughMay 2012, payment for costs and expenses of
litigation, and 1/3 of any recovery that Billips obtained.
31.

The terms of the contingent fee agreement were not fair and reasonable to Billips.

32.
During Watts-Robinson's representation of Billips, issues arose between WattsRobinson and opposing counsel at the beginning of Billips's 30 June 2011 deposition.

Order of Discipline - 14 DHC 22
Page 3 of16

33.
As a result of these issues, on or about 1 July 2011, opposing counsel filed a
motion to compel and for sanctions, and for an expedited hearing and/or decision.
34.
After declining to hold an expedited hearing, the Federal District Court heard the
motion for sanctions on 3 August 2011.
35.
On 8 August 2011 the Honorable David C. Keesler, Magistrate Judge for The
United States District COUlt for the Western District of North Carolina entered an order in
Billips's employment discrimination case imposing a $2,500 sanction against Watts-Robinson
"because she impeded, delayed, and frustrated the fair examination of her client."
36.
The COUlt's stated purpose for imposing the sanction against Watts-Robinson was
"to deter [Watts-Robinson] from similar conduct in the future, and to compensate Defendant for
some of its expenses."
37.
On 22 May 2012, the Honorable Richard L. Voorhees, United States District
Judge, affirmed the order imposing sanctions against Watts-Robinson.
38.
Watts-Robinson was personally responsible for payment of the $2,500 sanction.
It was not Billips's responsibility.
39.
On or about 30 May 2012, Watts-Robinson issued check no. l321 for $2,500
drawn on her operating account as payment of the sanctions imposed by the District COUlt.
40.· On or about 7 May 20l3, Billips settled his employment discrimination matter
without a trial pursuant to terms set out in a written Settlement and Release Agreement.
41.
The terms of the settlement agreement provided, among other things, that three
payments would be made: (1) a $5,000 payment to Billips, less all applicable withholdings, (2) a
$96,011.92 payment to Billips, and (3) an $83,988.08 payment to Watts-Robinson as payment of
her attorney's fees.
On or about 29 May 20l3, Watts-Robinson received the following three checks in
42.
settlement of Billips's case: (1) a check made payable to Billips in the amount of $3,067.50; (2)
a check made payable to Billips in the amount of $96,011.92; and (3) a check made payable to
Law Offices of Lena Watts-Robinson, PAin the amount of $83,998.08.
43.
Watts-Robinson deposited the $83,998.08 check made payable to her into her
business operating account at or near the time that she received the check in May 2013.
44.
On or about 3 June 20l3, Watts-Robinson mailed the $3,067.50 check to Billips
under cover of letter that promised once she received the $96,011.92 check she would fOlward it
to Billips.
45.
Also on 3 June 20l3, Watts-Robinson returned to the defendant in the
employment discrimination case the $96,011.92 check payable to Billips under cover of letter
that requested that this check be reissued made payable to either: "Law Office of Lena WattsOrder of Discipline - 14 DHC 22
Page 4 of16

Robinson OR Louis Billips" or "Law Office of Lena Watts-Robinson on behalf of Louis
Billips."
46.
Watts-Robinson failed to inform Billips that she had received a check payable to
Billips for $96,011.92 and failed to inform him that he could either sign the check for deposit by
her into a Dust account or deposit the settlement check into his own bank account and be billed
separately for his litigation costs and expenses.
47.
Instead, Watts-Robinson infOimed Billips that the $96,011.92 check had been
issued incorrectly by the employer defendant as part of a scheme by the defendant to further
harass Billips.
48.
The defendant in Billips's case would not agree to reissue the check to WattsRobinson made payable to "Law Office of Lena Watts-Robinson OR Louis Billips." The
defendant would only agree to reissue it payable to "Law Office of Lena Watts-Robinson on
behalf of Louis Billips" if Billips executed an amended settlement agreement authorizing the
change.
49.
On or about 27 June 2013, Billips signed an amendment to the settlement
agreement of his employment discrimination case authorizing the settlement check to be reissued
made payable to "The Law Offices of Lena Watts-Robinson on behalf of Louis Billips."
Watts-Robinson received the $96,011.92 in trust for Billips on or about 21 July
50.
2013 during her representation of him.
51.
On or about 25 July 2013, Billips wrote to Watts-Robinson requesting that she
provide the remaining proceeds of his settlement and requesting that she provide a copy of his
file.
52.

Watts-Robinson did not respond to Billips's July 25 th request.

53.
Watts-Robinson deposited the reissued check for $96,001.92 and $10 in cash into
Wells Fargo 6677 on or about 26 July 2013.
54.
On or about 15 Augnst 2013, Billips filed a Petition for Resolution of Disputed
Fee with the State Bar, file no. 13FD0379, seeking the $96,011.92 check which constituted the
remainder of his settlement proceeds.
On 4 September 2013, Watts-Robinson signed the celtified mail receipt indicating
55.
her receipt ofthe Letter of Notice for 13FD0379.
56.
On or about 4 September 2013, the same date that Watts-Robinson acknowledged
receipt of the Letter of Notice for the Fee Dispute Petition, Watts-Robinson transferred
$9,493.84 to her operating account as reimbursement of purpOited expenses related to her
representation of Billips.
57.

Watts-Robinson did not inform Billips about the $9,493.84 disbursement.
Order of Discipline - 14 DHC 22
Page 5 of16

58.
Billips did not authorize Watts-Robinson to disburse any portion of the
$96,011.92 settlement proceeds to herself as payment of costs andlor expenses.
59.
Watts-Robinson included in the $9,493.84 disbursement to her herself purported
reimbursement for the $2,500 sanction she paid pursuant to Judge Keesler's order.
60.

The $2,500 sanction against Watts-Robinson was not an expense of Billips.

61.
Watts-Robinson was not entitled to use Billips's funds as reimbursement for her
payment of this sanction.
62.
Watts-Robinson knew that she was not entitled to transfer any portion of Billips's
funds to herself in purported reimbursement of the $2,500 sanction imposed against her.
63.

Watts-Robinson misappropriated $2,500 from Billips's settlement proceeds.

64.
Also included in the $9,493.84 amount Watts-Robinson transferred to herself was
a copy fee of $1,062.00 ($1.00 per page) that she assessed for providing Billips with a copy of
his client file.
65.
On 6 September 2013, the State Bar Fee Dispute Facilitator asked WattsRobinson to provide a copy of the executed contingent fee agreement, Billips's client ledger, the
settlement disbursement distribution summary sheet and a copy of the fully executed release.
66.
In subsequent communications between 6 September 2013 and 25 September
2013, the State Bar Fee Dispute Facilitator reiterated her requests for the contingent fee
agreement, client ledger and other documentation relating to Watts-Robinson's representation of
Billips and also asked Watts-Robinson to disburse the remainder of Billips's settlement proceeds
to him.
67.
On or about 14 September 2013, Watts-Robinson submitted her response to the
Letter of Notice for the fee dispute petition.
68.
Watts-Robinson failed to provide any substantive response to the petition, failed
to provide the documentation requested by the State Bar and also failed to provide any
information about the status ofthe remainder of Billips's settlement proceeds.
69.
Watts-Robinson failed to disburse any portion of Billips's $96,011.92 settlement
proceeds to Billips until she disbursed $86,508.08 to him by cashier's check on or about 24
September 2013.
Watts-Robinson did not inform Billips that she had disbursed $2,500 to herself in
70.
purported reimbursement of the sanctions imposed until she sent a "Statement of Costs and
Expenses" with the cashier's check she sent to Billips on or about 24 September 2013.
71.
Watts-Robinson stated the following on the Statement of Costs and Expenses in
support of the $2,500 "expense" she assessed to Billips: "paid to Benco Steel by order of the
Order of Discipline - 14 DHC 22
Page 6 of16

court because Billips' [sic1 left the deposition after Billips told his counsel that he felt
uncomfortable with Borders being present at Billips' [sic1deposition, prefelTed Judy White."
72.
Watts-Robinson's explanation of the $2,500 as listed on the statement of costs
that she provided to Billips was false and was intended to mislead Billips.
On or about 22 November 2013, the State Bar asked Watts-Robinson for a copy
73.
of the order imposing sanctions.
74.
In response to this request, Watts-Robinson failed to provide a copy of the Angust
2011 order that imposed the sanctions or the May 2012 order that affilmed the August 2011
order.
75.
Instead, Watts-Robinson provided the State Bar with a copy of an order granting
her motion for an extension of time to pay the sanction claiming that this order changed the
payer of the sanctions fi'om Watts-Robinson to Billips.
76.
Billips's funds earned approximately $13.00 of interest while Watts-Robinson
held them in Wells Fargo 6677.
77.

Watts-Robinson did not disburse this interest to Billips.

78.
Instead, Watts-Robinson appropriated the interest that accmed on Billips's
settlement proceeds to Watts-Robinson's benefit.
79.
In connection with her representation of Billips, Watts-Robinson collected a total
of $102,691.92: $93,198.08 in attorney's fees and $9,493.84 as reimbursement for purported
costs and expenses. This amount was $11,183.84 more than Billips received fi'om the case.
80.
Over the three years that Watts-Robinson represented Billips on an hourly basis,
she only perfOlmed 244.7 hours of work on his behalf (less than 9 weeks of work assuming she
worked a 30 hour work week).
81.
Watts-Robinson's fee of $93,198.08 for her representation of Billips
employment discrimination matter was excessive.

111

the

Burton Representation
82.
In or about the summer of 2012, N. Burton (hereafter "Burton") consulted with
Watts-Robinson about an unemployment appeal and Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission ("EEOC") Claim.
83.
On or about 29 June 2012, BUlion retained Watts-Robinson to represent her in the
unemployment appeal. Burton did not retain Watts-Robinson to represent her in the EEOC
claim.
84.
Watts-Robinson charged Burton a flat fee of $500 for representation in the
unemployment appeal.

85.
The hearing on Burton's unemployment appeal had already been scheduled for 10
July 2012 when Burton retained Watts-Robinson to represent her.
86.
Burton infonned Watts-Robinson of the scheduled hearing date at the time that
she retained Watts-Robinson.

continuance ofthe 10 July 2012 hearing.
88.
As of9 July 2012, Watts-Robinson had not received any response from the ESC
hearing officer as to whether her request to have BUlion's matter continued had been granted.
On 9 July 2012, Watts-Robinson left a message for Burton instructing BUlion to
89.
contact the heating officer to check on the status of Watts-Robins on's request for continuance.
90.
BUlion spoke with the heating officer on 10 July 2012. However, the hearing
officer would not provide Burton with any infonnation about the status of the continuance
request because Burton was represented by Watts-Robinson.
91.
The hearing officer told Burton that she would contact Watts-Robinson directly
about the matter.
The hearing officer contacted Watts-Robinson and infonned her that tlte heating
92.
had been continued. Watts-Robinson did not infonn BUlion about this communication.
93.
Between July 10 and July 13, Burton left several voicemail messages for WattsRobinson and sent several text messages to Watts-Robinson seeking to learn whether the hearing
on her unemployment appeal had been continued.

94.
whether the July 10tll hearing had been held or continued.
95.

conduct themselves ethically.

vital trust that clients and the public place in attorneys and the legal profession.

8.
The Hearing Panel has considered all lesser sanctions including: suspension,
censure, reprimand and admonition and finds that discipline less than disbarment would not
adequately protect the public fi-om Defendant's future misconduct for the following reasons:
a.

Defendant committed a criminal act, specifically embezzlement, that
reflects adversely on her honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer
in other respects and violated the trust of her client, Billips;

b.

entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the sellousness of the offenses Defendant committed and
would send the wrong message to lawyers and the public regarding the
conduct expected of members of the Bar ofthis State;

c.

the protection of the public and the legal profession requires that
Defendant not be permitted to return to the practice of law until she
demonstrates the following by clear, cogent and convincing evidence:
(i) that she has reformed, (ii) that she possesses the moral
qualifications required for admission to practice law in North Carolina,
taking into account the misconduct that is the subject of this order, (iii)
that she understands the current Rules of Professional Conduct,
including but not limited to those Rules relating to "Safekeeping
Propeliy" as set fOlih in Rule 1.15 et seq.; and (iv) that reinstatement
will not be detrimental to the public or the integrity and standing of the
legal profession. Disbarment is the only discipline that will require
Defendant to make such a showing before retnrning to the practice of
law.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Additional Findings of
Fact Regarding Discipline and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel
hereby enters the following:
