Based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, the hearing panel also finds by
clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
Defendant's conduct - to wit: widespread and severe neglect of client
matters, failure to adequately communicate with his clients, failure to resolve the matters
for which he was retained, failure to return unearned legal fees, and repeated
misrepresentations to his clients regarding the true status of his clients' legal matterscaused significant hann to his clients by impairing or extinguishing his clients' ability to
achieve the goals of the representation and by causing their loss of paid legal fees without
Defendant making any progress on their legal matters.
2.
Defendant's conduct not only hanned his clients' ability to resolve their
legal matters but also dcmonstrated an ongoing pattern of neglectful conduct, elevation of
Deflmdant's interests above those of his clients, and a dishonest or selfish motive in that
Defendant sought to gain, maintain, and benefit from his clients' confidence by making
false representations to them.
3.
Defendant's conduct demonstrates an intentional and sometimes impulsive
pattem of misrepresentations to his clients concerning the true status of their legal

16

matters, and Defendant never made any attempt to con'ect his misrepresentations.
Defendant's intentional misrepresentations resulted in foreseeable harnl to his clients and
reflect Defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness, or integrity.
4.
Defendant's conduct caused significant hann to the legal profession.
Defendant's neglect, failure to communicate with clients, failure to resolve the matters
for which he was retained, and repeated misrepresentations regarding the true status of
his clients' legal matters caused his clients, who were vulnerable because they were
unfamiliar with the legal process and relied upon Defendant to protect their legal rights,
to feel their trust had been betrayed. Nearly all of Defendant's fonner clients expressed a
sense of distrust of the legal profession in general due to Defendant's conduct.
5.
Defendant's habitual neglect of his clients' matters has the potential to
cause significant harm to the standing of the legal profession in the eyes ofthe public
because it shows his disregard for his duties as an attorney. Such erosion of public
confidence in attorneys tends to sully the reputation of, and fosters disrespect for, the
profession as a whole. Confidence in the legal profession is a building block for public
trust in the entire legal system.
6.
Defendant's conduct caused significant harm to the public and to the
administration ofjustice by unnecessarily delaying resolution of his clients' pending
cases and subjecting the cases to procedural resolution, rather than substantive or meritbased resolution. Justice is achieved when all matters subjected to litigation are resolved
on their merits and not as a result of procedural problems such as those created by
Defendant.
7.
Defendant's conduct caused significant harm to the public and to the
administration ofjustice by placing a significant and Uilllecessary burden on the
Haywood County Clerk of Court's office. Defendant's misrepresentations and client
neglect caused significant confusion and frustration amongst his clients, leading his
clients to inquire of and complain to the Clerk's office frequently over the course of at
least two years. As of the date ofthis hearing, the Clerk's office continues to receive
such inquiries and complaints.
8.
In addition to his failure to timely respond to inquiries from the State Bar
during the fee dispute and grievance processes, Defendant failed to appear at the hearing
in this matter and failed to appear for duly-noticed depositions of witnesses that took
place over two days in Defendant's home county. Defendant's conduct demonstrates a
continued refusal to participate in the self-regulation process and a refusal to
aclmowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct. Such conduct interferes with the State
Bar's ability to regulate its members and undernlines the profcssion's privilege to remain
self-regulating.
9.
In 2006, the North Carolina State Bar Grievance Committee issued an
admonition to Defendant for failing to adequately communicate with a client.

17

10.
Defendant is a danger to the public due to his continued neglect of client
matters, repeated and intentional misrepresentations, and ongoing refusal to participate in
the self-regulation process. Defendant's inability or unwillingness to comply with the
Rules of Professional Conduct requires this panel to impose discipline upon Defendant as
the only means to adequately acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct and protect
the public.
Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel enters the following
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the different fonns of
discipline available to it. In addition, the hearing panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB Â§ .Oll4(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and detennines the following factors are applicable:
a. Defendant's prior disciplinary offense;
b. A dishonest or selfish motive on Defendant's part;
c. Defendant's pattem of misconduct;
d. Defendant engaged in multiple offenses;
e. Defendant's refusal to aclmowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct;
f.

The vulnerability of the victims; and

g. Defendant's substantial experience in the practice oflaw.
2.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. IB Â§ .OI14(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and detennines Defendant has engaged in the following conduct that compel
consideration of and warrants disbannent:
a. Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication; and
b. Impulsive acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication
without timely remedial efforts.
3.
The hearing panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. IB Â§ .OI14(w)(l) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar
and detennines the following factors have been established and warrant disbannent:
a. Defendant's intent to commit acts where the hann or potential hann was
foreseeable;

18

b. Circumstances reflecting Defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness, or
integrity;
c. Elevation of Defendant's own interests above that of his clients;
d. Defendant's conduct had a negative impact on his clients' and the public's
perception of the legal profession;
e. Defendant's conduct had a negative impact on the administration of
justice;
f.

Defendant's conduct impaired each client's ability to achieve the goals of
the representation;

g. Defendant's conduct had a negative effect on third pmiies; and
h. Defendant's conduct consisted of acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation,
deceit, and fabrication.
4.
The hearing panel has considered all other fonns of discipline and
concludes that any sanction less than disbannent would fail to acknowledge the
seriousness of the offenses committed by Defendant, would not adequately protect the
public, and would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the
conduct expected of members ofthe Bar.
5.
Due to the nature and extent of Defendant' s conduct, the significant harm
caused by Defendant's conduct, and the significant potential hann caused by Defendant's
conduct, and in the interest of protecting clients, the public, the administration ofjustice,
and the profession, this panel finds and concludes that disbannent is the only discipline
that will adequately protect clients, the public, the administration of justice, and the
profession from future transgressions by Defendant.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Findings
Regarding Discipline and Conclusions Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel enters the
following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1.
Defendant, Mark L. Jenkins, is hereby DISBARRED from the practice of
law in North Carolina.

Jenkins shall submitted his license and membership card to the Secretary
of the North Carolina State Bar no later than thirty (30) days following the date that this
Order is served upon him. Jenkins shall comply with the wind down provisions

located at 27 N.C.A.C. IB Â§ .0124.

MARK 1. JENKINS, Attorney,
Defendant

NOW COMES the hearing panel of the Disciplinary Hearing Commission
composed of M. H. Hood Ellis, Chair, Theodore C. Edwards, II and Karen B. Ray
assigned in this matter on its own motion and notes that after the 31 March 2011 hearing
and decision of the hearing panel but before the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law,
and Order of Discipline had been reduced to writing and entered, the hearing panel
received the sad news that Defendant Mark 1. Jenkins had passed away. Because Mark
1. Jenkins is now deceased, the discipline imposed by the Order of Discipline is moot
and accordingly, this proceeding should be and is hereby abated. With appropriate
consideration for the family of Mark L Jenkins, Plaintiff may, in its discretion, pursue
any legal remedies to recover the costs ofthis proceeding against Defendant's estate.
Signed by the Chair with the consent of the other hearing panel members this the
Iz.M day of April, 201 I.
