AFFIDAVII TENDER
NDER OF THE LICENSE OF
FLETCHER L. HARTSELL, JR.
I, Fletcher L. Hartsell, Jr., being first duly sworn, say:
I.

I desire to resign and hereby tender my license to practice law in North Carolina
pursuant to the provisions of Section .0121 of the North Carolina State Bar Discipline
and Disability Rules, 27 N .C. Admin. Code, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Section .0121.

2.

My resignation is freely and volUlltarily rendered. It is not the result of coercion or
duress. I am fully aware of the implication of submitting my resignation.

3.

I am aware that there is presently pending an investigation including allegations that I
engaged in certain federal and state felony criminal offenses to which I have pled
guilty, to wit: (1) mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.c. §§ 1341 and 1342 as charged
in Count Six of the Superseding Indictment filed in the United States District Court
for the Middle District of North Carolina, Docket Number 1:16CR344-1; (2) filing
false tax returns for the year 2010 in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7206(1) as charged in
Counts One and Two of the Indictment filed in the United States District Court for
the Middle District of North Carolina, Docket Number 1: 16CR392-1; (3) certifying
and filing false campaign reports with the North Carolina State Board of Elections in
violation of N .C. Gen. Stat. § 163-278.32 as charged in the Indictment filed in the
General Court of Justice, Superior Court, Wake County, North Carolina, docket
number 16CRS2857.

4.

I pled guilty to the federal charges identified above on February 17,2017 and to the
state charges identified above on May 19, 2017. I acknowledge that under 27 N.C.
Admin. Code IB.0119 the material facts upon which the conviction is based and the
grievance is predicated are deemed conclusively established, and acknowledge that
they are true.

5.

My resignation is being submitted because I know that if disciplinary charges were
predicated upon the criminal charges to which I pled guilty I could not successfully
defend against them.

6.

I understand that the hearing by the Council of the North Carolina State Bar with
regard to the acceptance of the tender of surrender of my license to practice law will
occur at the regularly scheduled meeting of the Council of the North Carolina State
Bar on Friday, October 26,2018 at the North Carolina State Bar building in Raleigh,
North Carolina.
