Southerland that he represented Cuffee.
.

I

settlement check and a $1,000.00 med-pay check from Integon into his trust account.

Integon.
~

I

22. On February 14, 2002, Southerland wrote trust account check number 1556 to
Roberts for $2,482.00. Tbat amount represented the difference between the $10,232.00 the
McEachin estate h~d paid Southerland as a fee for the Integon settlement and the $7,750.00 fee
Southerland's contract actually called for. Southerland's check number 1556 was negotiated and
paidbut was not deposited into the McEachin estate's account.
23. On March 22, 2002, Southerland forwarded McEachin estate check number 589 in

other estate account checks to demonstrate that the $10,529.60 Was the net amount ofthe
$31,000.00 liability and tried-pay settlement with Integon. Although Southerland's transmittal
letter advisedlthe Virginia attorney that the copied checks reflected the bills that the e$tatehad
paid, Southerland failed tp advise the Virginia attorney that he had made a refund to· Roberts for
$2,482.00 of the fee the estate had paid to him. Southerland also failed to advise the Virginia
attorney that he had previously settled the Farm BureaU underinsured claim or that an .
underinsured claim was pending with State Fann Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(hereinafter, State Farm),
24. By failing to disclose the receipt of the Farm Bureau settlement and by
misrepresenting the actual fee that the McEachin estate had paid to .him from the Integon

I

...

settlement, Southerland intentionally misrepresented the McEachin estate's receipts and
disbursements to the Virginia attorney for Cuffee.
25. On April 16, 2002; Southerland wrote trust account check number 1663 to himself
for $6,000.00. Southerland wrote o~ the face,ofiliat check that the disbursement was made on
behalf of James Leach, a client and business associate who had no funds on deposit in
Southerland's trust account on that date. Southerland later changed the designation on the check
to show th~t $2,340.00 of check number 1663 was for a client named Boone and $3,660.00 of
that check was for McEachin.
I

'

26; At the tinte that Southerland wrote trust accOuilt check uumber 1663 to himself and
charged it ,as a McEachin disbursement, the most that Southerland could claim that the
McEachin! estate owed him in fees was $1,060.00. Also, Southerland only had $360.00 of the
McEachin estate's funds remaining in his trust account when he wrote trust account check
number 1663.

I

27! By taking $3,660.00 from his trust account as a fee' for representing McEachin after
Southerla*d had been paid all but $1,0600.00 of his fee and when. the McEachin estate had no
more than $360.00 remaining in Southerlap.d's trust account, Southerland appropriated entrusted
funds he sp.ould have held in a fiduciary capacitY for the McEachin estate and other clients'
entrusted funds to his own uSe.
.
28~ On April 17, 2002, Southerland wrote trust account check number 1681 to hims~lf

for $200.00 that he charged to the McEachin estate. Because the McEachin estate had no more
.funds on deposit
in Southerland's
trust account,
Southerland appropriated entrusted funds he
I
.
'
should haye held in a fiduciary capacity for other clients to his oWn use to pay this check.
29,. On June 4, 2002; Judge B. Craig Ellis entered another order relating to the settlement
of McEachin's wrongful death claim. This order acknowledged the previous settlement of the
and authorized settlement of a $70,000.00
underinsured claim being paid by State

I "
,
Farm. In paragraph 5 of that order, Judge Ellis ordered the administrator, Roberts, to use the
entire $100,000.00 of liability and underinsured coverage to satisfy funeral and burial expenses,
medical e~penses and other costs of administration, and ordered the aclnJ.inistrator to hold the
baJance f6r the use and benefit of the heir of the estate.

BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the evidence
, presented at the hearing and the arguments of counsel, the hearing committee hereby mak~s the
following:
'
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARblNG DISCIPLINE
1. SOlltherland's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:

(a)

dishonest or selfish motive;

(b)

a pattern of misconduct;

(c)

multiple offenses;

(d)

refusal to aCknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct;

(e)

the vulnerability of his victims; and

(f)

indifference to making restitution.

I
"

.

----.--------,-----------------------------------

- - -----

2. Southerland's misconduct is mitigated by the following factors:
(a)

absence of a prior disciplinary record;

(b)

evidence of good character and reputation in his community.

3. :The ~act that no particular client complained about Southerland and the fact
that no trUst account check was returned for insufficient funds were neithe,rmitigating
factors not defenses in this matter.
4. The aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors.

I

5. The State Bar's auditor, Bruno E. DeMolli, conducted a procedural audit of
Southerland's trust account in July 2001 that disclosed that Southerland had cOlll111ingled
his fees with his clients' :t1.llds in the trust account and had failed to promptly disburse
funds for his clients. On August 27,2001, Southerland wrqte to Mr. DeMolli listing
corrective! measures that he had taken to correct these deficiencies. Yet, the evidence
presented,in this case shows that Southerland continued to ignore the requirements of the
Revised Rules of Professional Conduct in the handling of his clients' funds.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE
An order calling for any discipline short of disbarment would not sufficiently
protect the public for the following reasons:
I

•

(a)
An attorney's duty to preserve a client's funds entrusted to the attorney is
one of the most sacred duties that an attorney undertakes. An attorney should never
vi9late that duty or the trust the client has in the attorney to honor that duty.
I

(b)
On several different occasions and in numerous respects, Southerland
violated that duty and his clients' trust. In doing so, Southerland caused significant harm )
to his clients. It is particularly troubling that minor children were victims of
Southerland's misconduct.

1-.

(c)
Southerland's failure to truthfully communicate to the Cuffee's Virginia
attorney concerfiirIg the refund of a portion of his fee and settlement of the underinsured
c1~ims violated the trust and honesty that all officers of the court owe to each other,
causing significant harm to our system of jurisprudence.
(d)
Southerland's violation of his duty to preserve his clients' entrusted funds
and his violation of the duty of honesty that all officers of the court oWe to each other
caused significant harm to the legal profession.
(e)
Several of the medical providers in the McNeill cases were not paid a
penny out of the funds that Southerland was ordered by the court to pay, causing
significant harm to members of the public in Southerland's community.

1

I"

Southerland engaged in multiple violations of the Revised Rules of
Professional Conduct in the handling of clients' funds after he advised the State Bar's
auditor that he had taken measures to correct the deficiencies that the auditor had
uncovered. The hearing committee concludes that there is substantial risk to the public
that Southerland would continue to engage in misconduct if allow~d to continue to
practice law.
(f)

I

.
(g)
Entry of an order imposing lesser discipline would fail to ackp.owledge the
seriousness of the offenses that Southerl~d committed and would send the wrong
message to attorneys and the public regarding the ·conduct expected of members of the
Bar in this State.
(h)
The protection of the public requires that Southerland not be permitted to '
resume the practice of law until he demonstrates that he has reformed, that he
understands his obligations to his clients and that reinstatement would not injure the
standing of the legal profession. Disbarred attorneys must show reformation, among
other things, before they resume the practiceoflaw, whereas no such showing of ",
reformation is required of an attorney whose license is merely suspended for a term
certain.
BASED UPON the foregoing Findings ot'FactRegardihg Discipline and the arguments
of counsel, the hearing committee hereby enters the following:
ORDER OF DISCiPLINE
1. The Defendant, Harry L. Southerland, is hereby DISBARRED.
