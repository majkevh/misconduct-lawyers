client, the administration of justice, the profession or a member

"~- In April 1992 you undertook to represent John Lichtenberger
riegarding a DWI cl).arge then pending against him.
~ichtenberger
was convicted, and you filed notice of appeal on his behalf to
superior cou~t. -In October 1992, the conviction was remanded-to
distric~ cou~t.
About this same time, you made some efforts to
obtain a limi,t.ed driving privilege for Lichtenberger, but had not
completed that task, when, on Oct. 18, 1992, Lichtenberger was- charged with driving while his license was revoked.

I

On Dec. ~, 1992, you approacihed Judge William B. Reingol~:
and asked him to· sigh a limited driving privilege for
Lichtenberger. Afte~ having the privilege signed, but before you
filed it, you discovered that Lichtenberger had been convicted of
a second D~I offense, sometime after Oct. 20, 1992. YoU
recognized that, under the circumstances, Lichtenb~rger was not
entitled to a limited driving privilege and that the document
_.signed by Jud~e _Reingold was not valid.
Nevertheless, you caused the legend "certified to be a true
.copy of the original" to be typed on the privilege. and signed it.
You then forwarded it to Lichtenberger, even though you knew the
- document was not valid and that your client might use -it.
~f Fortunately, ~s it qeveloped, there is no evidence that
'.>J..ichtenberger·. used the privilege in any way .
...,..

:'-. By signing an order which you knew was invalid and by
forw'arding it' to your client, you engaged in conduct involving
fraud, deceit'andidishonesty in violation of Rule 1.2(C) of the
:auies of ProfE;:ssional Conduct and also engaged in conduct
prejudicial to the administration of justice, in violation of
Rule 1.2(.0) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Yourmisconduc.t is. aggravated by the fact that you were reprimanded
for unrelated'misconduct in April 1992 and that you were censured
in April 1993: for s-till other misconduct.-

I

I

You' are hereby censured by the North Carolina State Bar for
your violatio~ of~the Rules of Professional Conduct. The
Grievance Committee trusts that you will ponder this censure,
recognize the:error that you have made, and that you will -never
again allow yourself to depart from adherence to the highethica~
standa+qs of ~he legal profession. This censure should serVe as
a strong reminder ·:and inducement fo+ you to weigh careful-ly in
the future your responsibility to the public, your-clients, your
. fellow attorn~ys and the courts, to the end that you demean
yourself as a :respected member of the legal profession whose
90nduct may b~ relied upon without question .
