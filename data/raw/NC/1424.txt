t

In May, 1982, the Defendant was ,employed by Jo~ia.llMercier,

executor of the estate of Oscar Mer¢er, to represent him .
concerning the .administration of said estate in Cumberland '
County. No fee or means for' deterrhining a fee for iegalservtces
was agr~ed upon at the time of employment.
',
'
An, estate checking account was established shortly t,hereaft~r at

United Carolina Bank (account .no. 50-5~1-330-3) in F8y$tte,vi1.1e'
op which both Josiah M~rcer and the Defendant had signatory
authority. The Defendant retained custody of the 'estate .
c.h~ckbopk with the pernu.s~ion of the personal repr~sentative and
wrote all estate' checks. The total value of' the' estate was less
than $20, 000 •
'.
"
.
Dur~' the ,course of the aOministration the Defendant nandled a~l
routin~ estate affairs and' represented the estate :t;il:,a 'C<;)ntested:

caveat proceeding,. The ,Defendant per-fomeq, stibst~t:tal l~gal '
services 'for the estate. Between May 25" 1983 ,and, Septemoer23,
1983, the Defendant wrote six' (6) estate cliecks, pay~ble to
herself and to cash totalling '$5,500.00. Thr~e of :t;hel?e checkf;l
totalling,$3.,750.00 were designated as legal fees and all were· .
intended as iegal fees. The Defendant:riegotiated the chec}tsand
used t,he funds obtained for personal purposes. Th~ Pefendant
claims she diq" not realize at the 'time she wrote ,estate ,chec):<:$"
for cash that such was inappro~riate.

Prior to writing the checks referred to in paragraph ,6 above, the,'
Pefendant did not consUlt with the per$onal r$pres!3ntati\Te,ot" the
Clerk of Supe~iorCour,t as to the t~ or amount of the,
payments de~cribed above.. They were made without ,regard tatltme
spent 0r work~ccanp11shed in the :totaldlscr~tioIi qf the , .
Defendant. No legal fees paid QY the PefendBnt. to' herselfha,ve
ev~r been appro\Ted by the Clerk of Superior Court.,.

The Defendant k~pt no records of 'her handling of the eetate fund~ , '
othertharl check stubs', several of which contafnedno descr1pt:J.on
of how estate ftmds were used. The Defendant hadp~ st~tements
and cancelled checks maileq directly to the perso~l,
representa..tiv~.

On or about September 4, 1984, the Defendant prepared and 'filed
final account in the estate of Oscar iMercer in the office ,c;f the
Clerk of S~perior Court. This f:irtai account, whiCh was' signed .
and approved by' the personal. representative, showed tnat the
D~fendant had received only $4,100.00 from the estate inleg~
fees, approxiInately $1,400.00 les~ than she had actilally ... ' . ,
recej"ved. TPe Defendant knew at the time she pr~sented tne final'
account that it did not acc~rately state the tota;t a,rootmtof fees
she had paid herself. The final account wasnQt approved :qy t:q:e .

10e On or about May 10, 1983, Ev~ Walker, adnrl.nistratrix of the
estate of Ishmael Walker, retained the D~fendant to assist her
concerning the administration of said estate in CUmberland
County. A fee for this service of $700. cDO was agreed upon and
the Defendant was, paid $160.00 by Eva Wa+ker at the time of
employment"

II .. An estate checking account was established shortly thereafter at
First Citizens Bank and Trust Company (account no .. 034-73-44-404)
in Fayetteville on which both the administratrix and the
Defendant had sigpatory authoritYe The Defendant retained
custody of the estate checkbook with the permission of the
administratrix and wrote all estate checks.
I

12. During the course: of the administration the Defendant handled all
routine estate affairs. Between' June 22, 1983, ahd August 10,
1983, th$ Defendant wrote seven (7) estate checks payable to
herself and to cash totalling $1.,820.00. Five of
'
these checks totalling $1,700.00 were designated as legal fees
and ali were intended as legal feese Th~ Defendant negotiated
the checks and used the funds obtained fqr personal 'purposes.
'The Defendant claims that checks represe~ting the difference
between the amount she actually paid herself and the contract fee
were inadvertently written on the Walker account instead of the
Mercer account. According to the Defendant, the checkbooks for
the two estates wer.e very similar in appearance and kept in the
same drawer in her office. The Defendant has fully refunded to
the Walker ~state, all funds paid to per ~ legal fees in excess
of the $700 contract fee. The Defendant claj.ms that at the time
she wrote estate ohecks for cash she did not realize that such
was inappropriate'e

I

13. Prior to writing the checks referred to in paragr.aph 12 above,
the Pefendant did, not consult with the administratrix or the
Cle'rk of Superior Court as to the timing or $Ilourit of the
payments described above. They were made without regard to time
spent or work accbmplished in the total discretion of the
Defendant. Neith$r the ~dministratrix hor the Clerk of Superior
Cot,Wt ever ~uthor:tzed a fee in e~cess of '$700.00.
14. The Defendant kept no reeords of her handling of the estate funds
other than check stubs. The Defendant had bank statements and
cancelled checks mailed directly to the administratrix. After
disbursement of all funds in the estate account, the Defendant
destroyed the cheykbook, including all checkstubs, for the
professed purpose of insuring that unused checks would not be
misused.
'
150 The Defendant received a,private reprimarid from the Grievance
Committee in 1984: for failing to deposit ,client funds in a trust
account and for failing to pay client funds promptly as directed
in 1981 ..
Based upon the foregoing FINDINGS OF FACT the parties stipulate the
following CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:
