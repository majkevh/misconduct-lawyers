taking place on 25 June 2012.

matter for which he was retained, and by failing to inform A.D. of his
inability to continue the representation, Defendant failed to act with
reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client in violation of

failed to take reasonably practicable steps upon termination of representation
to protect a client's interests in violation of Rule 1.l6(d);

(u)

By failing to inform A.D. that her hearing date had not been continued, by
failing to inform A.D. of his inability to practice law, and by otherwise
failing to respond to A.D.' s requests for information, Defendant failed to
reasonably consult with his client about the means by which the client's
objectives were to be accomplished in violation of Rule 1.4(a)(2), failed to
keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter in violation
of Rule 1.4(a)(3), and failed to promptly comply with reasonable requests for

(v)

By failing to respond to the Letter of Notice in grievance file no. 14G0731,
Defendant knowingly failed to respond to a lawful demand for information
from a disciplinary authority in violation of Rule 8. 1(b).

Based upon the consent of the parties, the hearing panel also finds by clear, cogent,
and convincing evidence the following
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
During the relevant periods herein, Defendant suffered from depression and
anxiety, which significantly contributed to Defendant's neglect and failure to timely or
appropriately respond to his clients. In light of these conditions, in May 2014, Defendant
consented to winding down his practice and being transferred to inactive status with the State
Bar by Order of the Mecklenburg County Superior Court. In 2015, Defendant was evaluated
by a licensed psychologist who opined that Defendant is not currently disabled from the
practice of law as defined by the State Bar's administrative rules (located at 27 N.C. Admin.
Code 1B ยง .0103(19)). Defendant was subsequently transferred back to active status with the
State Bar in September 2015 by the Mecklenburg County Superior Court. Although
Defendant is not presently suffering from any disability that would prevent him from
practicing law, Defendant has not resumed his practice due to his mental condition that could
potentially harm his clients and that could interfere with his ability to practice law in
accordance with the Rules of Professional Conduct should he resume his practice.

2.
Defendant's conduct, to wit: severe and widespread neglect of client matters,
failure to communicate with clients, and failure to complete the matters for which he was
retained caused significant harm to his clients and their abilities to resolve their legal matters.
Defendant's conduct caused significant confusion and frustration among his clients, and in
some instances resulted in the court issuing orders for his clients' arrest. Defendant's conduct
also impaired his clients' abilities to achieve the goals of their respective representations by
causing unnecessary delay in their cases.
3.
Defendant's clients were vulnerable victims of his misconduct. His clients
were unfamiliar with the legal process and had limited financial resources. His clients had
paid and relied upon Defendant to protect or pursue their legal rights.
4.
Defendant's conduct caused significant harm to the public and to the
administration of justice by unnecessarily delaying resolution of his clients' cases. Justice is
achieved when all matters are timely pursued and resolved; justice is impeded by attorneys
who knowingly abandon their clients and their duties as an attorney, leaving their clients'
cases and their clients' interests in an unnecessarily uncertain status such as that created by
Defendant.
5.
Defendant caused significant harm to the profession by repeatedly failing to
respond to multiple State Bar inquires and otherwise failing to participate in the grievance
process. Such conduct interferes with the State Bar's ability to regulate its members and
undermines the profession's privilege to remain self-regulating.
6.
By engaging in repeated instances of client neglect and failure to respond to
the Bar, Defendant committed multiple offenses and displayed a pattern of misconduct. At
the time of his conduct, Defendant knew or should have knowo that his actions could harm his
clients and the administration of justice.
7.
Defendant's conduct caused potential significant harm to the standing of the
legal profession in the eyes of the public in that such conduct by attorneys erodes the trust of
the public in the profession. Confidence in the legal profession is a building block for public
trust in the entire legal system.
8.
There is an absence of any evidence that Defendant intended to harm his
clients or that he exhibited a dishonest or selfish motive.
9.

Defendant has no prior discipline.

10.
Defendant has acknowledged his conduct violated the Rules of Professional
Conduct and is remorseful for his actions.
Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel also enters the following

1.1

CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the hearing panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin. Code 1B ยง .0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the
North Carolina State Bar and detennines the following factors are applicable:
a. Defendant's lack of prior disciplinary offenses;
b. Defendant's lack of a selfish or dishonest motive;
c. Defendant's pattern of misconduct;
d. Defendant's multiple offenses;
e. The effect of Defendant's personal or emotional problems on the conduct in
question;
f.

Defendant's remorse; and

g. The vulnerability of the victims, Defendant's clients.
2.
The hearing panel concludes that none of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.
Admin. Code 1B ยง .0114(w)(2) ofthe Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar
are present in this case.
3.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C. Admin. Code 1B ยง .0114(w)(1) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and determines the following factors warrant suspension of Defendant's license:
a. Defendant's intent to commit acts where the harm or potential harm was
foreseeable;
b. Defendant's actions potentially had a negative impact on his clients' and the
public's perception of the legal profession;
c. Defendant's actions had a negative impact on the administration of justice;
d. Defendant's conduct impaired his clients' abilities to achieve the goals of the
representation; and
e. Defendant's multiple instances of failure to participate in the legal profession's
self-regulation process.
4.
The hearing panel has considered all other forms of discipline and concludes
that any sanction less than suspension would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the
offenses committed by Defendant, would not adequately protect the public, and would send
the wrong message to attorneys and to the public regarding the conduct expected of members
of the Bar.
1~

5.
The hearing panel further concludes that due to the extensive client neglect
described in the present action, the public will only be adequately protected by imposing a
period of active suspension of Defendant's law license. Additionally, the hearing panel
concludes that Defendant should be allowed the opportunity to petition for a stay of a portion
ofthe suspension imposed by this Order upon compliance with certain conditions designed to
ensure protection of the public and Defendant's compliance with the Rules of Professional
Conduct.
6.
Under other circumstances, the misconduct in this case would warrant more
serious discipline as set forth in the additional findings above. However, the unique
circumstances surrounding this case justifY lesser discipline than would otherwise be
appropriate. The factors that particularly warrant lesser discipline include: Defendant's
depression and anxiety significantly contributed to Defendant's misconduct; Defendant has
accepted personal responsibility for his actions; Defendant acknowledges the wrongfulness
and seriousness of his misconduct; and Defendant is genuinely remorseful.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Findings
Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel enters the following
