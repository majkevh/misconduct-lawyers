3. Theorqet of the Colorado Supreme Court found that Sigley had failedto
deliyer to a client th¢ il1terest e~ed on the client's funds, which were being held in an

In people v. Farrant, 852 P.2d 4'52, 454 (Colo. 19$13), the
lawyer v.i,olated DR 7-105(A}, the precursor to Colo. RPC 4.5,1 by
threatE?ning to present criminal charges solely to obtain an
advantage in a civil matter.

I

We said that

the respondent's threat to reveal ~lient
donfidences or secrets and to thereby cause
criminal proceedings to be initiated against
hiS client if his fee was not paid would
itself justify suspension. See ABA Standards
1 : The prohibition of DR 7-10\5 (A) was deliberately omi tt:ed
from tqe ABA Model Rules beca1,lse it was thought tOQ broaO).y
wordeci'and because other provisici"ns of the Model Rules would
effect:lve:j.y regulate extortionCite behavior. See ABA/BNA ~aWyers'
Mariualon Professional Conpuct § 71:603 (1994); see also In re .
Yarborough; 488 S.E.2d 871, 874 n.5 (S.C. 1997). By continuing
DR 7~105(A)'s pr~hibition on thr~atehing or presenting dr~minal
charges, to obtain an advantage in a c;ivtl 1'[]:q.tte~ throl.lgh ~doption,

We note that the respondent has been previously

disdiplitJ.~d~

which is an aggravating factor for determining the proper
sanction.

See ABA Standards 9.22(a).

He has received rour

letters ·of admonition, two in 1993, one in 1994, and one in 1996.
We suspended tpe respondent in JUne 1996 for th,irtyq,ays for.
failing to return the unused port;lon of a client' $ advance f·ee,
failing to disclose a conflict of .interest in another matter.; and
for pursuing an invalid reaffi.rmation agreement in an action
against a ciient.

See People v .. SJgley, 91'1 P.2ci 1253, 125'6

(Colo. 19'96).
In mitigCition, the' complainant states that tpe respondent
has not sought to be reinstated from the' 1996 suspension· because
these proceedings were pending.

I

See ABA 'Standaro.s

~.32(k)

(impos.i tion ofo,ther penalties or sanctions is a fni tig.ating

Taking all of the foregoing factors into account, we
conclUde that an additional suspension for thirty d~ys with tbe
requirement of reinstatement proceedings is an adequate sanction!
