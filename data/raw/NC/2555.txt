REPRIMAND

On january 19, 2006 the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar ,met ancJ
considered t~e grievances filed against you by T. B.
Pursuanito Section.()1 f3(a) of the DisCipline and DisabIlity RUles oft:he North CarolinaState Bar, the Grievance Committee conducted a preliminary h~aring. After considering the
inf9rmation available to it, including your re~p0nse to the l~tter of notice, the Grievance
Committee found probable cause. Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable cause to
believe that a member of the North Carolina State Bar is guilty of:rniscortdttctjustifying
disciplinary action."

I

The rules ptovide that after a finding of probable ca':lse, the Grievance Committee may
determine that the filing of a complaint and a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission are not required, and the Grievance Committee may issl,le various levels of
discipline depending upon the misconduct, the actual or potential injury cause4; and any
aggravating or mitigating factors. The Grievance Committee may issue an adp:lonjtiQn,a
reprimand, or a censure to the respondent attorney.
' "
A reprimand is a written form of discipline more serious than an admortitiol1 issued in
cases in which an attorney,has violated orie or more provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct and,has.causecLhan:ll-Ot-PotentiaLharm to a client,Jhe administratibn-Ofj.ustice, the
profession, or a member of the public, but the misconduct does not require a censure.
The Grievance Committee was of the opinion that a censure is not required in this case
and issues this reprimand to you. As chairman of the Grievarice Committ~e of the North
Carolina State Bar, it is nqw my duty to issue this reprimanq.
Prior to June 2001 you represented T. B. on an appeal of his criminal conviction. After
the Court of Appeals ruled on the appeal, Mr. B. requested'that you send him a copy of his
transcript and his file so he could further pursue his' case. Mr. B. maintains that Y0l,l di<i not
provide the transcript or file to -him or his foster mother who contacted you on his behalf, even
after you were contacted several times by a representative of the North Carolina State Bar Client

Assistance Program. Mr. B. filed a grievance against you and the State Bar sent you a Letter of
Notice. Fo119wing your response to the Letter of Notice, counsel for the State Bar sent you a
letter asking fOr additional information. You did not respond to the bar counsel and you did not
provide evid\fnce or information tending to show that you actually provided a copy of his
transcript or file to Mr, B.
" The Grievance Committee determined these actions were in violation of Rule 1.16(d) and
Ruie 8.1 (b). In issuing this Reprimand, the Grievance Committee con~idered prior discipline you
received for instances of failing to promptly respond to the Bar

Carolina State Bar regarding the taxing of the adniinistrative and investigative costs to any
attorney issued a reprimand by the Grievance Committee, the costs of this "action in the amount
-of-$50:00are hereby taxed"toyou.
