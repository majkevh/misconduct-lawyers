REPORT OF THE ETHICS COMMITTEE BY W. P. SANDRIDGE, CHAIRMAN

I

Mr. Sandridge reported that the following inquiries were considered by the Ethics Committee
and that.the Committee recommended the adoption of the foliowing Opinions and Decisions:

The

Counci,l adopted the following Opinions and Decisions:
CPR 58
(October 16, 1975)
Inquiry: +s it etqical for a lawyer to write and publish a pamphlet on a legal topic of
interest and o~fer tpe pamphlet for sale to the public either und~r the author's, own name or under
a periname?
. Opinion: The writing of legal testbooKs, treatises and other legal publicati,ons by a lawyer
and digni,fied advertisements of such publications are express~y permitted by DR2~lOl(B)(5). It is
obvious that the authorsfiip and sale of such pamphlet to the general public may be, abused. Th~
author should be careful to arrange the distribution so a~ to avoid ev~n th~ appearance of solicitation of professional work. The name of the author should be accompanied only 'by .the statement
that he is a member of the Bar of his city. See Opinion No. 845.
