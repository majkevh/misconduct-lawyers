Based upon the foregoing facts and conclusions of law, and upon the evidence
and arguments presented at the hearing concerning appropriate discipline, the Hearing
Panel hereby finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following
ADDmONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
Defendant, who was licensed to practice law in North Carolina in 1993,
has substantial experience in the practice oflaw.
2.
Defendant received an Admonition in 2003 and a Reprimand in 2004;
both matters concerned Defendant's mishandling of real estate closings.
3.
Defendant knowingly provided legal services via out-of-state entities
without speaking with the North Carolina clients he was allegedly serving. Represented
clients can only effectively participate in our system of justice if they have the
7

opportunity to communicate with the attorney representing them. An attorney can only
effectively represent a client if he has communicated with the client sufficiently to
understand the client's circumstances as well as the client's goals in the representation.
The hann and potential hann resulting from Defendant's failure to communicate with his
clients was entirely foreseeable.
4.
Defendant should have taken a number of steps to ensure his clients were
protected and that his conduct conformed with the Rules of Professional Conduct,
including contacting the North Carolina clients of these out-of-state entities and taking
steps to ensure that he was meeting each client's needs.
5.
Rather than investigate these entities before agreeing to serve as their local
attorney to detennine whether they were authorized to practice law in North Carolina,
Defendant accepted quick money for minimal work and did not take steps to protect his
clients' interests, thereby elevating his own interests above those of his clients.
6.
Defendant's conduct - aiding nonattomeys in providing legal services in
this state, neglecting his clients, failing to communicate with clients, drafting and cansing
to be filed ineffectual and deficient documents - caused significant hann to his clients
and their abilities to achieve the goals of the representation.
7.
Defendant's conduct caused significant harm to his clients and the
administration of justice by causing unnecessary delay in his clients' cases.
8.
Defendant's conduct caused signifioant hann to his clients by depriving
them of their limited financial resources available for legal representation without
providing them adequate legal services in return.
9.
Defendant's clients were vulnerable victims of bis misconduct.
Defendant's association with the out-of-state entities lent legitimacy to the entities and
their unauthorized practice of law. To their unknowing detriment, Defendant's clients
trusted the entities and their ability to offer legal assistance due - at least in part - to
Defendant's association with the entities. His clients included individuais going through
divorces, child custody disputes, and bankruptcy; for example, K.B. was fighting to keep
her home from foreclosure in an effort to keep her family together. His clients were
unfamiliar with the legal process and had limited financial resources. His clients had
paid and relied upon Defendant to protect or pursue their legal rights and yet were often
left in a worse position after Defendant's involvement.
10.
Defendant's conduct also had a negative impact on third parties.
Defendant's conduct before the Bankruptcy Court contributed to one client losing her
home, wherein multiple members of the client's family were living; the family has since
been broken up and forced to live in multiple locations. The legal documents Defendant
drafted through Family Court Direct were ineffectual and, as a result, not only negatively
affected the clients, but negatively affected the clients' family members - e.g., the
children over whom the client was seeking custody - as well.

8

11.
Defendant's actions of drafting and causing to be filed legal documents
with numerous errors in them, such that Defendant was called into court, failed to appear
in court, and subsequently was fined and disbarred by the court, had a negative impact
on the administration of justice. Moreover, Defendant's actions of drafting legal
documents through Family Court Direct, such that they were rejected by the courts and
had to be redrafted, negatively affected the administration of justice. Justice is achieved
when all matters are timely pursued and resolved; justice is impeded by attorneys who
abdicate their duties as an attorney, leaving their clients' cases and their clients' interests
in an unnecessarily nncertain status such as that created by Defendant.
12.
Defendant's conduct caused significant harm to the legal profession.
Defendant's failure to communicate with clients, failure to resolve the matters for which
he was retained, and repeated misrepresentatious caused his clients to feel their trust had
been betrayed. Many of Defendant's former clients expressed a sense of distrust of the
legal profession in general due to Defendant's conduct.
13.
During the prosecution of this disciplinary case against Defendant,
Defendant failed to appear at his duly noticed deposition and failed to respond to various
requests from the State Bar for evidence.
14.
During the investigation of this disciplinary case against Defendant,
Defendant falsely claimed that the only out-of-state entities for whom he was working
were Family Court Direct and Professional Closing Network; he falsely claimed to a
State Bar investigator that he was not working with any other out-of-state entities despite
the fact that he was working with Yolks Anwalt at the time he made that statement.
Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel also enters the following
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the hearing panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. 18 ยง .OI14(w)(l) of the Ru1es and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and concludes that the following factors are applicable in this matter:
a. Defendant's intent to commit acts where the harm or potential hann is
foreseeable;
b. Defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness, or integrity;
c. Defendant's elevation of the his own interest above that of the client;
d. The negative impact of Defendant's actions on client's or public's
perception of the profession;

9

e. The negative impact of the Defendant's actions on the administration of
justice;

f. Defendant's impainnent of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the
representation;
g. The negative effect of Defendant's conduct on third parties;
h. Defendant's acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication;
and

i. Defendant's multiple instances of failure to participate in the legai
profession's self-regulation process.
2.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the factors enumerated
in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง .OI14(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina
State Bar and concludes that the following factor is present and warrants disbarment:
a. Defendant's acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication.

3.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the factors enumerated
in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง .01l4(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina
State Bar and finds the following factors warrant disbarment:
a. Defendant's prior disciplinary offenses in this state;
b. Defendant's dishonest or selfish motive;
c. Defendant's pattern of misconduct;
d. Defendant's multiple offenses;
e. Defendant's bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by
intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary
agency;

f. Defendant's submission of false evidence, false statements, or other
deceptive practices during the disciplinary process;
g. Defendant's refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct;
h. The vulnerability of the victims Defendant harmed;
i.

Defendant's degree of experience in the practice oflaw;

j. The imposition of other penalties or sanctions on Defendant, to wit: his
disbarment from the Western District of North Carolina Bankruptcy
Court;

10

k. Defendant's failure to rectify the consequences of his actions; and
I. Defendant's lack of remorse.
4.
Whenever attorneys aid in the unauthorized practice of law, there is the
potential for hann. The risks include a lack of knowledge of the law or procedures
particular to that jurisdiction, confusion by the clients and third parties about who is
representing the clients, misrepresentation, and damage to the administration of justice.
But perhaps most fuundationally, whenever attorneys aid in the unauthorized practice of
law, it inhibits that jurisdiction's ability to protect the public by regulating the profession
therein.
5.
Defendant's conduct cansed significant hann to the standing of the
profession in the eyes of his clients and has the potential to cause significant hann to the
standing of the profession in the eyes of the public because it shows his disregard for his
duties as an attorney. Such erosion of public confidence in attorneys tends to sully the
reputation of, and fosters disrespect for, the profession as a whole. Confidence in the
legal profession is a building block for public trust in the entire legal system.
6.
Defendant caused significant hann to the profession by repeatedly failing
to respond to State Bar inquires and otherwise failing to participate in the grievance
process. Additionally, Defendant submitted false evidence to the State Bar and failed to
participate in the present proceeding, including failing to appear at the hearing or his
duly-noticed deposition. Defendant's conduct demonstrates his continued refusal to
participate in thc self-regulatory process, his bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary
proceedings by intentionally failing to comply with the rules or orders of the disciplinary
agency, and his refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct. Such conduct
interferes with the State Bar's ability to regulate its members and undermines the
profession's privilege to remain self-regulating.
7.
One of the foundational principles of being an attorney is a willingness to
subject oneself to the high standards of the profession. In North Carolina, being an
attorney means willingly accepting the accountability provided by the attorney's peers on
the State Bar Council. This allows the public to trnst attorneys with, usually, the most
important aspects of their lives. During the course of this disciplinary case, Defendant
made it abundantly clear that he does not accept that accountability, that he does not want
to participate in the self-regulatory process, and that he does not want to be held to the
standards of the profession. In doing so, he has inspired no confidence that he can be
trnsted to be a licensed attorney going forward.
S.
Defendant is a danger to the public due to his repeated misconduct,
multiple misrepresentations, and ongoing refusal to participate in the self-regulatory
process. Defendant's inability or unwillingness to comply with the Rules of Professional
Conduct requires this Panel to disbar Defendant as the only means to adequately
acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct and protect the public.

11

9.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser sanctions and concludes that any
discipline short of disbarment would not adequately protect the public for the following
reasons:
a. Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses; would not adequately protect
the clients, the public, and the administration of justice; and would send
the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct
expected of members of the Bar of this State;
b. The protection of the public and the legal profession requires that
Defendant not be permitted to resume the practice of law until he
demonstrates the following: that he has refol1ned; thst he understands his
obligations to his clients, the public, the courts, and the legal profession;
and that reinstatement will not be detrimental to the public or the integrity
and standing of the legal profession. Disbarred lawyers are required to
make such a showing before they may resume practicing law, whereas no
such showing of refol1llation is required of attorneys whose licenses are
suspended; thus, disbannent is necessary; and
c. Defendant has failed to refol1ll his conduct in response to lesser discipline.
10.
Due to the nature and extent of Defendant's conduct, the significant harm
or potential harm of his conduct caused by his conduct to clients, the administration of
justice, and the profession, and Defendant's prior discipline, the Hearing Panel concludes
that disbannent is the only discipline that will adequately protect clients, the public, the
administration ofjustice, and the profession from future transgressions by Defendant.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Findings
Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1.
