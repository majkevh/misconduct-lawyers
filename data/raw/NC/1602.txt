Baied upon the stipulations of th~ parties and the evidence
'at trial, the Hearing Committee mak~~ the following Findings of
Fact in ~egard to the Plaintiff'd,second dlaim' for Relief by
cleai, 'c6gent, and,c~nvincing evidence:
1.
In the early summer ~f 1~86, the Defend~nt 'was employed
by Mr. & Mrs. Kenneth Ingram to represent them relative to the~r
purchase of a house and l,ot from Mr. & Mrs. James J. Lewis.
It
was contemplated, that the Defendant would examine title to the
property, provide the necessary assurances of title and close the
transaction.
The, closing was scheduled for July 18, 1996.

2.
Inciden,t to his employment, the Defendant was provided
with a copy of art "Offer to purchase and Contract" which had been
ex~cuted by 'the patties and which sp~cified th~ terms of their
ag~eement.
The "o~fer to purchase and Contract" provided for the'
payment of $9,000 as earnest money.
3.
After, contracting to purchase the subj~ct p'roperty, Mr.
& ~rs. I~gram appl~ed for a loan f~o~Chrysler First FinanOial
se~vices corpor~tibn (Chrysler).
This loan was to be' used to pay
off a s~cond deed bf trust against the property and was to be
seCured by a new s~cond de~d of tru.t.
Chrysler approved the
loan based upon thE:! Ingram's loan application fo~m and the "offer
to purchase and ,contract".

4.
on or about July 9, 1986, the Defendant examined the
title to the subject property and tranSmitted ,his title opinion
to Chrysler, thereby undertaking to represent the inter~sts of
the lender as well as those of the purchasers in the transaction.
5.
sometime prior to the sched,ule,d
the Lewises decided to substitu~e a note
amo~nt of $5,400 secured by a third ~eed
