even though you knew full well that the property had been transferred into
your name. While you may:not have intentionally filed a docurrent containing
inaccurate statements, you certainly failed to adequately review the document
to ascertain the accuracyiof its contents. In aoing so, you failed to handle
a legal matter wit1!.out pr~paration adeqUate in the circumstances in violation
of DR 6-101 (A) (2).

damag~d both your reputat~on and the profession's.
It placed your privilege
to serve the public as a. +awyer. in serious jeopardY.

you, that it will be rernerhlJered by you, and will be beneficial to you. The

strict adherence to the highest standards of the p+ofessio~. Instead of being
a burden, this Public Censure should serve as a profitable and everpresent
reminder to weigh carefully your respOnsibilities to your clients, to the
public, to your fellow attorneys, and to the courts •.
