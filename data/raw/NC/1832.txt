No. 7228SC672
(Filed 25 October 1972)
'1. Appeal and Error § 6- denial of motion to dismiss - denial of motion
for jury trial- interlocutory order
An order denying a motion to dismiss a complaint seeking disciplinary action against an attorney and denying a request for a
jury trial is interlocutory and not subject to appeal before trial and
final judgment. G.S. 1-277.

2. Attorney and Client § 10- discipline and disbarment of attorneysstatutory and judicial methods
In North Carolina there are two methods by which disciplinary
action or disbarment may be imposed upon attorneys-statutory 'and
judicial; the judicial method is not dependent upon statutory authority,
but arises because of a court's inherent authority to take disciplinary
action against attorneys licensed before it, an authority extending
'even to matters not pending in the particular court exercising the
'. au~hority.
.
3. Attorney ,and Client § 10- discipline or disbarment' of attorney - sufficiency of complaint
Complaint alleged sufficient facts to subject an attorney to
disciplinary action or disbarment where it alleged that the attorney
and a bondsman told a person charged with drunken driving that his
license could be saved for $1;000, that-the-acc1ised' paid'thatamolllit
to the attorney and the attorney told him he had' "been tried and
found not guilty," that prior to the trial date the warrant, bond and
shuck file relating to the drunken driving case disappeared from the
clerk's office, that a new warrant was issued and the accused was
tried under that warrant, that the bondsman returned $1,000 to the
accused before the trial and a ,new bond was made without charge,
and that the attorney appeared for the accuse,d in the trial without
charge.

(Harry C.), Judge, 22 May 1972 Session of Superior Court held

in BUNCOMBE County.
Civil action seeking, among other things, disciplinary action
against respondent, Grover C. Mooneyham, as an attorney
licensed to practice in this State.
On 1 May 1972 the solicitor for the 28.thSolicitorial District
filed a sworn complaint in the Superior Court of Buncombe
County. The first of two counts in the complaint alleges in substance the following:
On 13 January 1971, Edgar Ernest Bell was arrested in
Buncombe County and charged with violating G:S. 20-138
(operating a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating
liquor). He was cited to appear in District Court for trial on
1 February 1971 and his bond in the ,sum of $300.00 was ,made
by Northwestern Bonding Co., Inc. Bell told Jack Morgan, an
agent of Northwestern, that he wished to forfeit his bond and
paid Morgan $300.00 '~in addition to $60 which Morgan said
represented an attorney's fee in the forfeiture proceedingf!."
Morgan later sent word to Bell that he thought he knew a way
to save Bell's driver's license. The two men then met with
respondent Mooneyham; a licensed attorney, in Mooneyham's
office. Mooneyham and Morgan advised Bell that his license
could be saved for aypro'l!'irp.t:~ly $1,0.00.00, with the $300.00
which had been j"E.i;'; '~';:'l"i'~/ ,.~.;. ?Je~,r::r credited against that
,amount. On 30 January 1971, Bell paid $700.00 to Mooneyham,
and told Mooneyham that he did not want a capias issued for
him. Mooneyham replied: "[Y] ou have 'been tried and found '
n,ot guilty." Prior to the trial date, the warra~t,bond,and
,- shuck, file -relating to the' case against Bell' disappeared~ , The'
clerk's office, not having given the case a number, has no index
record of the original case. When the arresting officer discovered that the clerk's office ~ad no record of the case, a
new warrant was issued and Bell was tried under the new
warrant on 14 February 1972. Morgan returned $1,000.00 to
Bell before trial, and a new ,bond for Bell was made without
charge by American Bonding Co., Inc. Morgan is now president

Court where he was represented by another lawyer and again

'AIl~gations in count two of the complaint have been

Based upon ,the sworn allegations in the complaint, Judge
Thornburg signed an order directing Mooneyham to appear in
Superior Court at,a time specified for the purpose of showing
cause why disciplinary action should not be taken aga:inst, him
as~ an ,attorney at law. The complaint and order to show cause
wer~' served ~ on Mooneyham, and he personally appeared and
agreed to file' answer on or before 17 May 1972. On that date
Mooneyham' filed an answer admitting that he appeared, for
Bell in District Court as alleged in the complaint. Other allegatitms in the complaint pertaining to Mooneyham, except for
the allegation that he is a licensed and practicing attorney, are
denied.
On 22 May 1912 Judge Martin entered an OJ;der qenying
Mooneyham's motion to dismiss the complaint, aud also denying
a request for ,a jury trial made in Mooneyham's answer. Mooneyham appeals from this order.

opinion, it is not subject to ,appeal before trial and final judgment. G.S. 1-277; Rule 4, Rules of Practice in the Court of

to treat the appeal as a petition for certiorari,. allow it and consider the questions raised on their merits.

as alleged in the complaint has been delegated exclusively to

[21 It is trug that by virtue of G.S. 84-28 to 32~ questions relating to the propriety and ethics of an attorney :are ordinarily
for the' consideration of the North Carolina State Bar. In re
Burton, 257 N.C. 534, 126, S.E. 2d 581 ; McMichael v. Proctor,
243 N.C. 479, 91 S.E. 2d 231. G.S. 84-36 specifically provides,
however, that the provisions of these 'statutes are not to be
construed as disabling or abridging the inherent powers of a
court to deal with its ,attorneys. Furthermore, it lias been held
repeatediy that in North Caroiina there are two methods by
which disCiplinary action or disbarment may ,be imposeQ. upon
attorneys-statutory and judicial. In re Burton, supra; In re
Gil~iland, 248 N.C. 517, 103 S.E. 2d ,807; In re West, 212 N.C.
189, 193 S.E. 134; Committee on Grievances of Bar Association
v. Strickland,~OO N.C. 630, 158 S.E. 110; In re St'iers, 204 N.C.
48, 167 S.E. 382. The judicial method is not dependent upon
statutory authority. It arises because ot a court's inherent
authority to take disciplinary action against attorneys licensed
before it; an authority which extends even to matters which are
not pending iil tlie' pa~ic~lar 'court exercising Jh~.Atith9r~ty'. v
This power is based 'upon- tlie' relationship of the attorney to
the court and' the authority which the court has over its own
Qfficers to prevent them from, or punish them for, acts of d~s­
honesty or impropriety calculated to bring contempt upon the
administration of justice. In re Burton, supra; State v .. Spivey,
213 N.C. 45, 195 S.E. 1.

C·
~

[3] Appellant next challenges the sufficiency of the complaint,
contending that the facts alleged therein do not charge him with
any act which would subject him to discipline or disbarment.
Misconduct of a serious nature is so manifest from the allegations in the complaint that this contention may be rejected without discussion.

[4] Appellant's final contention is that the court erred in
denying his motion for a jury trial. This raises· a more difficult
question. Appellant cites the case of State v. Parrish, ~54 N.C.
301, 118 S.E. 2d 786, for the proposition that a. Jicense to engage
in the practice of law is a property right that cannot be taken
away without due process of law. There can ,be no argument as
to this principle. Ex. parte Wall, 107 U.S. 265, 2 S.Ct~ 569, 27

In re Bonding Co.

In re Bonding Co.

question, however, is whether "due process" in an action of this
sort encompasses a right to a trial by jury. If the action were
based on the statutory procedure, the answer would be "yes"
because G.S.84-28 expressly grants a right to trial by jury,
upon appeal from the council of the Bar, on the written evi,.
dence of the issues of fact arising on the pleadings. In re Gilliland, supra. The procedure erpployed here, however, is not
statutory. It is judicial, and we find no statute which provides
for a jury trial when the judicial method is employed to seek
disciplinary action against an attorney practicing in this State.

It is almost universally held that in the absence of a statute
so providing, procedural due process does not require that an
attorney have a jury trial in a ·disciplinary or disbarment proceeding. See 7 Am. JUl'. 2d, Attorneys at Law, § 63, and cases
cited. Traditionally, only a small minority of states have provided for a jury trial in any type of disbarment proceeding. 14
N.C.L. Rev. 374; 45 Harv. L.Rev. 737; 11 Tex. L.Rev. 28. See
also Ex pa1'te Thompson, 228 Ala. 113, 152 So. 229, 107 A.L.R.
671, which extensively reviews the position of the various states
with respect to affording jury trials in proceedings of this natUre.

While the question here involved has apparently never been
precisely presented to our Supreme Court, in the case of In re
BUTton, sup-ra, the court discussed at length the due process
requirements of both the· statutory and judicial methods. It
is pointed out in that 9pinion that under the statuto:rY method
there must be a written complaint, notice to the accused, an
opportunity to answer and to be represented by counsel, a hearing before a committee conducting proceedings in the nature of
a reference, and a trial by jU1'y unless waived. Under the judicial
method, it is said that "where the attorney pleads guilty or is
convicted in another court, or the conduct complained of is not
related to litigation pending before the court investigating
attorneys' alleged misconduct, the procedure, to meet the test
of due process, must be initiated by a sworn written complaint,
and the court should issue a rule or ordElr advising the attorney
of the specific charges, directing him to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken, and granting a reasonable
'time for answering and. prepar~,tion of defense, and attorney
should be given full opportullii,f to ;~G' };;:;,UQ· and permitted to
have counsel for his defense." In 1'e But'ton, supra at 544, 126
S,E, 2d at 588-589, We think it is significant that, in outlining
the due process elements of the judicial method, the court did
not mention a right to trial by jury. On the other hand, it stated
that '''[wj here issues of fact are raised the COUl't 'may ajijioi"nt
a committee to investigate and make report." In 1'e BUTton,
supm at 544, 126 S.E. 2d at 589. Several cases are cited where
no jury trial was afforded and an investigative committee was
utilized. AttOT1WY Geneml v. GOTson, 209 N.C. 320, 183 S.E.
392;.Attome1! Gene,'al v, Winbut'n, 206 N.C. 923, 175 S.E. 498;
In 1'e Stim's, supra; Committee on Grievances of Bar Association
.
v. Strickland, supra.

A disbarment proceeding is usually considered civil in nature
rather than criminal. In 1'e Gilliland, supra; In re West, supra.
Appellant contends that Article 1, Section 25 of the North Carolina Constitution applies here as in other civil proceedings.
This section provides: "Right of jU1'Y tTial in civil cases. In all
controversies at law respecting property, the ancient mode of
trial .by jury is one of the best securities of the rights of the
people, and shall remain sacred and inviolable." However, the
right to jury trial preserved under this section applies only in
cases in which the prerogative existed at common law or by
statute at the time the Constitution was adopted. In 1'e Wallace,
267 N.C. 204, 147 S.E. 2d 922; Belle's Department Store, Inc. v.
Guilford County, 222 N.C. 441, 23 S.E. 2d 897.

______________________________. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

An attorney had no right at common law to trial by jury
when called upon by a 'court to answer allegations of misconduct bearing upon his fitness as an officer of the court.
.Ex paTte Wall, supra; Ex paTte Thompson, 81(.pra; In re Ca1'ver,
224 Mass. 1:)9, :::;;',I'C: ~.':; ·:~~16) .. As stated in the case of
Ex pa1'te Wail,swpm, !'lijt is a mistaken idea that due process
of law requires a plenary suit and a trial by jury, in all cases
where property or personal rights are involved." In that case
the Supreme Court of the United States refused a disbarred
~ttoJ;Qey's..petition which sought-to· have the' order of his <lis-'
barment vacated. The attorney, who had been convicted of no
offense, was not afforded a trial by jury on the factual issues
raised by a trial court's charge that he did "engage in and with
an unlawful, tumultuous and riotous gathering, he advising and
encouraging thereto, take from the jail . . . and hang by the
neck until 'he was dead, one John. . . . " The Supreme Court
reviewed extensively the procedures followed at common Jaw
and in the various states and concluded that "in the present

Insurance' § 79.1- automobile ,liability insurance rates- failure to make
necessary findings - remaud
Automobile liability insurance rate' case is r!)manded to' the Como,
missioner of Insurance with direction that specific findings of fact
be niade, upon substaIitia~ evidenc!!, as"to (I) the earned premiums
to be anticipated 'by companies operating in North Carolina during
the life of ,policies to be issued in the near future~ (2) the reasonably

ApPEAL by Attorney General, intervenor, from decision and
orger of Commissioner of Insurance entered 26 May 1972.
On 1 July 1971 the North Carolina Automobile Rate Administrative Office "(Rate Office) made a filing with the Gommissioner of Insurance (Co~missio:ner), pursuant to G.S. 58248, which filing proposed a schedule of increased rates on private passenger automobile liability insurancE.! in the amount of
16A% for bodily injury -insurance and 29.0%, for property
damage insurance, making an overall or average increase of
21.4%. On 21 July 1971, the Commissioner entered an order,
based on 1 July 1970 filing, increasing liability insurance
rates on private passenger automobiles 7.7%; as a result of
this order the Rate Office, by amen!iment, reduced its request
for an increase in rates to 13.9%.
After due advertisement as required by law, the Commissioner conducted a hearing on said 1971 filing on 16 September
1971 and thereafter recessed and continued the hearing on 29
and 30 September, 4 and 28 October, 22 November, and 14 December 1971, and 25 January, 10; 11, and 21 February, 15
March" and 18 and 26 April 1972 at which time the hearing
was concluded.' .
On 23 August 1971 the Attorney General, as authorized by
G.S. 114-2 (8) (a), intervened in behalf of "the insurance consuming public," and denied that any revision of private pas-

case, due notice was .given to the petitioner, and a trial "and
hea:ring was had before the court, in the lllaIi:per in whIch proceedings against attorneys, when -the question is whether they
should be struck off, the' roll, are always, cQnducted."
We find no evidence that a right to trial by jury in a case
of this nature existed by statute .in this state at the time o~r
Constitution was adopted. In 1871, a statute was enacted which
, provided: "That no person -who shall have been duly iicensed
to practice law~as an attorney; shall be debarr\,!d or deprived of
his license and right so to practice law either permanently or
temporarily, ~nless he shall have b~en convicte~ or in open
coui:tconfessed hi~s~lf.guilty _of some criniinal offense, showing him to be unfit to be trusted in t1;le discharge of the duties
of his profession." Ch. 216, § 4, [1871], Public Laws of N. C.
336 at, 337. This statute was subsequently held to take from
the court the common law power to purge the bar of unfit
members, except in the cases specified. See Ex pa1·te McCown,
139 N.C. 95, 51 S.E. 957; In re Gorham, 129 N.C. 481, 40
S.E~ 311; In re:oldham, 89 N.C. 23; Kane v. Haywood, 66 N.C.
1; Ex parte Schenck, 65, N.C. 353. The effect of the statute,
as construed in these cases, was to deprive a court of the authority to disbar an attorney unless he was convicted by a jury
or confessed in open court when charged ina bill of indictment.
This statute WaS repealed in 1933. Before its repeal, the Supreme
Court noted that the statute "was not intended to restrict the
right to disbar in CllBes calling for disbarment which was not
imposed under the power to punish for contempt. There has
been some confusion in not distinguishing between disbarment
for contempt, which was restricted by the statute, and disbarment on account of the misconduct of counsel in matters affecting his fitness to be a me:r:pber of the bar." McLean v. Johnson,
174 N.C., 345, 348,,93 S.E. 847,848-49 (1917),
We conclude that this State has never had a statute which
expressly conferred upon an attorney the :right to a trial by
jury in a judicial disciplining or disbarment proceeding. Since
np such right existed at common law, or by statute at the ti~e
our Constitution was adopted, and is not now provided for by
statute; we hold that appellant's motion for a trial by jury was
properly denied.
