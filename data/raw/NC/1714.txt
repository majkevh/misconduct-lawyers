5.

..Fr6m January. of 1985 through April of 1988., defendant
removed from the. Trust Account interest earned on the
Trbst Account for Client Funds as fotlows:
$ 5,523.85
1985
$ 5,713.48
1986
1987 --- $ l,785.Q6
$
546.00
1988
Total = $l3,598.39

6.

The above interest accumulated primarily on real ·estate
closing ·funds remaining. il1 the Trust Accpunt ?is a
"float." That is, even tnough Trust Account ·checks wer~
disbursed at closing, the Trust Account was not debited
until sometime thereafter. Thus, there was a period of
time when the Client. Funds remained in the Trust Account
and accrued interest.

7.

Defendant was required, pursuant to DR 9--102(A) (3) and
DR 9-102(C) (1) of the Code of Professional Responsibility
(as amended by the NC Supreme Court on June 23, 1983)' and
Rule 10.l(D,) and Rule lO.3 of the Rules of ProfesSional
Conduct, t9 either hold the interest earned on the Client
Funds for his clients or remit the interest generated to
the North Carolina state Bar pursuant to the Intere~t on
Lawyer's Trust Account ("IOLTA") program.

'" 8.

When defendant was admitted to the ptactice of law in
No:r:;th ·Carolina in 1958, ahd when defendant completed his
service with the u.s. Air Force and returned to his real
estate law practice in. 1961, there was no rule or
requirement that interest on clients' trust funds be held
for the clients or remitted to the IOLTA program.

9.

From J'anuary of 1985 to April 1988, defendant failed to
remit the interest earned on the Client Funds to' IOLTA or
the clients on whose funds the interest had accumulated.
Def:endant used the interest earned on th~ II float'"
described above for his own use or for the use of persons
other than his clients.

,

I

lO. On or about April 20, 1988, defendant ,was randomly
selected pursuant to section 28(2) of ,the Rules of
Discipline and. Disbarment for a procedural- audit of his
trust account.
ll. On Qr about May 6, 1988, Bruno E. DeMol-li, North Carolina
state Bar Auditor, review~d defendanb's trust accouht and
determined that defendant had paid ·the interest earned on
the· trust account to himself.
Defendant cooperated
.completely with Mr .. DeMolli, making available alt of his
'trust account records. On that same day, defendant
notified the IOLTA Board of Trustees of his desire to
participate in the IOLTA.program. He has continued since
then to participate in the program .

13. De!endant'made payments totalling $4,o.6~.39. through
December 22, 1988. By letter dated September 5,1989,
defenqant requested permi~sion from the IOLTA'Board pf
':['ru~te~s to defer the monthly payments of $5.0.0. due in .
1989 and to resume such payments in 1990.. Defendant was
granted that permission by tel~phone from the Sti;ite Ba·r·· ... --, .
Office. ,Defendant did not make any paym~n1;:s in 1989'.
Defendant made one payment of $500. on January 24', 1990..•
Defendant did not make any payments in 1991.. On Marcn 2"
1992, 'defenqant paid the balance owed of $9,000..
14. The North Carol~na state Bar Newsletter and Quarterly
have been pUblished once each qUarter throughout the year

.
15.' Defendant paid income tax on the interest he earned on
the Trust Account for the Client Funds bet~een 1985 and
.1988.
16. Defendant had an active residential real estate practice
in 1989, 1990. and 1991-

I

1;7.. Most residential real estate closings handled by
defendant involved property already covered by a title
insurance policy. During the time~ rel~vant he~ein,
title insurance companies charged a lower "reiss~e rate"
whenever a prior title policy was submitted with the .
attorney's title' opinion, regardless of whether the prior
policy was issued by the same company as the prospec,tive,
company .
.18. Before submitting tqe final title opinion, defendant at .
times: (1) obtained a copy of the prior title policy
covering the same property, (2) used it to obtain the,
lower 'reissue rate, and (3) charged i;ind collected from
the buyer the standard or full premil,lm.for a title
insurance policy as opposed to the lower reissue rate.
However, in every case when the existence.ofa prior
title policy was known by the time of· closing, the client.
was given the benefit of the lower premium, and it was'
only where the prior policy wa,s subsequently disc'overed
that this was not done.
19. In most of these cases, defendant did not obtain the
client's informed consent before payinc;J himselJ~ the
difference in premiums.

and what was actually paid for the title insurance
