SEAN DAVID SOBOLESKI, and
JANE DEARWESTER SOBOLESKI,
Attorneys,
Defendants

THIS MATTER was considered by a hearing panel of the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission composed of Fred M. Morelock, Chair, David W. Long, and Tyler B.
Morris. Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar, was represented by Margaret Cloutier.
Defendant Sean David Soboleski was represented by Robert B. Long, Jr. Defendant Jane
Dearwester Soboleski was represented by Dudley A. Witt and David B. Freedman.
Defendants waive a formal hearing in this mater. The parties stipulate and agree to the
findings of fact and conclusions of law recited in this order, and consent to the discipline
imposed by this order. By consenting to the entry ofthis order, Defendants knowingly,
freely, and voluntarily waive their rights to appeal this consent order or to challenge in
any way the sufficiency of the findings and conclusions herein.
Based on the foregoing and with the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel
hereby makes by clear, cogent and convincing evidence the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT
1.
Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar ("State Bar"), is a body duly
organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this
proceeding under the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the North Carolina General
Statutes, and the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar promulgated
thereunder.
2.
Defendant, Sean David Soboleski ("Soboleski" or "Defendant"), was
admitted to the North Carolina State Bar on March 24, 2001, and is, and was at all times
I

referred to herein, an attorney at law licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the
laws of the State of North Carolina, the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina
State Bar and the Rules of Professional Conduct.
3.
Defendant, Jane Dearwester Soboleski, now Jane Dearwester,
("Dearwester" or "Defendant"), was admitted to the North Carolina State Bar on August
24,2001, and is, and was at all times referred to herein, an attorney at law licensed to
practice in North Carolina, subject to the laws of the State of North Carolina, the Rules
and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and the Rules of Professional Conduct.
4.
During some or all of the relevant periods referred to herein, Soboleski
and Dearwester were engaged in the practice of law in the State of North Carolina and
maintained a law office in Asheville, Buncombe County, North Carolina.
5.

Defendants were properly served with the summons and complaint in this

matter.
6.
From July 1,2012 through August 29, 2014, Defendants maintained three
attorney trust accounts: Home Trust Bank trust account ending in no. 1115 (hereinafter
"the general trust account"), Home Trust Bank trust account ending in no. 1412
(hereinafter" the real estate trust account"), and Mountain First Bank trust account
ending in no. 3575 (hereinafter "the Mountain First trust account").
7.
Defendants did not at least quarterly total the individual client balances
and reconcile those and the general ledger balance for each trust account to the bank
statement balance for each trust account as a whole.
8.
Defendants did not always maintain accurate client ledgers and did not
always record disbursements and deposits contemporaneously with the transactions.
9.
Defendants did not record on checks the client balances against which the
items were drawn.
10.
Defendants did not indicate on the face of checks made payable to them
the client balances from which the items were drawn.
11.
Defendants made electronic transfers from the trust accounts that did not
record the client balances from which the transfers were made.
12.
Defendants employed a disorganized and at times haphazard manner of
disbursing earned fees from clients' deposit for fees in Defendants' general trust account.
Combined with the lack of contemporaneous recording of transactions on the client
ledger cards, Defendants' methods of disbursing fees from the general trust account
resulted in mismanagement of individual clients' entrusted funds on many occasions.

2

13.
This mismanagement resulted in Defendants disbursing funds to
themselves from the general trust account attribntable as fees earned for specific clients
in excess of the fees earned at that time on a number of occasions. For example:
(a)

On February 18,2013, Defendants disbursed $525.00 to themselves
without recording the disbursement on the client ledger card. On March
15,2013, Defendants disbursed $737.50 to themselves, which erroneously
included the $525.00 already disbursed for the same activities.

(b)

On February 18,2013 Defendants disbursed to themselves $112.50. On
February 19,2013, Defendants disbursed $237.50 to themselves, which
erroneously included the $112.50 already disbursed for the same activities.

(c)

On or about February 21 and 27, 2013, Defendants recorded on an
adhesive note legal services performed for client Edwards and disbursed
the corresponding amount from Edwards' entrusted funds on that date;
however, on an invoice sent to the client, Defendants recorded that the
legal services had been performed on March 5, 2013, creating the
appearance that they had collected fees before the fees had been earned.

14.
This mismanagement also resulted in Defendants disbursing to themselves
amounts that were less than the fees they had earned at that time on multiple occasions.
15.
This mismanagement resulted in Defendants disbursing funds from the
general trust account for the benefit of clients in excess of the amounts deposited into the
account for those clients on a number of occasions. For example:
(a)

For client Gay, Defendants disbursed to themselves $336.25 in payment of
legal services on September 21,2012. At the time ofthe disbursement, .
client Gay had a balance in the general trust account of$186.25.
Defendants deposited $1,500.00 into the general trust account paid by Gay
on October 4,2012.

(b)

For client Rice, Defendants disbursed to themselves $700.00 in payment
oflegal services on March 30, 2014. At the time of the disbursement,
client Rice had a balance in the general trust account of $532.50.

16.
At the time Defendants made these overdisbursements, Defendants were
ho Iding the trust account earned fees that had not yet been disbursed to Defendants;
however, the overdisbursements exceeded the amount of earned fees. To the extent the
undisbursed earned fees were insufficient to rectify the overdisbursements, Defendants
failed to safeguard entrusted funds by using without authorization funds held in a
fiduciary capacity for other clients to fund the deficiencies.
17.
As of February 27, 2014, Defendants were obligated to hold in trust
$260.00 on behalf of client Turnip for the payment of costs to the North Carolina Court
3

of Appeals. Due to the mismanagement of the trust accounts, on or about February 20,
2014, Defendants disbursed $810.00 to themselves in payment of attorney fees from the
funds they held on behalf of Turnip. The $810.00 disbursement from the Turnip account
for payment of attorney fees depleted all the funds that had been deposited on behalf of
Turnip, including the funds Defendants were obligated to hold for payment of costs to the
North Carolina Court of Appeals.
18.
Despite attempts made by Defendants to rectify the problems in the
general trust account both before and after the State Bar's Letter of Notice sent to
Defendants, as of August 29, 2014, the balance in Defendants' general trust account was
less than the amount of entrusted funds Defendants were required to maintain for the
benefit of their clients due to Defendants' continued mismanagement of the trust account
and trust account records.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and with the consent of the parties, the
Hearing Panel makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
I.
All parties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the DHC has
jurisdiction over Defendants and over the subject matter of this proceeding.
2.
Defendants' conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes
grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง84-28(b)(2) in that Defendants
violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as follows:
(a)

By failing at least qualterly to total the individual client ledger balances
and reconcile those and the general ledger balances with the adjusted bank
statement bal~nces for each trust account as a whole, Defendants failed to
perform quarterly reconciliations of the trust accounts in violation of Rule
U5-3(d);

(b)

By failing to maintain accurate client ledgers, by failing to record on
checks the client balances against which the items were drawn, and by
making electronic transfers that did not record the client balances on
which the transfers were made, Defendants failed to maintain the
mininmm records required for general trust accounts in violation of Rille
U5-3(b);

(c)

By failing to identify on trust account checks payable to Defendants the
client balances from which the funds were drawn, Defendants failed to
indicate on an item payable to the lawyer the client balances from which
the item was drawn in violation of Rule 1.15-2(h);

(d)

By disbursing from the trust accounts more funds for clients than
Defendants held in the trust accounts for the benefit of those clients,

4

Defendants failed to properly maintain entmsted funds in violation of Rule
1.15-2(a), allowed another to benefit from entrusted funds in violation of
Rule 1.15-2G), and failed to properly disburse entrusted funds in violation
of Rule 1.15-2(m);
(e)

By disbursing funds to themselves from the general trust account
attributable as fees earned for providing legal services specific clients at a
time when Defendants had not yet earned those fees, Defendants failed to
properly maintain entrusted funds in violation of Rule 1.15-2(a), obtained
personal benefit from entmsted funds in violation of Rule 1.15-2G), and
failed to properly disburse entrusted funds in violation of Rule 1.15-2(m);
and

(1)

By failing to hold $260.00 in trust on behalf of client Turnip and by failing
to maintain in the general trust account all funds Defendants were
obligated to hold for the benefit of each client who should have had funds
in the accounts, Defendants failed to properly maintain entrusted funds in
violation of Rule 1.15-2(a), allowed another to benefit from entrusted
funds in violation of Rule 1.15-2(j), and failed to properly disburse
entrusted funds in violation of Rule 1.15-2(m).

Based upon the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel also fmds by clear,
cogent and convincing evidence the following:
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
Although Defendants' failure to properly monitor, track, and safeguard
entrusted funds resulted in some funds being used for the benefit of someone other than
the beneficial owner of the funds, there is no evidence that Defendants knowingly or
intentionally misused entrusted client funds, there is no evidence that Defendants
intended to harm their clients, and there is no evidence of any dishonest motive on the
part of Defendants. The evidence shows the deficiencies resulted from Defendants'
failure to maintain client ledgers properly, failure to accurately track earned fees and the
disbursements of earned fees, and failure to properly reconcile their trust accounts
quarterly. Defendants demonstrated extreme recklessness in the handling of the funds
entrusted to them by their clients from which they could have foreseen that the
safeguarding of those funds was at risk.

2.
Defendants ultimately properly credited the full amount of each client's
entrusted funds against legal fees incurred despite instances in which Defendants
disbursed more funds for the benefit of specific clients than Defendants held for the
benefit of those clients thereby using funds held for the benefit of other clients to fund
those disbursements. Nevertheless, Defendants' conduct in over-disbursing entrusted
funds from their trust account caused potential significant harm to their clients whose

5

entrusted funds were used for the benefit of someone other than the beneficial owner of
the funds without their knowledge or consent.
3.
Defendants did not always ensure that the amounts transferred from the
trust account in payment of fees correlated to specific services performed on behalf of
their clients, at times resulting in fees being transferred from the trust account before the
fees were earned as described in the Findings of Fact. On at least one occasion,
Defendants were aware that they had disbursed to themselves more funds than they had
earned, yet they failed to take all of the steps necessary to prevent future instances.
Although Defendants hired an office manager in late 2012 and implemented timekeeping
software in an effort to better organize their accounting practices, their efforts were
insufficient to fully rectify the problems and they failed to implement all of the necessary
changes to ensure that entrusted funds were properly handled.
4.
Despite instances in which Defendants transferred funds to themselves in
payment of attorney fees before the fees were earned, the goals of the representations
were not hindered in that there were no instances in which Defendants received more
funds than were earned for the entirety of those clients' cases.
5.
Keeping accurate client ledgers and conducting quarterly reconciliations
are the lynchpins of proper trust account maintenance and protection of entrusted funds.
Defendants' continued failure to properly reconcile their trust account and failure to
maintain proper trust account records demonstrates a pattern of misconduct and
demonstrates Defendants' intent to commit acts in which the potential harm is
foreseeable.
6.
Defendants' conduct placed entrusted funds at risk and had the potential to
cause significant harm to the standing of the profession in the eyes of the public because
it shows their disregard for their duties as attorneys. Such erosion of public confidence in
attorneys tends to sully the reputation of, and fosters disrespect for, the profession as a
whole. Confidence in the legal profession is a building block for public trust in the entire
legal system.
7.
Defendants fully cooperated with the State Bar throughout the disciplinary
process, and were candid and forthright in their responses to the State Bar's inquiries.
8.
Both Defendants have substantial experience in the practice oflaw, each
having been licensed since 2001.
9.
Defendants acknowledge the wrongful nature of their conduct and are
genuinely remorseful for their misconduct.
10.
Defendant Soboleski has prior professional discipline. In July 2015,
Soboleski was reprimanded by the Grievance Committee for asserting a charging lien at
the outset of representation when no judgment or settlement existed and for using a

6

client's entrusted funds for payment of legal fees for an unrelated matter without the
client's permission.
II.

Defendant Dearwester has no prior professional discipline.

12.

Both Defendants enjoy a good professional reputation in their community.

13.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the different forms of discipline
available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censnre, suspension, and disbarment, in
considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and with the
consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel also fmds by clear, cogent and convincing
evidence the following:
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. 1B ยง .0114(w)(I) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar
and concludes that the following factors are present:
(a)

Intent of the Defendants to commit acts where the harm or potential harm
is foreseeable; and

(b)

Negative impact of Defendants' actions on the public's perception of the
profession.

2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.
Admin. Code 1B ยง .0114(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes that no factors are present that warrant disbarment.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.
Admin. Code IB ยง .0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a)

Prior discipline in the form of a Reprimand issued in 2015 to Defendant
Soboleski;

(b)

Absence of a dishonest or selfish motive;

(c)

Pattern of misconduct;

(d)

Multiple offenses;

7

(e)

Full and free disclosure to the Hearing Panel and cooperative attitude
toward the proceedings;

(f)

Remorse;

(g)

Good character and reputation among their colleagues; and

(h)

Degree of experience in the practice of law as both have practiced since
2001.

4.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and fmds that a
public censure, reprimand, or admonition would not be sufficient discipline because of
the gravity of the potential harm to Defendants' clients, and the potential significant harm
Defendants' conduct caused to the public, the administration of justice, and the legal
profession.
5.
The Hearing Panel has considered all lesser sanctions and finds that
discipline short of suspension would not adequately protect the public, the profession and
the administration of justice for the following reasons:
(a)

The factors under Rule .01l4(w)(1) that are established by the evidence in
this case are of a nature that support imposition of suspension as the
appropriate discipline;

(b)

Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Defendants committed and
would send the wrong message to attorneys and to the public regarding the
conduct expected of members ofthe Bar of this state; and

(c)

Protection of the public requires that Defendants not be permitted to
resume the practice oflaw unless and until they demonstrate that they
understand their obligations as attorneys.

6. Defendants' conduct, if continued or tolerated by the Bar, poses significant
potential harm to future clients and to the profession.

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Findings and
Conclusions Regarding Discipline, and with consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel
enters the following
