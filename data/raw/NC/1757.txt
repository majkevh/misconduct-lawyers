you by Phi~ip Tomolonius.
Pursuant to sect,ion 13 (A) of article IX of the Rules and
Regulations of the North Ca~olina State Bar, the Grievance

informa'tion availaple to it, including your response to the
letter of nbtice, the Grievance Committee found probable cause.

A reprimand is a written form 6f discipline more serious
than an a4mqnition.issued in cases in which an attorney has
violated ,one or rn6re provisions of the Rules of Professional
·Conduct and· has caused harm orpoeential harm to a client, the
administrat:j..qn of justice, the profession, or a member of the
public, but. the misconduct does not require a censure.
The Grievance Committee was of the opinion .that a cerisure is
not required in this case ,and issues this reprimand to you.
As
ch~irman of the Grievance Committee o.f the North Carolina State
Bar, it i~ now my duty to issue this reprimand and I am certain
that you wiil understand fully the spirit in which this duty is
performed.

You r~presented Eric Tomolonius in 1991 rega~ding a DWI and
a domestic matter. Mr. Tomolonius' father, Phillip Tomolonius,
paid you $300 toward your fe.e in the domestic case. Your staff
,'apparently e:):"roneously poste9.; the $300 fee as a payment in th~
"DWI case, althqugh no fee was due you in that matter.

In April 1992, Tomolonius dischal;"ged You and 'his father :,
requested a refund of the $300 'which he had paid you in the
domestic matter. 'Although'the elder Tomolonius'made severa!':"
inquiries, ' it took you until Nov. 20,' 1992 to mail the refunq
check to him.
The,delayapp~ars to have been caused iIi part by
s~v~ral mistakes ?nd oversights by>your staff. ""Rule 2.8' of the
Rules of Professional Conduct requires at torne),rs"'to refund
1;lnearned portions', of fees, paid tq them promptly when reques:tE;d ,to
do so by the client." You violated this rule by delaying eight ,
months to return TotnoloniUs' fee.
The faqt that the delay was'
apparently att,ributable in part to your staf'f mitigates, but. doe 13 ,
,not excuse your misconduct, as Rule 3.3 of the' Rules of
,
,Professional Conduc'tmakes it clear that attorneys aJ;"e ul·tima1;;.,~ly
responsible for tra~ning and overseeing their non-att6rn~y
,"
staffs.

violated Rule 1.1(B} of the Rules of Professional Conduct by
failing to re$pond promp.tly to the 14th Judicial District
