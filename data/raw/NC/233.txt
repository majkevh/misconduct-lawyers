AFFIDAVIT
TO:

The Council of the North Carolina State Bar

I, James D. Cox, hereby tender my license to practice and
desire to resign from The North Carolina State Bar. My
resignation is tendered freely and voluntarily, is not the result
of coercion or duress, and I am fully aware of the implications
of submitting the resignation.
I am aware that there is presently pending an investigation
or other proceedings regarding allegations that I have been
guilty of misconduct to wit:
With respect to the Complaint of Terry Odom,
( 1)
Misrepresentations of material matters, both orally and
written, to Mr. Odom: and

(2)
Misrepresentations of material matters orally to North
Carolina State Bar investigators.
(3)
Disbursed funds to Terry Odom on November 17, 1992 from
my trust account when Odom had no funds in the account and I had
insufficient personal funds in the account to cover the amount of
Odom's check. As a result, funds belonging to another client
were used to pay Odom's check.
I acknowledge that the material facts upon which Mr. Odom's
Complaint is predicated and as found in the Consent Order of
Preliminary Injunction are true.
I am submitting my resignation
because I know that if charges were predicated upon the
misconduct under investigation I could not successfully defend
against them.
This 6th day of July, 1993.
