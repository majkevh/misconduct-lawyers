Alexander (hereafter, Wachovia CD). He obtained a cashier's check for the proceeds of
the certificate of deposit in the amount:of$1O,006.04.
9. On the same day, Linney deposited the $10,006.04 cashier's check into his
business/operating account number 1591001724 at Branch Banking & Trust Co.
(hereafter BB&T operating account). Linney personally filled out the deposit Slip
whereby the proceeds of the cashier's check were deposited into his BB&T operating
account. The deposit slip was clearly labeled to indicate that it related to the BB&T
operating account.

BB&T operating account, the balance in Linney's BB&T operating account was $961.64.

at the time he issued check number 1482 to himself. At most, Linney had only
