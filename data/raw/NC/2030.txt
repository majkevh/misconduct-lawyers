in North Carolina subject to the State Bar Rules and Regulations and the Rules of Professional
Condl:lct of North Carolina.,

DUring all or a part of the relevant periods referred to herein, Defendant was

engaging in the practice of law in the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office in
Cumberland County, North Carolina.
i 4.

the Defendant maintained a trust account in United National Bank in Fayetteville,

I

North :Carolina, account number 56 1192350 (The "Trust Account"). The Defendant also
maintained as a fiduciary art additional account at United National Bank in Fayetteville, account
numb~r

56 1432202 (the "Barton & Lee Trust Account").

: 5.

The Trust Account contains funds of mUltiple clients of the Defendant. The

Defendant has not maintained ledger cards for all of the funds maintained as a fiduciary and did
not maintain other records at the time of deposit of funds into the Trust Account or the Barton &
Lee TrUst Account to adequately ascertain what funds were held, deposited, or disbursed on
behalf of what clien~s or taken by or received by the Defendant prior to, at the time of or
:

subsequent to such .deposit.
6.

On or about March 13, 1995, the Defendant entered into a retainer agreement with

Bernetha O. Long, (hereafter "Long") pursuant to which the Defendant agreed to act as attorney

I

for LOl1g in a personal injury claim. The Defendant mailed a letter concerning the retention to
Long on March 16, 1995. The letter contains a notation "oUr File: LA1089" which reflects the
,

file nuIilber assigned by the Defendant to this matter.

into the, Trust Account on behalf of Long.

negotiated and cleared the bank within three days of their issuance.

$12,116.00 dollars, the same amount indicated on the disbursement sheet that was payable to the
i

Defe~dant as attorneys fees.
