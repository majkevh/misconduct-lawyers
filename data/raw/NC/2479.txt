laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this proceeding under the authority
granted itin Chapter 84 of the ~eneral Statutes of North Carolina, and the rules and regulations
of the North Carolina State Bar promulgated thereunder.
2.

The Defendant, Robert H. Corbett (hereafter "Defendant"), was admitted to the

North Carolina State Bar on 19 August 1973, and is, and was at all times referred to herein, an

I
.;.

"

attorney at law licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the rules, regulations and Rules
of Professional Conduct of the North Carolina State Bar and the laws of the State of North
Carolina.
3.

During all or a portion of the relevant periods referred to herein, Defendant was

actively eng~ged in the practice oflaw in the town ofBurga:v, Pender County, North Carolina.
4.

; Since at least 1990, and during all times relevant to the Defendant's conduct

described hefein, Defendant has been continually engaged under one or more contracts with

I

Pender County (hereafter "County") to provide legal advice and legal services to the Tax
Assessor and Tax Collector for the County and several municipalities within the County. The
!

last such written contract was executed by the parties on or about 29 September 1997, and has
continued through the present.
5.

; Although the contract(s) required Defendant to provide other legal services on

demand for the Tax Assessor and Tax Collector, the primary service Defendant provided under
the contract ~as to take appropriate action to collect delinquent accounts submitted to him by the
I

Tax Collector for payment of property taxes on real property. The contract contained no
provisiop indicating that the County wished to purchase property on which taxes were
delinquent. :
6.

Upon SUbmission of the delinquent accounts to him by the Tax Collector for

collection, Defendant first regularly and routinely sent notices to those delinquent taxpayers
demanding p~yment and informing them that their property would be sold at public sale if the
taxes were liotpaid.
I

its contract with Defendant.
9.

Defendant had an obllgatioll to the County to bring the foreclosure action and

I

provisions governing the sale of the land through the tax foreclosure.

instructions of the Tax Collector, Defenclant regularly and routinely entered ~ protective bid on
behalf of the County for the amount of taxes due and the cost~ of collection, including his
Commissioner's fee, anci no other bid for the County. The County has never instructed the
Defendant to' purchase property on its behalf at a foreclosure, rather only.to make 'R minimum
protective bid and no other bid.
11.

taxes owed on property belonging to Howard Heidenberg (Heide11berg) to Defendant for

I

collection. Th~ Heidenberg property was a lot identified as lot 39 (hereafter "lot 39") in the

until July 2000, when the account was selected for foreclosure through a randolll selection

I

process that had been in existence at his law office. On 20 July 2000, Defendant filed an action
to con4uct a tax foreclosure sale on the Heidenberg property. The action was filed in the Pender

I

been filed, that the Heidenberg property was adjacent to his own property.
18.

Defendant's part-time employee, Doris Carlton (Carlton), was the only person.

other-than Defendant who ,attended the sale. Carlton had a business of buying properties at
foreclosure sales and very frequently had attended tax foreClosure sales to buy properties with
the intent to resell them. Defendant and Carlton walked together to the sale from Defendant's
office. On the way to the sale, Carlton spoke to the Defendant about the property and the fact
that the property was adjacent to Defendant;s property at lot 38 in Belve4ere. Carlton suggested.
that Defendant bid on the property himself. Defendant said he would not do that. Defendant
informed Carlton th~t he would like to acquire the property from her if nobody else entered a bid. '

protective bid of$1,016.12 on behalf of the County for the minimum due to cover the taxes and
expenses of the

!
entered at the sale. Carlton's bid was the high bid. Defendant reported Carlton's bid as the high
bid to the coUrt on the day of the sale, 15 November 2000.
20.

Carlton informed Defendant that she would convey the property t6 Defendant for

I

the amount of
, her bid before Defendant confirmed the sale to Carlton to the Court. At the end of
th~ upset bid period on 28 Noveinbe~ 2000, Defendant certified to the court that Carlton was the

I

highest bidder on the property in the amount of$I,017.00. The Court confirmed the sale of the

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the hearing committee makes the following:
Conclusions of Law
1.

All parties· are properiy before the hearing committee and the committee has

jurisdiction over the Defendant and the subject matter of this proceeding.

I

2.

The Defendant's conduct, as set out

in

the Findings .of Fact above, constitutes

grounds for discipline pursuant to N. C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28(b)(2) as follows:
(a)

By privately purchasing property for hi~ own benefit from delinquent taxpayers at

a time when he was seeking payment for delinquent taxes as attorney for the Tax Collector
without disclosing the transaction to the County beforehand, Defendant engaged in conduct at·
that time in which the interests of his client may have been materially limitecl by his personal
interests in violation of Rule 5.1(b) of the Superceded Rules of Professional Conduct;

(b)

By acquiring the Hei4enberg property for his own benefit from his employee aft~r

his employee purchased the property at a foreclosure sale at which h~ wa~ the commissioner,
Defendant engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in viol~tion of Rule
8.4(d);
(c)

By failing to disclose to his client that he had acquired the Heidenberg property

from the highest bidder, Defendant engaged in conduct in which the interests of his client.may

I

have been materially limited by his own personal interests in violation o~Rule 1.7(b); and
(d)

By failing to dis.close to the court that he had acquired the Heidenberg property

from the highest bidder, his employee, whom he had also certified to the court as Commissioner
as the high bidder at the tax foreclosure sale, Defendant engaged in conduct prejudicial to the
administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d).
Based upon the consent of the parties, the hearing committee also enters the following:
Findings Of Fact Regarding Discipline
1.

Both the Sameckys and the Mattisons conveyed their properties to the Defendant

freely ~d voluntarily. There is no evidence that either

party w~ misled about the value of their

properties by Defendant or that Defendant coerced them into selling 'their properties to him.

2.

At some time no later than the early 1990's, Defendant investigated whether he or

an employe~ in his office could purchase property subject to tax foreclosure. He conducted
research, spQke with other local attorneys, and spoke with his: State Bar Councilor. He also made
,

an informal telephone inquiry to a representative of the North Carolina State Bar about whether
there was any ethical problem with either his employee or him submitting a bid at a tax
foreclosure sale that he was conducting. Based solely on his understanding of his conversation

I

with the representative of the. State Bar as well as his other efforts, Defendant believed in good
faith that both he and hls employees could submit bids at a tax foreciosure sale without violating
the ethics ruies that existed at the time. Defendant did not attempt t6 obtain any confinnation of
his underst~ding of the opinion in Writing from the State Bar not did h~ make any new inquiry
after the adoption of the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct in 1997. He did infonn the local
State Bar CQuncilor, other counsel, and the County Attorney about his conversation with the
representative of the State Bar and the opinion that he had received.
3.

: At the time of his inquiry to the State Bar, and continuing through the time when

asked to respond to the Grievance Committee inquiry in this matter, the Defendant was unaware
!

of a.North CfU"olina case, Hinson v. Morgan, 225 N.C. 740, 36 S.E.2d 266 (1945), stating that "a
I

commission$r appointed in a judicial proceeding to sell land may not purchase [that land] at his
own sale, eV~i1 ifhe acts fairly.;' The case is not indexed as a tax sale case in the published North
Carolina legal index.
4.

i

I

Defendant 'noW recognizes the legal and ethical problems with his conduct and

had voltl11tarily agreed to stop engaging in such conduct before this action was brought. Further,
the County has since adopted policies that prohibit such future conduct.
I

5.

.

Defendat).t has agreed to offer to reconvey the Heidenberg property to the

Heidenbergs for the amount he has paid in property taxes since his acquisition, not to exceed
$500.00.
6.

Defendant's conduct generated adverse and negative publicity against his client,

Pender County.

Based on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the additional

Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Committee makes the following:
Conclusions With Respect To Discipline
1.

I
2.

I

The defendant's conduct is aggravated by the following factors:

A.

Multiple offenses;

B.

Motivation of personal, fmancial gain; and

C.

Substantial experience in the practice.oflaw.

The defendant's conduct is mitigated by the following factors:
A.

Absence of any prior disciplinary record;

B.

Cooperative attitude toward the proceedings;

C.

Restitution in the form of the reconveyance of the Heidenberg property;

D.

Remorse that his acquisitions caused his client unwanted critical media
scrutiny;

E.

The alleged offenses occurring in the mid-1990's are remote; and

F.

His client suffered no loss.

3.

The mitigating factors substantially outweigh the aggravating factors.

4.

Based on the mitigating factors, the Defendant's good faith belief in the propriety

of his conduct, the Defendant's recognition ofthe ethical prohibitions to his conduct, and
Defendant's commitment to refrain from such future conduct, entry of an order imposing
di~cipline greater than a reprimand is unnecessary to protect the public from potential futtJre

transgressions by Defendant. However, entry of an order ofless than a reprimand would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses committed by Defendant and' would send the wrong
message to attorneys regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar in this State.
