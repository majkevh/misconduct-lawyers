Defendant
This matter was heard on January 10, 2014 before a Hearing Panel of the
Disciplinary Hearing Commission ("DHC") composed of Steven D. Michael, Chair, and
members Donald C. Prentiss and Percy L. Taylor. Plaintiff was represented by G. Patrick
Murphy. Defendant, Robert W. Adams ("Adams" or "Defendant"), was represented by

against Defendant leaving as the sole issue what, if any, discipline was appropriate for the

14.
On May 24, 2012, Alltel attempted to draft approximately $1,458.98 from
TA 6177. At that time, TA 6177 had insufficient funds to cover the Alltel draft and a
notice of non-sufficient funds was issued by Bank of Granite.
15.
Between December 31, 2011 and July 30, 2012, Defendant did not
conduct quarterly reconciliations ofTA 6177.

-4-

16.
Defendant did not maintain a ledger containing a record of receipts and
disbursements for each person or entity from whom and for who funds were received and
showing the current balance of entrusted funds held in TA 6177 for each such person or
entity.
17.
The State Bar is unaware of any evidence that client funds were
misappropriated by the Defendant.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Hearing Panel concludes as a matter
of law, the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Defendant's foregoing actions constitute grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C.
Gen. Stat. § 84-28(b)(2) in that Defendant violated the Rules of Professional Conduct in
effect at the time of the conduct as follows:
a.

By depositing SSA checks in payment of his attorney's fee into TA 6177,
Defendant failed to maintain entrusted property separate from the property
of the lawyer in violation of Rule 1.15-2(a) and Rule 1.15-2(f);

b.

By failing to promptly disburse his earned fees from TA 6177, instead
leaving them commingled with client funds, Defendant failed to maintain
entrusted funds separate from the property of the lawyer in violation of
Rule 1.15-2(a) and Rule 1.15-2(f);

c.

By failing to ensure the checks drawn on TA 6177 noted in paragraph 12
above showed the client balance against which the check was drawn,
Defendant violated Rule 1.15-2(h) and Rule 1.15-3(b)(2);

d.

By failing to maintain a record related to the electronic transfers from TA
6177 listed in paragraph 13 above showing the name of the client or other
person to whom the funds belong, Defendant violated Rule 1.15-3(b)(3);

e.

By failing to reconcile TA 6177 quarterly, the Defendant violated Rule
1.15-3(d)(1); and

f.

By failing to maintain a ledger containing a record of receipts and
disbursements for each person or entity from whom and for who funds
were received and showing the current balance of funds held in T A 6177
for each such person or entity, Defendant violated Rule 1.15-3(b)(5).
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
The State Bar conducted two prior random audits of TA 6177, one in 1996
and the second in 2008. Both audits disclosed deficiencies in Defendant's trust account
management practices.

-5-

2.
Among other deficiencies, both random audits disclosed that at the time of
the audits Defendant: 1) did not maintain ledgers for each person or entity from whom or
for who trust money was received; and 2) did not conduct quarterly reconciliations.
3.
After the 1996 random audit, Defendant wrote to the State Bar agreeing to
correct the deficiencies in his trust account management practices including maintaining
a ledger and conducting quarterly audits; however, those same deficiencies, as well as the
others noted above, continued in the present proceeding.
4.
Defendant's mismanagement of his trust account resulted in numerous
violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.
5.
Alltel Wireless drafts appear on the January 2012 through May 2012 bank
statements of T A 6177. Although Defendant maintains the Alltel drafts were not
authorized by him, he had several months to take action with Bank of Granite to block
the drafts but failed to do so.
6.
The attempt by Alltel to draft $1,458.98 from TA 6177 on May 24, 2012
failed because TA 6177, though containing entrusted funds,. had insufficient funds to
cover the Alltel draft.

7.

The Alltel draft on TA 6177 created the potential for significant harm to
clients of Defendant with entrusted funds in TA 6177.
8.
Defendant's failure to comply with the State Bar's regulations related to
his trust account has the potential to cause significant harm to clients of Defendant and to
the public's perception of the legal profession.
9.
Defendant has received prior discipline by the Grievance Committee and
the DHC, as follows: 90G0044 - Reprimand (noting deficiencies in handling entrusted
funds); 93G0814 and 93G0904 - Admonition; 96G0320 - Reprimand; 96G1329 and
96G1345 - Censure; 97DHC27 - Stayed suspension (2 years); 00DHC1- Suspension (3
years with all but nine months stayed).
10.
Defendant has substantial experience, approximately 40 years, in the
practice oflaw.
11.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it, including an admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and
disbarment, in considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
Based on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B §.01l4(w)(1) of the Rules and Regnlations of the North

-6-

Carolina State Bar and concludes the following factors warrant suspension of
Defendants' license:
a. Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential harm is
foreseeable;
b. Circumstances reflecting the Defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness,
or integrity;
c. Negative impact of Defendant's actions on client's or public's perception
of the legal profession; and
d. Multiple instances of failure to participate in the legal profession's selfregulation process.
2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.CAC. 1B §.0114(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes that the factors present in this case do not require disbarment.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.CAC. 1B §.0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
a. Prior disciplinary offenses;
b. Remoteness of some prior offenses;
c. A pattern of misconduct;
d. Multiple offenses;
e. Cooperative attitude with the State Bar investigation;
f.

Defendant has good character and reputation as a professional attorney in
the 25 th District;

g. Defendant did not contest the entry of default or the findings of the
violations by the Hearing Panel; and
h. Substantial experience, approximately 40 years, in the practice of law.
4.
Defendants' misconduct resulted in potential siguificant hann to his
clients by placing entrusted client funds at risk of misapplication and misappropriation.

-7-

5.
Defendant's failure to properly maintain, manage and handle entrusted
funds betrays a vital trust that clients and the public place in attorneys and the legal
profession.
6.
The Hearing Panel has considered issuing an admonition, reprimand or
censure but concludes that such discipline would not be sufficient discipline because of
the factors noted in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this section and the gravity of the potential
significant harm to the clients. The Panel further concludes that such discipline would
fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses committed by Defendant and send the
wrong message to attorneys regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar in this
State.
7.
This Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and concludes that a
suspension is appropriate under the facts and circumstances of this case to address the
potential for significant harm to Defendant's clients, and for the protection of
Defendant's clients and the public.
8.
For these reasons, this Hearing Panel finds that an order imposing
discipline less than a suspension of Defendant's law license would not be appropriate.
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law and the findings
of fact and conclusion regarding discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1.
