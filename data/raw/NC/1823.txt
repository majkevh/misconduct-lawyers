This public censure is issued to you pursuant to Section 14
(H) of the Discipline and Disbarment Procedures of the North
Carolina Sta1te Bar and the Consent Order of the Disciplinary
Hearing Committee of the Disciplinary Hearing Commission entered
on the 23rd day of February 1995, which order was based on
stipulated Fiirtdings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.
In March of 1993, Arthur Frank Harrison, Jr. hired you and
your law part-ner, Curtis Roqgers, to represent him in an appeal
of a federal criminal conviction to the Fourth,Circuit of
Appeals. Harrison paid you and Rodgers a total of $5,000 to
~epresent him on appeal.
You 'received $2,500 of the $5,000.
In
May 1993, Harrison was sentenced to prison and notice of appeal
was given.
In SeptembeJ;:" 1993, 'Harrison discharged you and
Rodgers as his attorneys and requested an accounting of the money
you had earned and a refund of the unused portion. You failed to
provide Harrison with a refund or an accounting of the time you

Harrison hired Jeffrey Miller of Greepville to pursue his
appeal. Miller requested that ybu provide him with all documents
in the file.: The only document you provided ~tIiller was the

By failing to render an appropriate accounting of the time
you expended in Harrison's case, you violated Rule 10.2(D) of the
Rules of Professional Conduct. Secondly, by failing to promptly
