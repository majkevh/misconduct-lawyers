ORDER OF DISBARMENT

THIS MATTER was heard by the Council of the North Carolina State Bar
pursuant to 27 N.CAC. 1B §.0117 (a) of the State Bar Discipline and Disability Rules
upon the affidavit of tender of surrender of license executed by Joseph W. Morton on
June 6, 2006, and filed in the offices of the State Bar on June 16, 2005.
Based on the affidavit, the Council finds that Joseph W. Morton, whose practice
consisted primarily of District Court traffic cases, abandoned his law practice resulting in
a substantial number of clients who paid Morton fees and costs, but for whom Morton
either did not appear in court or did not pay the court costs on their tickets. This
conduct constitutes grounds for discipline, under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28 (b)(2), in that
Morton violated Rules 1.15 through 1.15-3 and Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.16, and 8.4(d) and (g)
of the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct.
WHEREFORE, upon motion made and duly seconded, the Council enters the
following Order:
1. The tender of surrender of the license of Joseph W. Morton is hereby
accepted.
2. Joseph W. Morton hereby is DISBARRED from the practice of law in North
Carolina.
3. Joseph W. Morton shall comply with the provisions of 27 NCAC 1B § .0124 of
the State Bar Discipline and Disability Rules and shall surrender her license and
permanent membership card to the Secretary of the North Carolina State Bar
along with the affidavit required by 27 NCAC 1B § .0124 of the State Bar
Discipline and Disability Rules.
4. The costs of this action are taxed against Joseph W. Morton.
Done and ordered this the 21 5t day of July, 2006.

2. My resignation is freely and voluntarily rendered. It is not the result of

coercion or duress. I am fully aware of the implication of submitting my resignation.

3. I am aware that there is a pending investigation by the State Bar regarding

allegations that by mid-200S I effectively abandoned my law practice (consisting mainly

of representing well over one hundred clients on traffic matters in District Court) by

accepting fees to protect my clients' interests but either not appearing in court on behalf

of many clients or failing to pay court costs that I held in trust on behalf of many clients.
