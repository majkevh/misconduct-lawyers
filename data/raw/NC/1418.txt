1.

The Plaintiff i ·the North Carolina State Bar, is a body duly
organiz~ unde+ the laws of North Carolina and wa,s ~he prqper
party to bring ~is proceeqing under the authority granted it
in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, and
the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar
promulgated thepeunder.

2.

The Defendant, Edward L. Bullard" Jr., was admitted to the
North Carolina ,$tate Bar in 1980 anq is and was at all tUnes
referred to herein, an Attorney at Law, l,icensed to practice
law in the State of North Carolina subject ·to the Rules,
Regulations, and Code of Professional Responsibility of the

Incident to the transaction descril;>ed above, :t;.heDafendant·
disbursed 'the loan proceeds through the issuance of several
trust account checks to various payees' in amounts specifiec!!' 001

check, number 0317 in the amount of $14,305'·•. 88, was ·issuedand
delivered to J. T. Davenport to payoff an existing 1Q~.

Shortly thereafter; Davenport deposited the .check in his
account at Southern Na·tional Bank. Although .Davenport'·s
account received full credit: for the total amount of the check,
the instrument was subsequently underencoded Py' pouthern .

$14;000.00 in the ,trust account, which represented ·theextent.
to which the accounts of $outhern Nat~ona1B~ wer~theh' out·.

In late March, 1984, the Defendant <Uscovered the..errQl: and the
presenqe of $14,000 in his trust account to wht¢hhe 'kpewhe: .
was not entit1ed~ After making this discoverY, the Dsfenqant .
took no action to determine the ownetship Qf itlie ripney~, but·,'·
rather, permitted it to reID?l·j,.n in his trust account sO, it WQulq,
be available to him if needed to pay personal 6b1~gat];ons'..

9.

Although the '));fendantwas involved in several 'cas$$. wh~ch··he.
expected to pz;-oduce cOJ1,siderab1e fees during the .spring o~·
1984, he was disappointed by the inabilitY'of-severalclients

All ,of the subject money rema~ned in the t~st ·acGount~nt~l
May, 1984, when the Defendant began using it to sa~isfy
personal obligations. !he Defendant \lsed ~1 0, 660.,00 of the'
money for his own purposes.

The Defendant has not been the subject of

14.

The fact that the Defendant vdluntarily admitted and rectified
his misconduct prior to the initiation of the State Bar's
investigation is a significant mitigating circumstance and
justifies a diSCiplinary sanction less severe than. disbannent,
which is orq.ina~ilY warranted in misappropriation cases.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Committee makes the
following Conclusj.ons of ;Law,.
The Il9fendant, by intentionally misappropriating funds held ~n ohis q::ust
account" engaged in 'Conduct involving ,dishonesty and engaged in conduct which
adversely reflects on 'his: fitness to practice law in violation of Disciplinaxy
RUles 1-102(A){4) and (6):, respectively, of the North Carolina Code of
