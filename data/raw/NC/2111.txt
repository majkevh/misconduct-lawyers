28. Siskind has not paid anytl}ing toward satisfying the Westbrook Estate's
judgment, despite his income which has ranged from $30,000.00 to $46,000.00 over the
past six years. Siskind never contacted Walker to talk about a payment arrangement in
the six years that the judgment has been docketed against him.
29. Siskind represented an elderly woman named Tensie Jones in the mid to late
1980's in Ashe CotjIlty. Ms. Jones held Siskind in high regard artd often invited him
and ,his family into her hqme.

I

30. Siskind told Ms, Jones that he would invest $16,000.00 of her money. He
received a check for $16,000.0() dated December 22, 1989 drawn on Ms. Jones' bank
account.
31. Siskind did not invest the $16,000.00 for Ms. Jones. He embezzled her
money and used it to pay back the mo:pey he had stolen from Ralph Colvard.
32. InJanuary 1990, Siskind returned $14,608.98 of the $1,6,000.00 that he stole
from Ms. Jones. Sjskind owed a balance of$I,391.02 to Ms. Jones. However, when Ms.
Jones died in January of 1992, Siskind had not fully reimbursed Ms. Jones for her loss.
33. Ms. Jones' estate requested that Siskind pay 'the balance of the $16,000.00
that he embezzled. The evidence showed that when the Jones' Estate's 'lawyer, Gregory
I
Luck, contacted Siskind about repaying $1,391.02, Siskind lied about what he did with
the $16,~00.00 and about who was entitled to the $1,391.02.

Gregory Luck, the Jones Estate's lawyer, or its execu~i.~, Alene Purden, about making

36. Restitution is an important factor in determining whether a disbarred lawyer
has reforqled br rehabilitated.
37. Siskind also testified that he obtained $10,000 from Ms. Jones in December
of 1989. Siskind told Ms. Jones that he would invest the money for her, but he actually
used it for his own purposes without Ms. Jones' knowledge or permission. Siskind repaid
the $10,000.00 to Ms. jones before she died.
38. Siskind testified that he had not apologized to the victims of his
embe,zzlements: Ralph Colvard, William S. Westbrook, Sr., the,administrator of the
Tholl}~s Westbrook Estate, and Alene Purden, the executrix of the Tensie Jones Estate.

Based upon the foregoing findings, a majority ofthe . hearing committee (two to
one) concludes as ~()llows:
a. Siskind has not proven by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that he has
reformed and presently possesses the moral qualifications required for admission to
practice law in Nort.h Carolina.
b. :Siskind has not proven by clear, cogent and convincing evidelJ,ce that resuming
the practice of law in North Carolina will not be detrimental to the integrity and standing
of the bar, to the administration 'of justice; or to the public interest.
c. Siskind has satisfied his burden of proof regarding the other requirements of
Section .OI2S(a)(3)(A) and (B), (E) through (N) and Section .OI2S(a)(4)(A).
THEREFORE, a majority of the hearing committee recommends that the law
license ~f John P. Siskind not be reins~ated. Siskind shall pay the costs of this
proceeding, including deposition costs incurred by the North Carolina State Bar.

7. On Feb. 6, 1998, Dr. Kenneth A. Podger, Jr. (hereafter, Dr. Podger), was
arrested and charged ~th driving while impaire~ (DWl) in Durham, N.C.
8. Prior to Dr. Podger's arrest, Durham police Officers Mike Evans and R. A.
Wiggins (hereaftet Officer Evans and Officer Wiggins) observed Dr. Podger operating a
Highway 147 in Durham. Officers Evans and Wiggins detained Dr. Podger
vehicle
after they saw Dr. Podger's vehicle skid and spin aroUnd in the northbound lane of
Highway 147.

on

9. After detaining Dr. Podger, Officer Wiggins administered several field
sobriety tests to Dr. Podger, all of which Dr. Podger failed.
10. After Officers Evans and Wiggins stopped Dr. Podger, a third police officer,
Officer Terry Cullinan, (hereafter, Officer Cullinan), re~ponded to their call for
assistance. Upon Officer Cullinan's arrival, he arrested Dr. Podger and Officers Evans
and Wiggins left the scene. Officer Cullinan recognized Dr. Podger has his personal

14. Within a weel! or two after Dr. Podger's Feb. 6, 1998 arrest, Covington
und~rtook to represent Dr. Podger respecting the 1998 OWl charges.

1'5.

Shortly after Dr. Podger retained Covington to represent him respecting the
1998 DWl charge, Covington told Dr. Podge! that Covington was a close friend of Jim
Hardin (Hardin), the elected District Attorney in the 14th Judicial Di~trict. Covington
indicated that if anybody could do anything for Dr. podger in his current circumstances,
that Covington could, ,by virtue of his relationship to lfardin.

I

16. Covington also told Dr. Podger that there were "ways around" the OWl
charge pending against Dr. Podger and that it was possible that some favorable result
might b~ achieved in the case. Covington further stated that if the case "worked out" as '
hoped, Dr. Podget would be pleased and that he should be "grateful." Dr. Podger
interpreted this remark to mean that Covington desired him to make sollie contribution to
Hardin.
17. In the spring of 1998, Covington conferred with Qfficer Evans and Officer
Cullinan about Dr. Podger's arrest. Covington was therefore aware that only Officer
Evans and Officer Wiggins had seen Dr. Podger drive. Covington also acknowledged to
Officer Evans that the state had had probable cause to stop Dr. Podger on Feb. 6, 1998.
I

.

18. Covington asked Officer Evans ifhe would be displeased if Covington
resolved Dr. Poc;lger's case without Officer Evans being present., Officer Evans stated
that he did not have a problem with that, but that he (Officer Evans) would appear in
court if he was subpoenaed to appear.
"
.
19. In July 1998, Covington met with Strickland, who Was then an Assistant
District Attorney in the 14th Judicial District and was chiefly responsible for the
negotiation of traffic matters in district court. Covington told Strickland that he
,represented Dr. Podger and that Dr. Podger was facing his second OWl charge in seven .
years. Covington also told Strickland that Podger had "spun out" on tiw Durham freeway
and that he had blown a .15 on the breathalyzeJ; test following his Feb. 6, 1998 arrest.

I

20. During the July 1998 meeting, Covington asked Strickland to dismiss the
DWl charge against Dr. Podger and permit Dr. Podger to plead to a charge of careless
and reckless dI'iving. Strickland declined this request.
21. Nevertheless, .Stricklandadvised Covington that Durham County District
Court Judg~ Craig Brown (hereafter, Brown) ha4 recently entered ajudgment of careless
and reckless driving following the trial of a OWl case involving a Duke professor named
Debraeckleer, despite the fact that Debrackleer was not charged with careless and
reckless driving~ Strickh1l1d also agreed that CQvington could request Judge Brown to
hear Dr. Podger's OWl case.

22. At the time of the July 1998 meeting and conversation, Strickland and
Covington were aWare that careless and reckless driving was not a lesser included offense
ofDWI. Both were also knew that Judge Brown could not properly enter a judgment of
careless and reckless driving in Dr. Podger's case, unless the state dismissed the DWI
charge and filed a n~w misdemeanor statement of charges against Dr. PodgeI'.
23. Strickland, Covington and Beasley were aware that it was the written policy
of James ~ardin, the District Attorney of the 14th Judicial District (hereafter, Hardin), not
to "break down" any DWI cases in which the defendant's Qlood alcohol level at the time
of arrest exceeded .09. It was ruso, Hardin's policy to require his staff to try all DWI
cases in which the defendant had a prjor DWI conviction, even if it was obvious that the
state could not win the case owing to a flaw in the state's evidence., Beasley had no
authority ,to "break down" any DWI case.

'"

I

24. In late August 1998, William C. Fleming Jr. (hereafter, Fleming) joined
Covington's law firm as an associate. In the first day or two of Fleming's employment
with Covington's firm, Covington bragged to Fleming of Covington's close friendships
with Hardin and Brown. Covington also instructed 'Fleming to tell potential new clients
that Covington had an "in" with the DA's office and could therefore "g~t things done" in
criminal cases that other lawyers Were unable to accomplish.
'
, 25. On Sept. 1, 1998, at Covington' request, Fleming accompanied Covington to
'
the Durham County Courthouse.
26. While at the courthouse, Covington sought out Judge Brown and asked to
discuss a matter with him. During this conversation, which took place in a hall outside a
courtroom, Covington told Judge Brown that he represented a dentist named Dr. Podget
who had been charged with DWI earlier in 1998 after "spinning out" on the Durham
Freeway. Covington stated that Dr. Podger had pled guilty to a DWI charge in 1994,
although he had had a blood alcohol level of .08 'in the prior case. Covington asked
Judge Brown to hear Dr. Podger's case on Thursday, Sept. 3, and to impose ajudginent
of careless and reckless driving in the pending DWI case. Covington suggested that Dr.
Podger should have been permitted to plead to careless'and reckless driving in the earlier
case and that it would therefore be equitable to enter a judgment of careless and reckless
driving in the 1998 case. Covington indicated that he had spoken to the District
Attorney's staff and that they did not object to the imposition of a judgment of careless
and reckless driving.

I

27. Covlp.gton further advised Judge Brown that Podger was a rich dentist, that
he had paid a "huge fee" in the pending DWI case and that if Judge Brown convicted Dr.
Podger of careless and reckless driving only, a part of the fee would "flow to the
appropriate campaigns." Fleming interpreted that statement to meah that part of the fee
paid by Dr. Podger would be donated to political campaigns for Hardin.and/or Judge
Brown. After this discussion, Judge Brown agreed to hear the Dr. Podger caSe on
Thursday, Sept. 3, 1998 and to find Dr. Podger guilty of careless and reckless driving.

28. Although he was originally assigned to traffic court for the week of Aug. 31 Sept. 4, 1998, Judge Brown was re-assigned to domestic violence court for that week and
a visiting judge waS assigned to traffic court.
29. After the hallway conversation with Judge Brown; Covington and Fleming
proceeded to Strickland's office. Be~ley, who was an Assistant District Attorney in the
14th Judicial District primarily assigned to traffic court, was present in Strickland's office
for at least a portion of the conversation.
30. Covington told Strickland that Judge Brown had agr~ed to hear Dr. Podger's
case at noon on Sept. 3, 1998. Strickland asked CQvington who the State's witness
would be. Covington told him that the State would call the arresting officer on the scene
as the witness in the case. This step would leave missing a vital link in th~ state's case
against Dr. Podger, since Officer Cullinan had not witnessed Dr. Podger drive on the
night of his arrest. Strickland agreed that Covington would be responsible for getting the
State's witness to the hearing on Sept. 3.

I

31. Beasley offered to handle the Podger case for the State, whereupon Strickland
told him that he might not want to do it becauSe the case was one which Be~ley "would
have to lose."
. 32. Between January 1998 when he began work at the District Attorney's Office
and September 1998, the only DWI cases which Strickland had tried were those matters
which the State could not win, owing to a fatal defect in the State's case. Because of the
District Attorney's policy regarding OWl cases, it was Strickland's practice to call these
cases, sometimes referred to as "losers," for trial and permit the judge to dismiss the case
against the defendant. .
.
33. As of September 1998, Beasley had been employed with the Durham County
District Attorney's office for approximately 11 months. During that time period he had
been chiefly responsible for handling traffic cases in district court and had tried
approximately 160 -,. 180 DWI cases.

1

34. After leaving Strickland's office, Covington invited Fleming to accompany
him to the office of Ann Robinson, the secretary for the Superior Court judges in Durham
County.
35. Covington inquired into Ms. Robinson's health and she· responded that she
was in considerable pain and stated that she "could use some Valium."
36. Covington told Ms. Robblson that he would obtain some Valium for her,
whereupon he telephoned Upchurch's Drugstore and asked the pharmacist on duty to
prepare 6 or 8 dosages of Valium and to charge it to his (Covington's) bill. Covington
indicated that the Valium was for a friend and stated that Ms. Robinsonwould come by
later in the day to pick up the Valium.

37. Covington ordered the Valium with the intent and purpose of giving the
Valium to Ms. Robinson.
38. After ordering the Valium from Upchurch's Pharmacy, Covington telephoned
his personal physician, Dr. Eugene Wright, and asked Dr. Wright to telephone
Upchurch's Pharmacy to authorize the prescription for the Valium. Covington did not
tell Dr. Wright that Covington intended to give the Valium to Ms. Robinson or any other
individual.
39. Ms. Robinson was nota patient of Dr. Wright's and Dr. Wright would not
have telephoned in a prescrip.tion for the Valium ifhe had known the medication was for
someone· other than Covington.
40. On the morning of Sept. 2, 1998, Fleming telephoned Carl Fox; the elected
District Attorney in District 15B, for whom Fleming had worked while Fleming was in
law school. Fleming told Fox what he had seen at the Durham County Courthouse on
Sept. 1, 1998 and sought Fox's advice concerning the appropriate course of conduct.
41. At Fox's suggestion, Fleming reported what he had witnessed on Sept. 1,
1998 to the State Bureau ofInvestigation (SBI). The SBI began an investigation of the
matter and suggested that Fleming accompany Covington to court on Sept. 3, 1998 When
Dr. Podg¢r's case was set for resolution.
42. On the morning of Sept. 3, 1998, Covington told Fleming to come with him
"to see a bogus trial." Fleming a.ccompanied Covington and Dr. Podger to the Durham
County Courthouse.
43. Podger's case did not appear on any trial calendar for Sept. 3, 1998 and that
day was not a regular court date for Officers Evarts, Wiggins or Cullinan. In fact, the
Podger case Was calendared for Sept. 14, 1998. .
44. Although Covington contacted Officer Cullinan and subpoenaed him to court
on Sept. 3, none of the defendants subpoenaed Officer Evarts or Officer Wiggins to court
on Sept. 3, nor did any of the defendants herein advise Wiggins or Evans that the Podger
case would be resolved on Sept. 3.

I

45. Covington, Dr. Podger and Fleming went to the Domestic Violence
courtroom where Juudge Brown was holding court, and approached the bench.
Covington reminded Judge Brown about the Podger case and stated that Judge Brown
was "going to find Podger guilty of careless and reckless driving, fine him $1,000 and
give him 48 hours of community service."
46. Following this conversation, Covington sent Fleming to seatch for Strickland,
who had not yet appeared. Fleming found Strickland and Beasley on the second floor
and reminded them that the Podger case waS ready to be resolved. Srickland advised
that he or Beasley would be up shortly.

47. While they were awaiting for Strickland or Beasley to appear, Dr. Podger
approached Officer Cullinan .and offered him a discount on future dental services.
Officer Cullinan declined the offer.
"

48. Shortly thereafter, Beasley appeared in Judge Brown's courtroom and
requested time to find the shuck relating to Dr. Podger's case and to speak with Officer
Cullinan, who had arrived in court at the same time a~ Covington and Fleming.
50. While searching for the shuck and speaking with Officer Cullinan Beasley
learned that Dr. Podget's case was calendared for Sept. 14, not Sept. 3, and that Officer
Cullinan was only the charging officer and had not seen Dr. Podger. drive on the night of .
Dr. Podger's arrest,

1

"

.

51. After Beasley returned to the Domestic Violence courtroom, Covington told
him he did not need the shuck to dispose of the Podger case. Following this
conversatio~; Judge Brown left the bench and asked the participants in the Podget case to
join him in the hall behind the courtroom. Covingto~, 'Fleming, Beasley, Officer
Cullinan and Dr. Podger followed Judge Brown into the hallway.
52. While in the hallway, Covington identified for Judge Brown the 'individuals
who were present ancJ gave a brief summary of the facts of the Feb. 6, 1998 arrest.
. Covington pointed out that Officer Cullinan had not seen Dr. Podger drive bqt that Dr.
Podger was willing to accept some responsibility in the case and therefore would not
oppose a judgment of careless and reckless driving.
53. Beasley indicated that the Stat~ did not object to Covington's proposal.
Beasley did not attempt to call Officer EVanS or Officer Wiggins nor did he object to
proceeding with Dr. Podger's case on a date on which it was not scheduled and in the
absence of an essential witness.
54. Judge Brown then entered ~ order finding Podgerguilty of careless and
reckless driving, fined him $1,000 and ordered him to perform 48 hours of community
service.

1

55. With the exception of the conference at the be.nch, all of the proceedings
before Judge Brown regarding Dr. Podger's 1998 DWI occurred in tne hallway outside
Courtroom 402, and not in open court.
.
56. No sworn testimony was give~ and no court reporter or courtroom clerk was
present during the proceedings.
.
57. The jucJgment entered in Podger's case reflects that the DWI charge against
Podger was voluntarily dismissed, althollgh there was no signed di~missal in the file and
.
no indication that the State in fact dismissed the charge. The file does not contain ~
misdemeanor statement of charges for careless and reckless driving.

58. Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 20-138.4, the State is requited to file a detailed
explanation concerning the reasons for a reduction or dismissal of a cbarge involving
impaired driving. Although Strickland and Beasley were aware of this requirement, no
such explanation was provided in the Podget case.
59. Reckless driving'is not a lesser included offense of driving while impaired
and Covington, Strickland and Beasley were each aware that a judge could not legally
. find a d~fendant charged with DWlguilty of careless and reckless driving.
60. After Dr. Podger's cas~ was resolved in the hallway of the Durham County
Courthouse, Covington told Fleming that this Was the "kind of deal that everyone must
keep quiet." Covingtonn also cautioned Dr~ Podger not to discuss'the outcome of the
case.

I

61. The disposition of the Podger case in a hallway of the Durham County
Courthouse was designed to and had the effect of improperly removing the proceeding
from the public domain.
62. After the disposition of the Podger case in the hallway of the Durham County
Courthouse, Covington advised' Podger that Podger owed him an additional fee of
$9,000.' Podger later paid this amount to Covington. Podger had previously paid
Covington a $1,000 retainer.
.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Hearing COinmittee, makes the
following
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DEFENDANT COVINGTON

1. By arranging and participating in the disposition ofPodger's DWI case in the
back hall of the Durham County Courthouse rather than in. open court, and by arranging
the absence of a material witness to the Podger case, Covington engaged in conduct
prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d) of the Revised
Rules of Professional CondUCt.
2. By arranging and participating in the resolution ofPodger's DWI caSe
by the entry of a judgment of careless & reckless driving in contravention of
the normal judicial process for the purpose of obtaining a large fee, Covington engaged in
conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d) and
engaged in dishonest conduct in violation of Rule 8.4(c) of the Revised Rules of
Professional Conduct.
3. 'By requesting and facilitating the entry of a judgment of careless and reckless
driving in,Podger's DWI case When the State had not taken a dismissal of the DWI
charges and had not charged Podger with careless and reckless driving, Covington

assisted a judge in co~duct that is' a violation of applicable rUles of judicial conductor
other law, in violation of Rule 8A(t) of the Revised Rules of Rules of Professional
Conduct.
'
5. By obtaining Valium, a Schedule IV controlled substance, by falsely telling
his physician that the Valium, was for his own us~ when in fact Covington intended to
distribute it to and did in fact distribute the Valium to a third party, Ann Robinson,
Covington engaged in conduct involving misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c) of
the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct.

I
