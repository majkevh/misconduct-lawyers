5.
In 2014, Dr. Phillip Greene ("Greene") pursued a professional malpractice
claim against Defendant and Donlon Law, PLLC.
6.

Greene was represented by Moore and Van Allen, PLLC ("MVA").

7.
In January 2015, Greene voluntarily dismissed the action against Defendant
without prejudice.
8.
Following the dismissal of the lawsuit, Defendant sent several emails to MVA
seeking reimbursement for his legal fees in defending the Greene lawsuit.
9.
In May 2015, the MVA attomey of record in the Greene lawsuit, Josh Lanning,
informed Defendant that Greene would not pay Defendant's legal fees.
10.
In June 2015, Defendant requested a meeting with MYA's managing member,
Emie Reigel ("Reigel"), to discuss Greene's lawsuit and the costs thereofto Defendant.
11.

Reigel declined to meet with Defendant.

12.
On 3 December 2015, Defendant emailed Reigel and another MVA attomey,
Tom Myrick, again requesting a meeting to discuss Greene's lawsuit.
13.
Def~ndant indicated his intent to file a lawsuit against MV A and against Reigel
personally for intentional infliction of emotional distress and malicious prosecution unless
Reigel agreed to meet with Defendant.
14.
Defendant further indicated that the lawsuit he filed against MYA and Reigel
"would be accompanied by a social media campaign explaining everything going on with the
lawsuit including explanations of my sarcastic emails to Josh-interesting stuff about
[attomey name omitted], [attomey name omitted], and the Czar."
15.

The attomeys whose names are omitted are former MVA members.

16.

"The Czar" is a reference to a current MYA equity member.

17.
None of these individuals had any connection to the lawsuit Greene filed
against Defendant.
18.

Later on 3 December 2015, Defendant emailed Reigel again.

19.
Defendant stated he would expose the fact that an MYA attomey "forgave his
wife for sleeping with a lawyer at his firm as long as the lawyer left the firm" and ensure that
the MVA attomey's children leamed "how forgiving their father is."
20.

Defendant stated that the action he was threatening was "just for starters."

21.
The MYA attomey whom Defendant threatened with personal embarrassment,
as described in paragraph 19 above, had no connection to the lawsuit Greene filed against
Defendant.

22.
At 10:27 a.m. on 4 December 2015, Defendant emailed Reigel and continued
to threaten to expose alleged wrongdoing of various MYA actors.
23.
Defendant stated that his social media campaign against MVA would be
operated tlu'ough the URL "mmm.mvalawless" and that he would mention the firm name at
least four times in the disclaimer on his site to ensure his website would appear on the first
page of intemet searches for Moore & VanAllen.
24.
At 10:38 a.m. on 4 December 2015, Defendant indicated in an email to Reigel
that he would copy the string of emails he had sent to Reigel and send it to every lawyer at
MYA if Reigel did not contact mm by 5 p.m.
25.
At 11:13 a.m. on 4 December 2015, Defendant sent Reigel a message stating,
"Actually, that's way too much work. I'll just send it to 5 associates and they will do the rest."
26.
At 5:04 p.m. on 4 December 2015, Defendant forwarded all of ms previous
emails to five attorneys and members of the staff at MVA with the comment "Please read the
email string below and realize how great a lawyer one of your partners is."
27.
At 5:14 p.m. on 4 December 2015, Defendant sent Reigel an email stating,
"5:01 email sent to first 5 in alphabetical order. The first amendment is a wonderful thing.
And as you scurry to figure out what to do, remember that (1) truth is an absolute defense, and
(2) I haven't asked you for a dime. Now what?"
28.
During the time Defendant was sending these emails, he also had several
telephone conversations with attomeys at MVA where he indicated he was seeking
reimbursement of the legal fees he incurred in defending Greene's lawsuit.
29.
Defendant intended ms threats and harassment to intimidate MVA into
reimbursing mm for the legal fees he incurred in defending Greene's lawsuit.

enumerated in Rule .0114(w) of the Discipline and Disability Rules of the State Bar, 27 N.C.
Admin. Code 1B ยง .0114(w).
2.
The Hearing Panel concludes the following factors from Rule .0114(w)(I)
walTant consideration of suspension of Defendant's license:
(a) negative impact of the defendant's actions on the administration of justice; and
(b) effect of defendant's conduct on third parties.

Consent Order of Discipline

Page 4 of8

(e) Interim rehabilitation; and
(f) Cooperative attitude toward the proceedings.

potential discipline but finds that any sanction less than suspension would fail to acknowledge
the seriousness of the offenses committed by Defendant.
6.

misconduct, the Hearing Panel concludes that a suspension of Defendant's license, stayed
upon compliance with conditions, is the only discipline that:
(a) will adequately protect the public;
(b) acknowledges the seriousness of the offenses Defendant committed; and
(c) sends a proper message to attomeys and the public regarding the conduct
expected of members of the Bar of this State.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Additional Findings
and Conclusions Regarding Discipline, and with the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel
