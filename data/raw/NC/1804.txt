Pursuant to section 13 (A) of article IX of the Rules and
Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar, the Grievance
Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the
information available to it, including your response to the
.letter of notice, the Grievance Committee found probable cause.
Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable cause to
believe that a member of the North Carolina State Bar is guilty
of misconduct j.ustifying dis.ciplinary action. "

The rules provide that after a finding of probable. cause,
the Grievance Committee may determine that the filing of a
complaiht and a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission are not required and the Grievance Committee may issue
various levels of discipline depending upon the misconduct, the
actual or potential injury caused, and any aggravating or
mitigating factors. The Grievance Committee may issue an
admonition., reprimand, or censure to the respondent attorney.
A reprimand is a written form o.f discipline more serious
than an admon.; 1:;. O~J. issued in cas.es in which an attor.nay has
violated one or more provisions of the Rules ofPro!essional
Conduct anc1 has caused harm or potential harm to a client, the
administration of justice, the profession, or a member of the
pl.Ib~ic,_ b-ut _the misc5~nduc~ does not. r~quire a_ cens':lre._
__ _.
T~e Grievance Committee was of the opinion that a censure is
not required in this case and issues this reprimand to you. As
chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State
Bar, it is now my duty to issue this reprimand and I am certain
that you will understand fully the spirit in which this duty is
performed.

In 1993 you ran for a seat in the u.S. House of
Representatives. During the campaign, you circulated

different versions of your personal resum~ to various
individuals. Each of the resumes contained false statements
about your background and academic qual~fications. Among the
misrepresentations included on some or each of the reSUmes were
statements that you worked on the Law Review of'theWake Forest
School of Law I that yO\! graduated in the top 20% of, your law
school class tpat you graduated sixth, in you~ cla'ss at the Hill
School ~n Pottstown, Pa. and that you p~ayed varsity soccer at
UNC. It appears that these misrepresentat'ions were made for tb,e
purpose of gaining support for your congressional campaign. When
initially confronted by members of the news media with the false
resumes, you st'ated that the resumes were the work of an
overzealous campaign worker. It now appears, however, that you
were ~olely responsible for the resumes and that your initial
statement to the news media was false. You did later, howeve;t',
publ~cly accept res~onsibility for you~ conduct.
I

Your copduct in circulating resumes which fals~ly
represented your scholastic qualifications and in later making ell,
false statement to the media to conceal your actions constituted
conduct involving di$honesty, in violatiori of Rule i. 2 (B) of ·the
Rules of Professional Conduct.
Honesty i$ the polestar which must guide the activities of
members of the bar both in their dealings with clients and in
their qaily lives. Without honesty no attorney can be truly
~uccessful.
While the Committee is deeply concerned about the
damage whicp you have done both to your own reputation and tPat ,_
of the profession, it nevertheless believes that your conduct in
this case was an aberration and that you will henceforward work
hard to re-establish yourself as an honorable member 9fthe bar.
