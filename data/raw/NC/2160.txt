Rule~

pursuant to ,section ;01 13(ay 6f the Discipline and Disability'"
of the North Carolina State'
. Bar, the Grievance Committee conc,iucted a preliminary hearing. After considering the informa~ion
available to it, including your response to the letter of notice, the Grievance Committee found probable
cause. Probable causeJs defined in th;e rules as "reasonable cause to believe that a member oftl\te North
Carolina State Bar i.s guilty of misconduct justifying disciplinary action." .
The rules provide that aftep~a fmding of probable cause, the Grievance Committee ntay determine
that the filing of a c,omplaint and ~l'hearirtg before the Disciplinary Hearing Commission are not:
required, and the Grievance Committee may issue various levels of discipline depending upon the
misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any aggravating or mitigating factors. Th~
Grievance Committee may issue an admonition, a reprimand, or a censure to the respondent attorney. ,
A reprimand is a written form of discipline more serious than an admonition issued in .c~ses i~
which an attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct apdi has :
caused harr~ior potential harm to a client, 'the administration of justice, the profession, or a meniber of
the public, but the misconduct does not require a censure.

I

The 'Grievance Committee was of the opinion that a censure is' not requked in this case ap.d
issues this reprimand to you. As ch~nnan of the Grievance Committee of the North Carol~a S~ate Bat,
it is noW my duty to issue this reprimand, and I am certain that you will understand fully the spi:Jtit in •
which this duty is performed:
'
:
'

Ptio~ to May 1999, yOU und~rtook to draft wills for Mr. & Mrs. GW, who were then resi4ents of
Rowan Coun,ty. In mid-May 1999: 'you met with Mr. & Mrs. GW to review the pour-over wills ~d ,
health care powers of attorney which you 4ad drafted for them. The wills and powers of attorney were,
executed in the presence of only one disinterested witness, whereas the law requires that two
;
disinterested witnesses-be present.

Accordingly, after youretunied to your office;i:Y({ftdfrecte'd'~'~aralegal, Jt, to ,sign the GWs'
wills and health care poWers of attorney as a witness, even though 11 was not present at the time of '
execution of the documents by Mr; and Mrs. OW. JL indicated that'she felt that she had no ch.Jice bpt to
sign the documents, as you were her employer.'

,

JL clearly C9uld not properly sign Mr. & Mrs. GW's wills as a Witness, as she had not seen them
execute the documents. The fact that you were familiar ~th .your clients' signatures and saw tlleIiisign '
the wills did not authorize JL to sign as ~ attesting witlJ.~~.;~i:'Y It is fund~ental that a witness to a will
must sign a will in the presence of the testator. As a certified specialist in thear¢a of estates, y<>u'm'(,1st
certainly hav.e known this.

I

Your action in this matter constituted conduct prejudicial to the administration ofjustice in
violation of Rule 8.4(d) of the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct. It also jeopardized the validity c
your clients' wills and therefore constituted a violation of~evised Rule 8.4(g).
You are hereby reprimanded by the North Carolina State Bar due to your professionai
misconduct. The Grievance Committee trusts that you will heed:thi~ reprimand, that it will be
remembered by you" that it will be beneficial to you, and tWii you:
never again allow yourself to
depart from adherence to the high ethical ,standards of the legat' profession.' '

will

State Bar regarding the taxing of the admlnistrative and'mvestigative costs to any attQmey issued a
