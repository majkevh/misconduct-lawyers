COUNlY OF ANSON

IN RE: FREDERICK O'NEIL JONES

I, Frederick O'Neil Jones, being duly sworn, state the following:
I presently reside at Hope Haven, Inc., 1921 Charlotte Drive, Charlotte, North
Carolina, 28203.
I formerly resided on East Wade Street, Wadesboro, North Carolina.
On June 23, 1999, I pled guilty to five (5) counts of misdemeanor practicing law
without a license, in violation of North Carolina General Statute §84-4. As part of my
negotiated plea, I am to surrender my license to practice law in North Carolina.
The factual basis for the plea was that I gave legal advice and accepted a total of
nine hundred dollars ($900.00)knowing that my license were suspended under a previous
Court Order. I have made full restitution for the $900.00.
I agree and am requesting that the North Carolina State Bar allow me to surrender
my license.
My surrender of my license is freely and voluntary and not the result of coercion or
duress and I understand and am fully aware of the implications of the surrender.
I realize that I could not successfully defend a revocation of my law license if this
matter went to hearing.
I further waive any hearing or notice of hearing on disbarment concerning this matter
understanding that I can be disbarred without further notice or hearing.
