BASED UPON THE FOREGOING Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and upon
the evidence and arguments presented at the hearing concerning appropriate discipline, the
hearing committee hereby finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following
additional

FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.

Alston's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
a.
Prior disciplinary offenses, to wit: an Admonition in 2003 for failing to
respond to the State Bar and a Reprimand in 2006 for failing to appropriately
terminate representation of a client and failing to respond to the State Bar;

2.

b.

Dishonest or selfish motive;

c.

A pattern of misconduct;

d.

Multiple offenses;

e.

Vulnerability of the victims;

f.

Substantial experience in the practice of law; and

g.

Indifference to making restitution.

There are no mitigating factors.

3.
Alston's misappropriation resulted in significant harm to his clients. Alston's
conduct generally deprived his clients of their funds andlor the ability to have those funds used
on their behalf. Alston's theft of A. Garcia's client funds resulted in foreclosure on her home
after the bank did not receive the required payment from A. Garcia via Alston to prevent
foreclosure. Alston's theft of Griggs's settlement funds has left her with outstanding medical
bills and ongoing collection efforts by medical providers who should have been paid by the
money Alston misappropriated.
Alston's neglect and failure to communicate with clients resulted in significant
4.
harm to his clients. Alston's failure to appear at clients' court dates resulted in a range of
consequences, including arrest warrants issued for a number of his clients and suspended or
revoked driver's licenses. Additionally, Alston's neglect of a large number of clients' legal

matters prevented his clients from resolving their legal matters in a timely fashion, as well as
forced his clients to hire new counsel and incur additional legal fees.
5.
Alston's conduct resulted in significant harm to his clients and to the public.
Alston's neglect of clients' legal matters extended beyond the scope of the Default Judgment.
Alston failed to provide the legal services for which he was retained by former clients Lawrence
Williams, Charles Phillips, and Ormand Gagnon after these clients paid Alston for various legal
services by failing to appear at their respective court dates. Alston's conduct not only harmed
these clients' ability to timely resolve their respective legal matters, but also demonstrated an
ongoing pattern of neglectful conduct.
6.
Alston's conduct resulted in significant harm to the profession. Alston's neglect,
failure to communicate with clients, and failure to return unearned fees caused his clients to feel
their trust had been betrayed. Several of Alston's former clients expressed a sense of distrust of
the legal profession in general due to Alston's conduct.
7.
Alston's conduct resulted in potential significant harm to the profession. The
legal profession is entrusted with the privilege of self-regulation. The State Bar can only
regulate the profession if its members respond to inquiries of the State Bar and otherwise
participate in this self-regulation. Alston's failure to participate in this self-regulation
jeopardizes the profession's ability to remain self-regulating.
8.
The hearing committee has considered lesser sanctions and finds that disbarment
is the only appropriate discipline in this case. The hearing committee finds no lesser sanction is
appropriate given the breadth of the offenses and the extent of the harm. The hearing committee
finds that disbarment is the only sanction that can adequately serve to protect the public from
future transgressions by this attorney given the clear demonstration of misappropriation of client
funds, the substantial and ongoing pattern of neglect resulting in significant client harm, and the
demonstrated refusal to be regulated by the State Bar.
