Defen:dant wrote an additiona1letter requesting tWo more certified .copies of the order and

At the hearing of this matter, the Defen~ant testified that the reason that he did

I

;"~-'

handle the Driggers matter more promptly was because
Origgers had paid a lower fee th~ other
,
.

clients and could not afford to pay as much in attorney's fees as other clients.

15.

At some point fOllowing the filiiig of the Complaint, Driggers informed the

,Defendant that she wanted to discharge the Defendant as her attorney and requested a refund of
'all fees. The Defendaitt testified that he was discharged in .August, 1995. Driggers testified that
.

the Defendant was not discharged until February 21, 1996., The committee finds it UIinecessary

.

to resolve the factual dispute, because it is uncontested that Dnggers terminated the
•

I,'

representation at some point on or prior to February 2}, 1996.
16.

The matter was calendared for trial during the week of February 19, 1996.

17.

On February 3, 1996, Driggers hand delivered to the Defendant's office a letter

asking him for information about the case and stating, "If you are still my attorney, please call

I

me.,"

to Ab~rman, which stated in part:

th~ fa"ci that he'had been delivered the original file ~~~~ilil' m~~er was on the calendar for:
'hearing the next week. The Defendant told Aberman that neither the Defendant, nor anyone
from the Defendant's office attended calendar call on February 13, 1996.
23.

During the February 16, 1996 conversation, Aberman asked the Defendant if the

court:was aware that he was no longer representing the Driggers, and the Defendant informed
Aberman that he had told the judge that Driggers had fired him, and had told the clerk that they
would need to "send things" to Driggers.

26.

On February 21, 1996, the Defendant appeared in court without Driggers and

. attempted to file a voluntary dismissal of the action, but the judge would not accept the voluntary
dismissal without Driggers' signature indicating Driggers' consent.

I

27.

Driggers had never authorized the filing of a voluntary dismissal.

28.

The Defendant never filed a motion to withdraw;as coUIiSel in the matter after he

had been tenninated. by the Defendant.
29.

In the RespollSe, the Defendant states:

I believe it Was clear that Driggers did not :want me to pursue her motion.
However, prior to the next court date Ms. Driggers sent me a letter asking if I was
going to represent her. In this letter she finally sent me her new work number.
Her home phone was still disconnected. i contacted her and asked her if she had
hire [sic] anQther attorney. She said she could not afford on,e. I asked her what
she wanted to do. She told me she didn't want to pursue the action and asked me
to take a voluntqry dismissal. I said let me make a call to the adverse 'party and
see if we can settle the action quickly. She said I can't pay you for that and I tol4
her there would be no charge. I contacted the adverse' party but the [sic] were not
willing to discuss the matter and were very angry to have received a call when his
father was very sick in the hospital. I offered my sympathies and asked them to
call me when they felt up to it. I received the call the next day and they said that
Ms. Driggers had said she was going to dismiss the action and they would not p~y
another dime in child support. I informed Ms. Driggers of their response and filed
a voluntary dismissal.

By failing to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing the

client, th~ Defendant violated Rule 6(b)(3). The committee expressly fmds that the Defendant's
obligation under the Rules of Professional Conduct to handle Driggers' matter reasonably
