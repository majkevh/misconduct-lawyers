Pursuant to Rule .0125(b)(5), if the counsel for the State Bar does not file
a response to the petition for reinstatement before the petitioner is first eligible for
reinstatement, then the secretary will issue an order of reinstatement.

Since the counsel has not filed a response, it is appropriate for the
undersigned to issue an order of reinstatement.

filing of his Petition for Reinstatement, Mr. Norwood is eligible to be reinstated as of
July 8, 2013.
