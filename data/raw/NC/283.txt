Based upon the consent of the parties, the hearing panel also finds by clear,
cogent, and convincing evidence the following

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
Defendant's conduct caused significant harm to his clients; specifically,
Defendant's conduct has in some instances significantly impaired his clients' abilities to
pursue their respective legal claims, as well as caused the loss of paid legal fees without
any progress being made by Defendant on behalf ofthe client. Defendant's conduct does
not, however, demonstrate a dishonest or selfish motive on his part.

2.
Defendant's habitual neglect of his clients' matters has the potential to
cause significant harm to the standing of the legal profession in the eyes of the public
because it shows his disregard for his duties as an attorney. Such erosion of public
confidence in attorneys tends to sully the reputation of, and fosters disrespect for, the
profession as a whole. Confidence in the legal profession is a building block for public
trust in the entire legal system.
3.
Defendant's failure to respond to inquiries from the State Bar
demonstrates a refusal to participate in the self-regulation process. Such conduct
interferes with the State Bar's ability to regulate its members and undermines the
profession's privilege to remain self-regulating.
4.
Defendant was previously suspended pursuant to the Order of Discipline
issued by the Disciplinary Hearing Commission in case number 07 DHC 21 dated April
17, 2008. The basis for discipline in the 2008 Order of Discipline consisted of extensive
client neglect and failure to respond to the State Bar, which is similar to the conduct at
issue in the present action. The 2008 Order of Discipline suspended Defendant for five
(5) years, with Defendant being allowed to apply for a stay of the remaining portion of
the suspension after eighteen (18) months.
5.
As noted in the 2008 Order of Discipline, Defendant was diagnosed with
depression in or about May 2007. Defendant's depression contributed in part to the client
neglect and the failure to respond to inquiries from the State Bar in both the present
action and the conduct at issue in the 2008 Order of Discipline. Defendant is currently
undergoing treatment for his depression, and has entered into a contract with the
Lawyer's Assistance Program.
6.
While part ofthe client neglect in the present action occurred during the
same time period as the neglect for which Defendant was suspended by the 2008 Order of
Discipline, Defendant continued to neglect client matters during the wind-down period
prior to his previous suspension going into effect.
7.
Furthermore, after the 2008 Order of Discipline went into effect,
Defendant continually failed to respond to multiple inquiries from the State Bar. As
described above, Defendant failed to respond to Letters of Notice and follow-up
communications from the State Bar during both the fee dispute and the grievance
processes. Additionally, Defendant failed to respond to the State Bar's Letter ofNotice
in grievance file no. 09G0230, which Defendant received on June 25, 2009. Defendant's
consistent refusal to participate in the self-regulation process demonstrates a pattern of
misconduct that warrants further discipline.
8.
Despite the 2008 Order of Discipline and Defendant's ongoing treatment
for depression, Defendant remains a danger to the public due to his continued neglect of
client matters and refusal to participate in the self-regulation process. Defendant's
inability to comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct as well as the conditions
imposed upon him by the Disciplinary Hearing Commission require this panel to impose

additional discipline upon Defendant as the only means to adequately acknowledge the
wrongfulness of his conduct and protect the public.

Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel also enters the following

CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the hearing panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. lB ยง .OI14(w)(3) ofthe Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and finds the following factors are applicable in this matter:
a. Defendant's prior disciplinary offenses;
b. Absence of a dishonest or selfish motive on Defendant's part;
c. Defendant's pattern of misconduct;
d. Defendant engaged in multiple offenses;
e. The effect of Defendant's mental condition on the conduct in question;
and
f.

Defendant's substantial experience in the practice oflaw.

2.
The hearing panel has also considered all ofthe factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. IB ยง .OI14(w)(I) ofthe Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar
and finds the following factors warrant suspension of Defendant's license:
a. Defendant's actions had a negative impact on his clients' and potentially
the public's perception of the legal profession;
b. Defendant's conduct impaired each client's ability to achieve the goals of
the representation; and
c. Defendant's multiple instances of failure to participate in the legal
profession's self-regulation process.
3.
Any sanction less than suspension would fail to acknowledge the
seriousness of the offenses committed by Defendant, would not adequately protect the
public, and would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the
conduct expected of members of the Bar.
4.
Due to the extensive client neglect described in the present action and due
to Defendant's continued refusal to participate in the self-regulating process of the North

Carolina State Bar, the hearing panel finds and concludes that the public will only be
adequately protected by imposing an additional active suspension of Defendant's law
license for a set period of time.
5.
Defendant should be allowed the opportunity to apply for a stay of a
portion of the suspension imposed by this Order upon compliance with certain conditions
designed to ensure protection of the public as well as Defendant's continued compliance
with the Rules of Professional Conduct.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Findings
