referred to herein, an attorney at law licensed to practice in North C~olina, subject to the
rules, regulations and Rules of Professional Conduct of the North Carolina State Bar and
the laws·ofthe State of North Carolina.

I

3.

During all or a portion of the relevant periods referred to herein, defendant was actively
engaged in the private practice oflaw in the town of Windsor, Bertie County, North
Carolina.

4.

During all of the relev~t periods referred to herein, defendant had a law partnership
arrangem~nt

5.

with attorney Tonza Ruffin (hereafter "Ruffin").

Defendant .and Ruffin were both signatories on ~ attorney trust account maintained at
Southe1:'llB~ in Windsor, North Carolina, account # 5331706013

(hereafter "account

#6013").
6.

At some point before late July 2002, Ruffin obtained a new home mortgage loan
commitment from St. Luke Credit Union (hereafter "St. Luke") in the amount of
$150,000 to refmance her existing mortgage loan from CitiFinancial Mortgage (hereafter

As settl¢nwnt ag~nt at tlle. closjng, def~p.dant pr~pa,req a HUD-l Settlement Statement
showing the receipts and disbursements of the proceeds of Ruffin's new mortgage loan
and p~ovided St. Luke with a copy of the HUD-l Settl~m.~pt Statement. By law, the
HUD-1 Settlement Statement is required to accurately reflect all receipts and
Q.iSbws~ments

12.

in aresig~p.tial mQrtgage loan transaction.

At the, time of the closing, defendant had not obtained from CitiFinancial a statement of
the sp~cific amount of funds required to payoff the existing mortgage. Defendant elected
to clo$e the new mortg~~e and indicated on the HUD-l Settlement Statement an amount

I

that she estimated was required to p~y off CitiFinancial. The amount defendant estimated
as due: CitiFin,ancial to payoff the ,existing mortgage was $120,397.41.

13.

On or :about Aqgust2, 2002, defendant issl,1ed a trust accpunt check in the amount of
$120,397.41 to CitiFinancial. On, or about August 6,2002, CitiFinancial informed
def~Q.daht that t}1e correct payoff amount on the loan at that time was $123,554.09. On or

the amount $1,843.84 to supplement the August 2,2002 check. Shortly thereafter,
CitiFinancial informed defendant that CitiFinancial had not received the first check.
14.

On August 21, 2002, defendant issued another trust account check to CitiFinancial in the
amQW1t of $120,297.41 to pay off Ruffin's existing mortgage. CitiFinancial returned that
check and the check,for $1,843.84 to defep.dant, indicating that the combined amounts of
those checks were insufficient to s~tisfy the payoff amount on Ruffin's account.

15.

After a series of commu,picatiolls between defendant and/or Ruffin and CitiFinancial

I

cOI),gerbing the correct payoff ampunt, defendant issued another trust account check
payablb to CitiFinancial hi the amount of $122,241.25 on or about October 23, 2002.

benefit of st. Luke or Ruffin to satisfy Ruffm's obligations to CitiFinancial under the

Pursuant to the, closing instructions i~sued to defendant 'by St. Luke, defendant was
obligated to apply the $122,241.25 to satisfy all outstanding deed~ of trust on Ruffin's
prOperty so as to ensure that St. Luke's deed of trust occupied a ;first lien,po~ition on
Ruffin's property.

23.

Defendant deposited the $122,241.25 check drawn on trust account #6013 into a bahl(
account she maintained at First Citizens Bank, account #003102306994 (hereafter

Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Bearing Committee
makes by clear, cogent,. and convincing evidence, the following additional

FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.

Defendant's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
a. dishonest or selfish motive;

I

b.a pattern of misconduct;
c.multipleoffenses;
d.refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct;
e. vul~~rability of victims Harris and Swindles;
f. substantial e~pedence in the practice of law; and
g. indifference to making restitution.
2.

Defendant's misconduct is mitigated by the following factors:
a. absence of a prior disciplinary record; and
b. good reputation.

3.

~e aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors.

4.

Defendant's misconduct significantly harmed the legal profe~sion. Defendant's neglect
and failure to communicate with the Swindles caused the Swi11dles to feel their trUst had

I

been betrayed. The Swindles expressed a sense of ·4istrust of the legal profession in
general due to defendant's misconduct. Additipl1ally, defendant's dishonesty with her
fellow attorney, Mr. Ellis, also constitutes harm to the profession. Attorneys have a duty
to deal hO:Q,estly with each other. When attorneys do not do so they engender ·distrust
among fellow lawyers, th~reby harming the profession as a whole.

S.

Defendant's misconduct resulted in significant ham'l to herclieilts and to others.

"".

Defendant"s theft, of Mrs. Harris' funds has left her with ~ outstanding claimO~over
$29,000.00 due to Medi<;:aid. Defel1da,nt's theft of funds from the Es4tte of Clotee Gillam
del1ied the proper beneficiaries of the stolen funds. Defendant's failUl.'e to reschedule the
depositions of the Swindles, both prior to the scheduled date of deposition upon notice of .
Page 20 <;>f22

Mr. S,windle's work conflict and after the scheduled d~te of the deposition, ultimately
resulted in dismissal of the Swindles'case and precluded the Swindles from pursuing their
claim.. Defendant' s th~ft of the funds from Ruffin' ~ refinance loan caused a significant
ri~k of fin~cjal harm to both Ruffin and St. Luke.

6.

Def¢,ndant's false st~tements to the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar
,

inteifer~d with the Sw,te Bar's ability to regulate attorneys and undennined the privilege
of IflwYers in this State to r~~ajn self-regulating.
,

7.

Defep4flDt's
false sta,tement to the Court in the Swindles' case and her failure to appear
,

I

for the. Swindles without having followed proper procedures fot notifying the Court and

opPo~ing counsel. of conflicting court obligations caused prejudice to the administration
ofjusttpe.
8.

This Hearing Committee ha~ considered all altern~tives and fmds that no discipline other
than disb~ent wiUadeql:lfltely protect the public, the juqicial system and the profession
given the clear demonstration of multiple misappropriations of multiple clients' funds,
the pattern of dishonesty estab1i~hed by the evidence, and defendant's failure to
acknowledge the wrongfulness of her misconduct.

FUrthennore, entry of an order

impOSing djscipline less than disb~ent would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the

offetl~es committed by defendant and would send the wrong me~sage to attorneys
regarding the conduct expect~d of members of the Bar in this State.
Based l.lpon the foregoing findings of fact, conclusiol)s of law and additional findings of
fact regarding discipline, the Hearing Committee hereby enters the followmg
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

1.
