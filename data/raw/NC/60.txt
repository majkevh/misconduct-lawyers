Stedman H,. Hines, you stand before this Coun,c:i:1 today to'reGeive
a reprim?,nd which your peers, your :fellow members '/;IfTh,e North Carol;i..na,
State BaJ;, tllrough toeir duly elected represenj:ativ:es, have seEj!n fit t,o
orC[er.
This rep.rimand was no·t ordered by the Cound), of your State BaJ{,'

"

nor is it being de;Livered by me in its ngme and pursuant to ,its dii:'$ction,
as the result of casual or light hearted att,ention to your conc;lu~tw:h'iGh:
,

,

,

l;"esulted in such ,decis'ion; nor was it ordered or is 'it ibej:ng del:i,:vet~d
through malice or ill-will ,o,n the part of your fellows, or in,

an

effort

simply to cause you embarrassment.
The decision of the Trial C'ommi ttee an,d the action recoIirriiended
to and sub!?equently adopted by the Council of 'The North Cal:o:j::i:.na Sta,te!
Bar, was the result of very caref-q,l and painstaking inquiry ;i;ntoan d
consideration of all the facts, the ful~ and fair OPPOl;"tUr1;i.ty' affqrded
to you to be prese:nt, to be heard, and to. present you'j:'defens<?,

That

you, yourself, consider the findings made cand recomnienda:t:l~ns of the'
Trial Committee to the full COun,cil p.nd the adoptioi;l. of., such r~cco~en­
dation!? by the Council, to be fair I!!.nd Just is evidenced by the fact,
,

,

f

"

~

,

that you have filed no exception;:; and have noted rio appeal ;!::toni 'those
deterininations.
Your conduct while rep~esenting William S. Sny~eras' an: a'~~orn,$Y
at law is what initially came to the attention of the Grievance,Comm:i.tte~
of The North Carolina State Bar, and is what 'gives rise to Your ,presence'
here today before this Council.
You did agree to represnet Williiun S. $nyc;lel:, :Who was se~~in~redress
;i.n connection with a purchase of land in Swain Count:y and obtaf.,ning s~~h
redre$s as he might have against the grant'or.
In behalf of your client, you agree.d orany. and ?gain. in writing to.

represent him; accepted his money and assuJ;"ed him" ybu we~e gOingt;:o'
~rosecute

his claim.

Both Mr. Snyder and his legal advisor in the IIi;i.litary service.
placed their trust in you and expeCted you po ca:rl:"Y out yourp'rbreE:l:s~onal
responsibility as agreed upon,
T4is you failed to do.
You];' c;:onduct, in addition to its unf~atterin~ reflec,tion ;tiP9h
you and the enti'r!= Bar of this State, caused much unnecessary

4i E:l.tress:

and los;s of time ahd expense on the part of ·:Mr. 'Sny.der.
It caused your brethren at the Bar who are 'members of the .Gpiev:ance·
Committee, the Trial Gommittee, anq the COllncil of, The North Carolina.
State Bar, toe~pend much of their .time and concei"n.in carry~n~'9ut 'thei1:"
responsibility in dealing with a situation wh;i.ch .should neVel; have ari,s~n.
The fact that after the institution of this proceeding yoU:
obtained a release from 1:;1r. SJ;lyder does not ~xcuse you from' yortir: e'ar~ier
conduct.
You offer~d. your time and advice, acceI'ted money for tl1is'. o.Irer;
but gave nothing.
Your: conduct as set forth herein was· unprofessional; and di$honorab:le.
It violated not only the letter but;: also the spirit of the, cO'de ,of

prof~E:lsional ethics of The North Carolina S.tate B;;r.

I t was' ho.t ~uch
.

It was underhand~d:
"

conduct· as is 'expected of an officer of the Court.
r

It brings d;i.scredi t upon you and tends to place the Court;: 'aJ:'J.,d
your fellow members of the Bar in disreput~ and to be held up. to rid:i;cule
by the public.
For this conduct your brethren at the Bar reprimand you in th~
strongest terms.
We all 'have recently read and he.ard st;:orieswhere th~l:'eis. E:ltud:i,ed'
indiffe;t'ence by others to standards of ethic?lconduct; and th!= . genet.al
deliberate efforts of some to undermine and. destroy aJ;l. of .bur instit'l,ltiohs which were established for the administration .6f justice' ~eems.

in progress.
To the extent we, as lawyers·, 'so deport our:s~lves as to c'astf dis'credit

upon Qur profession., 'WeaJ:"e, however unwittingly., giving aid and cOIlJ.foJ:"t
to those ends.
It, therefo+,e, becomes so much mOJ;"e important that in 9 ur 'profess:L.on.at'
conduct a"nd in our relations to 01;1r clients, to other lawyers, and to' the

C01,lJ;'t, 'we, a,dhere t9 the highest stan,dards o:f the pro'fess;[on, de:c:il'
fairly and above boar<;i"

and above all, be hones t.

'Th,is i'8 ,th,e course

of conduct which will restQre in the minds 6f the Pllb1:l..c' and afIlong,

to,your homewith,thecyn:j.cal

these are so many empty words frQlJl some lawyers, that

m~an nothing.

r hope you will not have that fe~lfilg.
and the Council could have taken
your :r.aw license for

The' Tr:j.alCotnInitte'e
a Period 'o'f months,

i f they had felt that that
discipHne was .;ldv;i,sable b1,lt

reason they did not do s6 wag
the feeling that this

heeded by you; that it would be rel1lembered by you; and thatitwotild, ~e '

ben~ficial

to you and cause you never again to a'llow yourse'lf to depart,

from strict adherence to the highest ethical standa:r:ds of oU;Lgrea,t,

Accordingly, we all sincerely trust that this re:(Jrimand, instead
'of bein'g a yoke around your ne'c)<, will actually serve as aprof:i, table'
and, ever present reminder to weigh carefully ili the future your;LespbJ:?sibility to the, pl,lblic, to your clients, to your fellow attoxneys', and to
the Court,s, to the end, that you r;e-establish yours,elf ,as a reputa1;>le;"
respected member of our profession whose word and conc).uct may be :r;eiied
upon without question.
