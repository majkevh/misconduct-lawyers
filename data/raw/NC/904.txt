CHRISTIAN SCOTT MATHIS

THIS MATTER came before the undersigned Judge of Superior Court of Brunswick
County. Christian Scott Mathis was represented by Bruce A. Mason. Brian P.O. Oten
appeared on behalf of the North Carolina State Bar.
Based upon the Affidavit of Surrender of Law License submitted to the Court by

FINDINGS OF FACT

Christian Scott Mathis ("Mathis") was licensed to practice law in North Carolina
on 8 September 2000.

2.

Mathis operated a law office in Calabash, Brunswick County, North Carolina.

3.

In December 2015, Mathis knowingly forged two individuals' names on a
quitclaim deed in an attempt to fraudulently convey property from those
individuals to a third party. Mathis then knowingly facilitated the creation of a
false notary stamp for a licensed notary in South Carolina without that notary' s
knowledge or consent, and Mathis used the false notary stamp to notarize the
forged signatures on the quitclaim deed. Mathis also forged the notary' s signature
on the deed, and .Mathis filed the forged and falsely notarized quitclaim deed with
the Brunswick County Register of Deeds.

4.

On this date, Mathis entered pleas of guilty to one count of Common Law Forgery,
one count of Common Law Uttering, and one count of Attempted Notary Fraud.

practice law in North Carolina.

7.

Mathis's resignation is freely and voluntarily rendered. It is not the result of
coercion or duress. Mathis is fully aware of the implication of submitting his
resignation.

defend against them .
