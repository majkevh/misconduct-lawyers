REPRIMAND

))

On October'26, 1999, the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar met and
considered the grievances filed against you by the North Carolina State Bar.
Pursuant to section .Ol13(a) of the Discipline and Disability Rules of the North Carolina
State Bar, the Grievance Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the
information available to it, including your responses to the letters of notice, the Grievance
Committee found probable cause. Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable caUse to
believe that a member pf the North Carolina State Bar is guilty of misconduct justifying
disciplinary aqtion."
The rules provide that after a finding of probable cause, the Grievance Committee may
determine that the filing of a co~plaint 'and a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing .
Commission are not reqUired, and the Grievance Committee may issue various levels of
discipline depending upon the misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any
aggravating or mitigatIng factors. The Grievance Committee may issue an admonition, a
reprimand, or a,censure to the respondent attorney.

I

A reprimand is a written form of discipline more serious than an admonition issued in
cases in which an attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional
Conduct and has caused harm or potential harm to Ii client, the administration of justice, the '
profession, or a member of the public, but the misconduct does not reqUire a censure.
The Gri~vance Committee was of the opinion that a censure is not required in this case
and issues this reprimand to you. As chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North
Carolina State Bar, it is now my duty to issue this reprimand, and I am certain that you will
understand fully the spirit in which this duty is performed.
I
I
For approximately two years you have been practicing law with James R. Miklosko. Mr.
Miklosko represented himself as an attorney at law who was practicing with you. Mr. Miklosko
performed title examinations, superVised the preparation of closing documents, and would be
present at the time of closing in a very active residential real estate practice. On occasion, Mr.
Miklosko would handle the closings when you Were not present in the office. There were two
sets of business cards that you or someone in your office had made showing Mr. Miklosko as an

attorney at law. Mr. Miklosko would distribute the cards to individuals indicating that he w~s art
attorney in the office; when in fact he was not a lawyer. At the very least, you provided the
instrumentality by which Mr. Miklosko was able to hold himself out as a lawyer without.a
license, and did not adequately supervise your employees. Your actions violated Rule 3.1 and
Rule 3J of the Superseded Rules of Professional Conduct, and Rule 5.3 and Rule,5.5 of the
Revised Rules of Professional Conduct.'
.
You are h.ereby reprimanded by the North Carolina State Bar due to your professional
misconduct. The Grievance Committee trusts that you will heed this reprimand, that it will be
remembered by you, that it will be beneficial to you, and that you wili never again allow yourself
to depart from adherence to the high ethical standards of the l~gal profes~iOIi.

I

In accordance with the policy adopted October 15, 1981 by the Council of the North
Carolina State Bat regarding the taxing of the administrative and investigative costs to any
attorney issued a reprimand by the Grievance Committee, the costs of this action in the amount
of $5'0.00 are hereby taxed to you.
