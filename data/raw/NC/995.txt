THE NORTH CAROLINA STATE BAR,
Plaintitf
v.

FINDINGS OF FACT,
CONCLUSIONS OF LA W. AND
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

WILLIAM D. ORANDER, III, Attorney,
Defendant

This matter was heard on 25 February 2010 belore a hearing panel of Ihe
Disciplinary Hearing Commission composed of the Chair, F. Lane Williamson, and
members Ronald R. Davis and David L Williams. Jennifer A. Porter represented
Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar. Defendant did not appear and was not
represented.
Based upon the pleadings, the stipulated facts, and the evidence introduced at the
hearing, the hearing panel hereby finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the
following
FINDINGS OF FACT
I.
Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar ("State Bar"), is a body duly
organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this
proceeding under the authority granted it in Cllapter 84 of the General Statutes of Nortll
Carolina, and the Rules and Regulations of the North Carol ina State Bar (Chapter 1 of
Title 27 ofthe North Carolina Administrative Code).
2.
Defendant, William D. Orander, III ("Orander"), was admitted to tile
North Carolina State Bar in ]995, and is, and was at all times referred to herein, an
attorney at law licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the laws of the State of
North Carolina, the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and the Rules
of Professional Conduct.
3.

Orander was properly served with process, a hearing in this matter was set,

and the matter came before the hearing panel with due notice to all parties.

4.
During all or part of the relevant periods referred to herein, Orander was
engaged in the practice of law in the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office
in Goldsboro. Wayne County, North Carolina.
5.

Orander was the closing attorney for numerous real estate transactions

from about January 1,2004 through December 31. 2006 in which individuals purchased
property financed by loans secured by that property, including those transactions listed on
attached Exhibit AI.
6.
For the real estate closings on the list attached as Exhibit A. Orander
prepared liUD-1 Settlement Statements that falsely reflected that the loans were
refinance loans as opposed to purchase loans and provided those false HUD-l Settlement
Statements to the lending institutions.
7.
Orander knew that only the HUD-I Settlement Statement that falsely
showed the purchase transaction as a refinance transaction was being provided to the
banks. Orander knew that another HUD-I Settlement Statement that he also prepared for
these closings that showed the purchase nature of the transaction was not going to the
banks.
8.
Orander prepared and submitted the false refinance HUD-I Settlement
Statements in conjunction with others who sought to disguise the purchase transactions as
refinance transactions.

9.
The institutions making the loans for the closings listed in Exhibit A
underwrote the loans as if they were refinance loans rather than purchase loans. In
several instances, the amount loaned exceeded the purchase price of the house, and the
borrowers received money from the closings.
10.
Orander knew that the lenders would loan more money to the borrowers
for a refinance loan than for a purchase loan at the time ofrhe conduct described herein.
II.
Orander prepared the false refinance HUD-I Settlement Statements to
enable the borrowers to borrow more money than otherwise would have been approved
for a purchase loan.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the hearing panel enters the following
CONCLUSIONS OF LA W
I.
All the parties arc properly before the Disciplinary Hearing Commission
and the Disciplinary Hearing Commission has jurisdiction over the Defendant, William
D. Orander, Ill, and the subject matter.

1 The Exhibit A for Hearing reflects changes from the Exhibit A that was attached to Plaintiff's Complaint
that conform the list to the evidence presented at the hearing. The transactions in the rows that are not
shaded gray are the transactions in which the conduct described herein is found to have occurred.

2

2.
Defendant's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes
grounds for disciplinc pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stal. ยง 84-28(b)(2), for engaging in conduct
in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct in et'tect at the time of his actions as
follows:
a.

By preparing and providing the lenders with false refinance HUD-I
Settlement Statements, Orander engaged in conduct involving dishonesty,
fraud, deceit. and misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4Cc): and

b.

By preparing and providing the lenders with false ret,nance HUD-I
Settlement Statements and hy closing transactions in which he knew the
lender had received false refinance HUD-I Settlement Statements,
Orander assisted others in committing fraud upon the Icnder in violation of
Rule 8.4(a), Rule 8.4(e), and Rule 1.2(d).

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and upon the
evidence and arguments presented at the hearing concerning appropriate discipline, the
hearing panel hereby finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following
additional
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
Banks are not normally thought of as vulnerable entities. Nevertheless,
the banks relied upon Orander as closing attorney to carry out the closings in an ethical,
lawful, and proper manner. These institutions are placed at risk by the conduct of
attorneys that circumvent or knowingly facilitate others in the circumvention of
safeguards employed to avoid fraud.
2.
Southern Bank and New Century Bank each had lending policies specific
to purchase transactions and lending policies specific to other financing referred to as
retinance transactions.
3.
For purchases, the lenders would loan 80%-85% of the purchase price or
the appraised value, whichever is lower. The buyer would be expected to pay the
remainder of the purchase price. It is significant to the banks that the buyers contribute
that remaining 15%-20% of the purchase price as part of the banks' risk analysis, to
ensure the borrowers have a stake in the property and are therefore less likely to walk
away from the property and default on the loan.
4.
The lenders relied on the HUD-l Settlement Statements to accurately
reflect the nature of the transaction and the receipt and disbursement of funds in these
closings. Orander's preparation and submission of HUD-l Settlement Statements that
failed to accurately show the transaction as a purchase and did not accurately show the
receipt and disbursement of funds for that purchase evaded the safeguards relied upon by
the lender in purchase transactions.

3

5.
Southern Bank and New Century Bank would typically loan 80%-85% of
the appraised value of property for a retinance loan. No money would typically be
required from the borrower at closing. The borrowers would typically receive money
from a refinance loan. The underwriting on refinance loans is based on the borrower
already having a stake in the propcrty from the borrower's equity. Orander's preparation
and submission of HUD- I Settlement Statements that made purchase transactions falsely
appear to be refinance transactions furthered and helped effectuate a scheme whereby the
banks loaned significantly more than they otherwise would have for purchase
transactions and whereby the borrowers received money tram the loans in addition to
acquiring property rather than contributing money toward the purchases.
6.
Orander not only participated in the scheme to disgui se purchase
transactions as refinances as closing attorney, but also as borrower through his companies
Goldtower Properties, LLC and Abbey Road Investments, Inc. As borrower, hc
participated in having documents falsely reflecting the transaction as a refinance provided
to the bank, including false H UD-I Settlement Statements and promissory notes falsely
indicating the purpose of the loan to be a refinance. In the five transactions on Exhibit A
in which one of his companies participated as borrower, the borrower companies received
a total of$96,677.64 in cash back from the loans.
7.
Southern Bank has had to charge down most of its loans listed on
A.
which
means it has had to reduce the value of those loans. As a result it
Exhibit
expects to collect $283,655.00 less from these loans than it loaned. Southern Bank has
had to charge off certain amounts on loans that went into default and where the properties
were sold in foreclosure, realizing losses from those loans in the amount of $37.261.00.
Southern Bank loaned at least $714,588.00 more than it would have for the loans on
Exhibit A had it known the true nature of those transactions.
8.
Orander engaged in conduct involving misrepresentation and deceit over a
substantial pcriod oftime.
9.
Clients are entitled to attorneys they can trust. Orander, by engaging in
conduct involving misrepresentation and deceit over a substantial period of time, has
shown himself to be untrustworthy. When an attorney violates that trust, it harms the
public and the profession.
10.
Orander suggested in his defense that the ba.'1k desired the HUD-I
Settlement Statements falsely show the purchase transactions as refinances. The
evidence, however, did not support the notion that anyone at the banks other than a lone
loan officer knew of or wanted purchase transactions disguised as refinances.
Furthermorc, it is no defense to attorney misconduct that a client requested such
misconduct. Should a client request that an attorney engage in conduct involving
dishonesty, fraUd, deceit, or misrepresentation, it is the duty of the attorney to refuse to
engage in, or assist with, such conduct.

4

II.
Orander's obligation as closing attorney was to produce an accurate HUDI Settlement Statement for each transaction. Accurate HUD-I Settlement Statements are
necessary for the system of finance in real estate to function.
12.

Orander has no prior disciplinary record concerning his license to practice

law.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Findings of Fact
Regarding Discipline, and upon the evidence and arguments presented at the hearing
concerning appropriate discipline, the hearing panel hereby enters the following
additional
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The hearing panel has carcti.I!ly considered the factors listed in
Rule .OI14(w) of the North Carolina State Bar Discipline and Disability Rules. The
hearing panel finds evidence ofthe following factors:
a. From Rule .OI14(w)(I):
I.

Intent of the defendant to cause the resuiting harm or potential
harm. Orander prepared and submitted false HUD-I Settlement
Statements to the banks in order to assist in making the
transactions look like refinances and obtain larger loans from the
banks.

II.

Intent of the defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential
harm is foreseeable. Our financial system is dependent upon
accuracy and truthfulness in disclosure, and harm or potential harm
is foreseeable anytime a financial institution is asked to make loan
decisions based upon false information.

iii. Circumstances reflecting the defendant's lack of honesty,
trustworthiness, or integrity. This factor is evident on its face
given that Orander clearly prepared and submitted false I-IUD-I
Settlement Statements.
IV.

Elevation of the defendant's own interest above that of the client.
Although it did not appear that Orander got any more than a
relatively modest attorney's fee for the closings generally, he did
profit through his companies participating in this scheme as
borrowers and getting loans in amounts that otherwise would not
have been available. In this way he elevated h is own interests over
that of his clients, the banks.

v. Impairment of the e1ient's ability to achieve the goals of the
representation. Orander's participation in disguising purchases as
5

refinances impaired the banks' ability to accurately apply its
lending policies.
VI.

Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication, as
articulated in the conclusion of law above, by creating and
submitting false HUD-I Settlement Statements disguising purchase
transactions as refinances and closing loans in which he knew the
banks were receiving this false information.

b. From Rule .01 14(w)(2):
I.

Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit. or fabrication, as
stated in the rule violations lound and further articulated in these
findings and conclusions regarding discipline.

c. From Rule .01 14(w)(3):
i. No prior disciplinary offenses.
ii. Dishonest or sellish motive. There is evidence of dishonest motivc
in Orander's intent to assist in making purchase transactions
falsely appear to be refinances. There is evidence of a selfish
motive in the personal benefit to Orander through those loans to
entities in which he had an ownership interest.
III.

Indifference to making restitution. There were no good faith
efforts to rectifY the consequences of his misconduct.

iv. A pattern of misconduct. Orander engaged in submitting false
information to the banks in 49 transactions identified in Exhibit A.
v. Multiple offenses. Orander's conduct in 49 transactions violated
several different provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct
as set out above.
vi. Refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct. Orander did
not acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct in his
responses to the Grievance Committee, and the matters he
presented in defense in response to the Grievance Committee were
largely irrelevant. By his absence at the hearing before the hearing
panel in this matter, he has also refused to acknowledge the
wrongful nature of his conduct.
vii. Degree of experience in the practice of law. At the time of the
conduct, Orander had been practicing law for aboUl ten (10) years.
This is sufficient time to be considered an experienced practitioner.
Certainly as a real estate lawyer Orander should have recogn ized
the wrongful nature ofthis conduct.
6

2.
Orander's conduct resulted in significant harm to Southern Bank and
created potential significant harm for New Century Bank. Orander's conduct evaded
safeguards relied upon by both Southern Bank and New Century Bank. Southern Bank
loaned significantly more than it otherwise would have for the loans in Exhibit A, has
suffered actual losses upon foreclosure of certain loans and expects to rcceive
significantly less than it loaned for other outstanding loans on Exhibit A.
3.
Orander's conduct, involving misrepresentation and deceit over a
substantial period of time, resulted in significant harm to his clients and the profession
and posed potential significant harm to the public that may have sought to retain him or
those who may have dealt with him in other capacities. When an attorney violates the
trust clients and others should be able to have in attorneys, it harms the public and the
profession.
4.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and
disbarment, in considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
5.
The hearing panel has considcred all lesser forms of sanctions available to
it and finds that disbarment is the only appropriate discipline in this case, for the
following reasons:
a. Orander committed misdeeds involving moral turpitude and violations of
the public trust, including fraudulent conduct. material misrepresentations,
and deceit. Misconduct involving misrepresentations and deceit are
among the most serious that an attorney can commit, Such offenses
demonstrate that the offending attorney is not trustworthy. Clients are
entitled to have trustworthy attorneys;
b. The factors under Rule .01 14(w) that are established by the evidence in
this case are of a nature that support imposition of disbarment as the
appropriate discipline;
c. Entry of an order imposing lesser discipline than disbarment would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses committed by Orander, would
be inconsistent with discipline issued in prior cases involving similar
misconduct, and would send the wrong message to attorneys and the
public regarding the conduct expected of members of the North Carolina
State Bar; and
d. The protection of the public and the legal profession requires that Orander
not be permitted to resume the practice of law until he demonstrates the
following: that he has reformed; that he understands his obligations to his
clients, the public, and the legal profession; and that permitting him to
practice law will not be detrimental to the public or the integrity and
standing of the legal profession or the admioistration of justice.
7

Disbarment is the only discipline available that requires an attorney to
make such a showing before he or she may be reinstated.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Findings of
Fact Regarding Discipline, and Conclusions Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel
hereby enters the following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

I.
Defendant, William D. Orander, Ill, IS hereby DISBARRED from the
