CENSURE '

On January 15,2004, the Gne:vance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar met alid
considered the grievances filed ~g~inst you by The North Catolina State Bar.
Putsum1t to section .0113(a) of the Discipline and bisabilityltules of the North Carolina State
Bar, the Griev@ce Committee condl.lcted a preliminary hearing. After considering the information.
available to it, including your responSe to the letters of notice, the Grievance Committee found probable
cause. Probable caUSe is defined in the rules as "reasonable cause to believe that a memb.er of the North
Carolina State Bar is gUilty of misconduct justifying disciplinary action."
The rules provide that after ~ finding of probable cause, the Grievance Committee may
detennine that the filing of a complaint and ~ hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing Commission are
no.1 required alid the GrIevance Committee may issue various levels of discipiine depending upon the
misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any aggravating or nUtigating factors. The
Grievance Conlmittee maY issue an admonition, a reprimand, or a censure.

slgmficant hann or potent~al slgmficant harm to a chent, the admimstratIon ofJustIce, the professIOn or
a member of the public, but the misconduct does not require suspension of the attorneY's license.

The Grievance Committee believes that a hearing before the bisciplinary Hearing Commi$sion
is not required in this case and issues this censure to yoli. As chairman orthe Grievance Committee of
the North Carolina State Bat, it is now my dl.lty to issue this cellsure. I am certain that you will
understand fully the spirit in which this duty is perfonned.
On July 8 and 9~ 2003 you represented 17 clieilts who had traffic caSes in Onslow County
District Court. Pursqant to a policy imposed by the elected DA,.aIl of your clients we~e required to'
personally appear in court.. You b¢li~ved that this policy was grossly unf~ and was l~veled at you
because you had oppo's~a' the DA in his last election Caqlpaigq.,
.
'
You subpoenaed the arresting officers to court in each of the 17 cases and insisted on enforcing
the subpoenas even though tl1e ADA handling the cases offered favota1;;le pleas to your clients and
m~de it cleat that the offers would be ~ithdrawn if you required the atr~~ting officers to ~ppea:t,in court.

You refused to release the,officers, some of whom were attendhlg to other duties or on leave. The
ADA called the first three cases for trial and each client was convicted.
Even when the AbA gave you a chance to re-think yopr position, you insisted on pursuing your
original plan. thereafter all 17 clients were convicted and several went to jail.
The GrieVaFlCe Committee found that you let your personal feud with the DA take precedence
over pursuing your clients' best interests; in clear vioJ~tion of Rule 1.7.
In another matter, on A~gust 18, 2003 ypu appeared ill 'Onslow CoUnty District Court before

Judge Sarah Seaton. Upon inquery by the Court, you stated that you were unable to resolve a particular
case "beca\lse;the DA is an ass."
i

Tbis remark caused the Court to adjourn and delayel,i. resolution of several hundred other matters
then on the do~ket. Your conduct was not only unprofessional but was' prejudicial to the administration
of justice, and ithus violated Rule 8.4(<;1).
You ate hereby censured by the North Carolina State Bar fot your violation of the Rules of
Professional Conduct. The Grlevan«e COmD;1ittee trusts ¢at you willlJonder this censure, recognize the
error that you have made, and that you will never again allow YOUrself to depart from adherence to the
high ethical standards of the legal profession. This censure should serve as a strong reminder and
. inducement fot yo~ to weigh carefully in the future your re~'ponsibility to tbe public; your clients, your
fellow attorneys and the courts, to the end that you demean yourself as a respected member of the legal
'
profession whose conduct may be relied upon without question.
i

'In accordance with the policy adopted October 15, 1981 by th~ COP,ncil of the North Carolina
State Bar regaiding the taxing of the adininistrative and inves~igative costs to any attorney issued a
'" 'censllre by the iGri.evance Committee, the' costs of this action in the amount of $50.00 are hereby taxed
to you.
