BEFORE THE

OF THE
NORTH CAROLINA STATE BAR
9S DHC 4

FINDINGS OF FACT
AND
CONCLUSIO~S

OF LAW

THIS ~TTER, coming on to be heard on Friday, June 30, 1995,
by a Hear~ng Committee of the Disciplinary Hearing Commissio~o;
the North Ca.rolina State Bar, composed of Stephen T. Smith,ChciLir;
Paul L. Jones; and B. Stephen Huntley.
The Plaintiff, the' North
Carolina State Bar, w~s represented by R. David He~derson.
'rhe
Def~ndant, Barbara K. Moreno, WaS repre~ented by James B. Maxwell.
Based upon the pleadings herein and the evidence introduced at
trial, the Hearing Committee makes the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT
1.
The Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar, is a b.ody
duly organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the prope~'
party to bring this proceeding under the authority granted 'it in
Chapter 84 of the General Statutefi of North Carolina, and the Rules
and Regulatio~s of the North Carolina state Bar promulgated
thereunder.
2.
The De~endant, Barbara K. MQreno (hereinafter "Moreno")
was admitted to the North Carolina State Bar on May 2, 1985, ant;i
is, and was at all times referred to herein, an attorney at law
licensed to .practice in North 'Carolina, subject' to the r·ules,
regulations and Rules of Professional Conduct of the North Caroli~a
State Bar and the laws of North Carolina.

3.
During all of the periods referred to herein, Moreno was
actively engaged in the practice of law in the state of Nortb
Carolina and maintained a law office in the city of High Point,
.
.
Guilford County, North Carolina.
4~
On February 12, 1994J Tommie Jerald Gathing~was charged
wi th Drivd,.ng While Impaired and Driving While License Revoked.
Soon thereafter, Mr. Gathings received a letter from The Legal
Alternative, a law firm which Moreno owns, iJ:;i.viting Mr. Gathings
to contact The Legal Alternative in connection with represehting
him on those charges.

5.
After receiving the letter, Mr. Gathings called The Legal
Alternative: and was given an appointment with Karen Fisher.
Ms.
Fisher was an attorney employed by the fir.m who ordinarily handled
criminal and tr~ffic matters in Davidson County, the county in
which Mr. Gathings' case would be heard.
6•
Mr. Gathings agreed, to hire The Legal Al terna tive to
represent him in ~his matter. He asked Ms. Fisher to continue the
case as long as, possible to allQw him sufficient time to pay the
fee, costs and anticipated fine. After Ms. Fisher obtained sever~l
continuances on March 9, March 28 and April 18, the charges against
Mr. Gathings were set for trial on Monday, May 16, 1994, in the
ci.ty of Lexington, Davidson County, ·North C~rolina. Due to other
commi tments • in court for Ms. Fisher, she was unab.le to go to
Davidson County on May 16. Barbara K. Moreno therefore agree~. to
appear in coUrt on behalf of the fir.m's client.
7.
From the intake sheet that had been prepared in Moreno's
office, Ms. :Fisher and then Ms. Moreno knew that Mr. Gathings had
two factors which would be considered "grossly aggravating" factors
in a DWI charge.
These two factors included an offense of DWI
within a seyen-year period of time, as well as the charge of
Dr.iving While License Revoked.
These two grossly aggravating
factors would have indicated that the nor.mal sentence for such a
charge would have been 7 - 14 days in jail, which more likely than
not could be: spent on weekends, since Mr. Gathings was, in fact,
employed at ~he ti~e.

I

8.
It is the custom in Davidson County for two Assistant
District Attorneys to participate in criminal/traffic calendars.
Once the calendar is called, the group of cases with attorneys who
desire to negotiate with an ADA are taken to another room outside
the courtroom where an ADA begins the process of attempting to
negotiate pleas that will allow those cases to be disposed of. On
May 16, 1994; Chris Gentry was the ADA assigned t·o the courtroom
and Georgia N,ixon was the ADA assigned to the negotiation of pleas.
9.
A practice that occurs in Davidson County District CoUrt
is for attorneys to speak ninfor.mallyn wit~ judges about
"hypothetical; caseS" .in order to get some prediction as to what is
apt to happen should the attc::n:ney plead his/her client to a
@lpec;if;i.e c:llarge wj,. tb ~p@e;J.t:l.c 'background i:gJ~e;':lnCJ,~:l.on ~
::r;~ ~~~.~
~anner, ~~$es are Q~ten'co~t~nued to a later dat~ a~~~~ the ~~dg~
has indicated what his/her. judgment would likely be in-' the
"hypothetical situation " and these continuances are often then
sought from the ADA without the judge being directly involved.
10. The, Honorable Jessie M. Conley was the District Court
Judge presiding in Davidson County Traffic/Criminal Court on
Monday, May 16, 1994. Judge Conley did not typically engage in the
infor.mal "pre~ictions" described above.

11. After the calendar was called and Mso Nixon had gone to
the adjacent :r;oom to negotiate pleas with attorneys, Mor(3ho,on
behalf of Mr. Gathings, went to Ms. Nixon to <iiscuss apl~a
arrangement.
A plea agreement was reached between Ms. Nixon and
Ms. Moreno whereby Mr. Gathings agreed to plead Guilty toOrivi~g
While Impaired and to Driving with No Operators Licenst;!..The.
charge of Driving While License Revoked w01,1.1d be dismissed.
A'
notation to that e'ffect was made by Ms. N~xon for the benefi'tQf
the ADA in court (Mr. Gentry) .
. 12. Ms. Moreno returned to the courtroom and shortly
thereafter, Mr. Gentry called the case against Mr. Gathings' for
trial. Mr. Gentry inquired how Mr. Gathings would plead to Drivi~g
While Impaired and Driving with No Operators License, consiste~t
with the plea notation noted in the file.
Moreno, on behal'f ,of
GathingS!, 'answered that Gathings would plead Guilty' to theS!.:!
charges.

I

I

13 • After the entry of plea, there was a brief summary of tl1e
case by Mr. Gentry; based upon the traffic ticket itself, and Judge
Conley asked, about Mr. Gathings' criminal and traffic recQr4.A
computer printout is normally available and in the ~ile and on thls
occasion Ms. Moreno also handed up to the judge her office's DMV
check, which is a seven-year check. On his driving record there
was a ~otation that in 1990, Mr. Gathings had a 10-day revocation,
but there was no corresponding conviction shown fo:r; Driving While
Impaired, although that would normally acqompany the lO-day
revocation.
Judge Conley inquired abQut that, because such a.
conviction would have been a grossly aggravating fact'or, having,
occ1,1.rred within seven years of sentencing.
14. Scott Idol, a probation officer, was in the court~90m and,
was asked to check the Davidson County records to determine whet11.er
or not Mr. Gathings' 10-day revocation was in connect'ion wi,th a
convictio~ of DWI.
At some point during diS!cussiC)ns, Mr. Idol'
cc:mfirmed that Mr • Gathings was convicted of DWI in 1990 and Placed
on probation. Mr. Idol also reported to judge Conley that it was
his recC)llection or belief that Mr. Gathings may, 'in fact, be in
violation of the 19,90 probation order. That information was -qnable
to be obtained at that particular t,ime, but Judge Conley indicat,ed
a strong desire to learn specifically about the po.tential p;oobation
'violation, if, i~ tact, that applie4.
15. Mr. Gathings strongly denied to Ms. l(oreno that he
on prob.tion or that he had ever violated probation and asS!ured
that the probation officer was making a mistake. . This was
information that Ms. Moreno had from the file maintained by
o£fice, nor in the brief conversation she had earlier had with

was
her
ta,ot
~er

Mr.

Gathi~gs.

16. At that point, Ms. Moreno and Mr. Gent~ approached tlla
bench and Ms. Moreno inquired of Judge Conley what sentence she

would be liikely' to impose based upon the alleged probation
violation.
Judge Conley indicated to her that she would be
inclined to give Mr. Gathings a two-year active sentE!nce.
Ms.
Moreno infor.med Judge Conley that she needed a few minutes. to talk
with her client.
17. MJ:!. Gathings and Ms. Moreno went outside the courtroom
to confer. Judge Conley went on with other matters in the absence
6f the probation officer, who was seeking additional information
on Mr. Gathings.
In the conference outside the' 'courtroom, Mr.
Gathings ac~owledged that he had been convicted of DWI in 1990,
which was already known by Ms. Moreno, her office and the court.
He adamantly denied that he was on probation or that he had
violated any prior probation and insisted that Mr. idol had him
confused with someone else. Mr. Gathings strongly urged Ms. Moreno
to get the c~se continued for him.
18. Ms. Moreno was of the opinion, at that point, that Judge
Conley was going to sentence her client to two years in prison,
regardless o:f what information ultimately was received from the
probation of~icer a~d it was agreed that she would try and get a
continuance ~rom the ADA.
Thereafter, Moreno met with Ms. Nixon
and advised her that she needed one more continuance. She told Ms.
Nixon that Judge Conley had indicated she was going to give Mr.
Gathings a t~o-year active sentence and she also advised Ms. Nixon
that Mr. Gentry would be opposed to a continuance.
She did not
inform Ms. Nixon that her client had been arraigned, had entered
a plea of Gu~lty, and that evidence had been received and the case
was awaiting sentencing with more information from the probation'
officer.

I

19. Ms. Nixon agreed to a continuance under the circumstances
as they were related to her and,' in fact, noted on the file a new
da~e of June 7, 1994.
20. Thereafter,
Ms.
Moreno and her client left
the
courthouse, Mr. Gathings returning to work and Ms. Moreno returning
to her office, in High Point.
21. Later in the morning, Judge Conley inquired about the
status of Ms.' MorenO's case, as she had heard many other matters.
~he qlerk advised the judge that according to the shuck notation,
Ms. Nixon had continued the case till June 7, 1994. JUdge Conley
indicated th4t at that point, only she could have granted a
continuance and requested that both Me. Nixon and Ms. Moreno return
to court as soon as possible.
22. Ms. Moreno was reached at her office between 11:00 ..
11:30 a.m. and told that Judge Conley desired to see her back in
court in regard to the Gathings matter. She immediately got back
in her car ana drove to Lexington, arriving at the courthouse at
approximatelY,12:00 Noon.

Gathings was not on probation, nor in violation of probation. The
judge s!S!ntenced Mr. Gathings to 14 days in jail, which was to· be

ter.ms of his sentence thereafter.

BEFORE THE
DISCIPLINARY HEARING COMMISSION

NORTH CAROLINA STATE BAR

NORTH CAROLINA
WAKE COuNTy,
THE NORTH
Pl~'intiff ,

ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

VB.

BARBARA K. MORENO, Attorney
Defendant.
BASED U:PON THE FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW entered
herein and the evidence presented at the second phase of the
hearing, th~ Hearing Committee, composed of Stephen T. Smith,
Chair; Paul L. Jones; and B. Stephen Huntley, enter the following:

·1

FINPINGS OF FACT RELATING TO DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearing Committee finds tha.t the Defendant's conduct
is subject to two aggravating factors in this case:
A.

Supstantial experience in the practice of law;

B.

IsSuance of a letter of warning to the Defendant within'
the three years immediately preceding the filing of the
complaint.

2.
The Hearing Committee finds that the Defendant's conduct
is mitigated by the following factors:
A.

Absence of a dishonest or selfish motive

.

B.

Cooperative attitude toward the proceedings

C.

Absence of a prior disciplinary record

NOTE:
The Hearing Committee found as an aggravating factor the
issuance of a letter of warning to the Defendant which was dated
January 12, ~995.
At the same time, the Committee found as a
mitigating factor that MS. Moreno had no prior discipline.
This
apparent inconsistency is occasioned by the fact th~t the issuance
of a letter of warning is specifically listed as an aggravating
factor pursua~t to Rule .0114(w) (1) CK) of Subchapter B of the Rules
of the State Ba~ but, at the same time, is not considered to be
discipline as defined in Rule .0103 of Subchapter B of the Rules
of the State .~ar. Therefore, the Committee finds that Ms. Moreno
does not have a prior disciplinary record which is a mitigating
factor pursuant to Rule .0114{w) (2) CA) of the State Bar Rules.
