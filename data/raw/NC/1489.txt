defined under the Discipline and Disba~ent Rules as: "A finding by the

As Chairman of ~he Grievance Committee of the Notth Carolina State Bar,
it is ~ow my duty to issue this Public Censure and t am cer.tain that you
understand fUlly the spirit in which this duty is performed, t;hat you will
understand the censure, and appreciate its significance. The fact that a
ptibl-ic eensure is not the most ser;tous discipline that may be imposed by the
North Carolina State Bar. should not be taken PY yo,u to indicate that any
member of the Committee 'feels that your conduc't was excusable or less than a
serious and substantial violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility.
You were appoi-nted by Superior Court Judge Julius A. Rosseau, jr. by
order dated December 12, 1,984 to perfect the appeal. 6f F~ank Edward Griffin,
Jr. upon his conviction of criminal charges in Wilkes Co,unty cases f;34 CRS
5541, 5542, a~d 5543. Frank Edward Griffin, Jr.'s sentenee of life
.. imprisonment for his' convictioin of first degree sexual of'fense in 84 CRS 5542
was di'rectly appealable to the -North Carolina Supreme Court. The North
Carolina Supreme Court entered an order bypassing the North Carolina Court of
Appeals in the cases t,hat were not appealable (iirectly to' the North Carolina
Supreme Court. You sought and were granted extensions of time to serve your
proposed record on appeal on the dist"rict attorney up through and including
December 31, 1985. After no proposed record on appeal has been filed with the
district attorney 'by May ·21" 1986, he moved to dism:l,.ss the a,ppeals in Wilkes
County Superior CoUrt and s~heduled his motion for June' 2, 1986. You were
served with this motion. On June 13, 1986, Judge Judson D. DeRamus, Jr.
