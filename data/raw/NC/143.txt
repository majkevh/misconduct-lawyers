Based upon the stipulations of fact and the consent of the parties, the Hearing
Committee hereby finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following
additional

FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.

2.

Clark's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
a.

pattern ofmisconduct;

b.

multiple offenses;

c.

substantial experience in the practice oflaw; and

d.

vulnerability of the victims.

Clark's misconduct is mitigated by the following factors:
a.

absence of a prior disciplinary record;

b.

personal or emotional problems; and

c.

with respect to Claxton, Hart, Tilson, and Kirkham, timely good
faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of
misconduct.

3.

The aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors.

4.

Defendant has engaged in conduct that has caused significant hann to his

clients.
5.
The conduct of Defendant caused actual harm to the standing of the legal
profession, undennining his clients' trust and confidence in lawyers and the legal system.

- 20-

Bar interfered with the State Bar's ability to regulate attorneys and undennined the
privilege oflawyers in this State to remain self-regulating.
7.
This DHC Committee has considered lesser alternatives and finds that a
public censure or reprimand would not be sufficient discipline because of the gravity of
the harm caused by the conduct of the Defendant to the public and to the administration
of justice.
8.
This DHC Committee finds Defendant's conduct caused significant hann
and significant potential hann to clients and to the administration of justice, to the
profession, and to members of the public, and that a more severe discipline is necessary
to protect the public.
9.
For those reasons, this DHC Committee believes and so finds that an
Order calling for a discipline short of a suspension of Defendant's law license would not
be appropriate.

Based upon the foregoing factors and with the consent of the parties, the Hearing
Committee hereby enters the following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
