On July 16 1992, the Grievance Corrmittee of the North Carolina state Bar
met and considered the ,grievances filed against YOu by Charles smith, Mr. &
Mrs • .:;Tames B. Hall, and ·lawrence Rot.hrock. '
,

PursUaht to section 1~ (A) of article IX of the Rules arid Regulations of
tne North carolina state Bar, the G~ievance Committee conducted a preli.minaJ:y
hearing. After considering the information available to it, including your
response to the letter ,of notice, the Grievance Committee found probable
cause. Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable caU$e to believe
that. a member of the Nqrth carolina state Bar is guilty of misconduct
justifying disciplinary action."
'!he rules provide ,that after a fiixling of probable cause, the Grievance
Committee may determirt~ that the filing of ,a complaint and a hearing before
the DisCiplinary Hearing Corrnnission are not required. and the Grievance
Corrnnittee may issue various levels of discipline depend.ing upon the
misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any aggravating or
mitigating factors.· '!he Gri~vance Corrnnittee may issue an admonition,
reprimand, or censure to the respondent attorney.
,
. A reprimand is a written form of discipline more serious than an
admonition issued in cases in whiCh an attorney- has violated one or more
, provisions" of' the RuleS of Professional Conduct and has caused hann or ,
potential hann to a client, the adrninil?tration of justice, the profession, or
a l11eIrlbe+ of the pUblici but the misconduct does not require a censure.

I

'!he Griev9I1C8 Corrnnittee was of tne opinion that a. censure is not required
in this case and issues this reprinand to you. As chairman of the Grievance
Corrnnittee of the North carolina state Bar, it is nCM my duty to issue this
reprimand and I am certain that you will understand fully the spirit in which
this duty is perfonned.
In the st.mtrner of ;1..989, you undertook to handle a bankruptcY proceeding
for Charles L. Smith. You filed a Chapter 11 petition for smith in early May
'1990. You failed to tianclle 'Smith's case with reasonable diligence; in
violation of Rule 6 (B) (3)' of the Rules of Professional COnduct. For instanCe,
on a number of oCcasions, you failed to file monthly reports on a timely basis
with the bankruptcy ad:ministrator. As a partial result of your negJ,.ect, the
bankruptcy administrator, ,filed a motion to dismiss or convert the bankruptcy
proceeding in October 1990. Although you then filed the monthly reports"
avoiding dismissal of the case, you continued to miss deadlines for later
reports. Additionally, you failed to file a proper disclosur? statement for

Even after the Court disapproved. the statement :in Open court in March
you failed to amend the statement on a timely basis.' You also fail~ to
fJ.le a bankruptcy plan for Smith promptly. Finally, on May 6, 1991, a hearing
was held on Centura Bank's motion to foreclose on Smith's house. You
.
discovered that you equld not .attend the hearing, but waited until 4 p.m. on
Friday, May 3 to notify the clerK,lof the bankruptcy yourt bf your problem, by
faxing a letter to the court. Predictably, the equrt did not leru;'n of your
letter in time and. nobody appeared to protect SI1Uth' s interests at the
foreclosure hearing. You failed to l:'epresent Smith in a diligent manner by
your failure to file necesscu:y dOCl..nl"el1ts with the bankruptcy court'~ to
appear at the May 6 hearing.
.
.
Smith.
1~91,

In an unrelated matter, you urrlertook to represent Mr. and Mrs. James B.
Hall in a civil action against one I..arry Ring:. '!he case was set for hearing
on Jan. 2, 1990. You did not appear in court and the matter was dismissed.
You ;Later apparently filed a motion to have the dismissal set aside, but neVer
had the motion heard. Your failure to appear :in cow;:t and to pursue' the
motion to set aside the dismisSal constituted a violation of Rule 6(B) (3) of
the Rules of Profess:i,onal Conduct and resulted.:in prejudice. to your cl~~ts,
:in violation of Rule 7.1(A) (3).

.
Your misconduct regarding Mr. Smith and the Halls is aggravated by your .
failure to respond prornptly to grievances filed by the Halls a,nd iawrence
Rothrock with the N. c. state Bar. The grievances of the Ha;Lls ctnd Rot.1u;ock
were referred to the Grievance Committee of the 21st Judiqial Pistrict..
YotU:
answer to Rot,hrock's grievance was due on May 21, 1991. Your answer to the
Halls' grievance was due on oct. 21, 1991'•. Although you were given various
extensions of time by the local cormnittee, you failed to make any response ..
'!he matters were finally referred back to the state Bar., whiqh gav~ you three
more extensions of time, at your request. Each time you 'promised to respbnd
and each time you failed to keep your word. It was not until you were
subpoenaed to appear :in Raleigh that you made any response whatever. Me
1.1 (B) of the Rules of Professional Conduct require attorneys to respond
promptly to lawful inquiries of a disciplinary authority. You violated this
rule by failing to respond promptly to the gril?vances of the Halls and
Rothrock.
. '
Grievance cormnittee is a~e that you sUffered a personal i;Llness
portion of the time at issue :in these matters and believes that Your
situation
mitigates, but does not excuse your misconduct.
- .....
You are hereby reprimanded by the North carolina state Bar due to your
professional misconduct. The Grievance Committee trusts. that you will heed
this'reprimaild, that it will be remembered by you, that it will be ~eficial
to you, and that you will never aga:in allow yourself to depa,rt from adherence
to the high ethical standards of the legal profession.
