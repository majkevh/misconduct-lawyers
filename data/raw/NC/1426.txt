McNair; and ,agreed to conduct a title search for
McNai-r ..

McNair advised Defendant tha~ he had a deed to
approximatel;y 77 acres of woodla:nd about two miles
south of Plymouth off Route 32. McNair further
advised that: an adj oining iandowner, Jimmy
Harrison, was claiming ownership of approximately
47 acres of McNair's 77 acre tract.

7.

~efendant

sea~ched the title for his client~
Raleigh McNair, and adivsed McNai~ that, in his
opinion" McNair had good title to the 71 acres;.

Defendant fu:rthe,r advised McNair that it could
cost McNair be~weert $4,DDO and $5,000 to settle
the properti dispute with Harrison through court
proceedings .,

Raleig~ McNair advised Defendant that he did not
have the money to put"sue legal action to settle

$3,55U.00 fo~ McNair's property, Raleigh McNair
was a client! of Defendant's who ,had sought legal
advice relating to that very piece of property.
