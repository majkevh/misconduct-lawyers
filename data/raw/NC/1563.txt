PUBLIC RE~

ClARA D. KING, ATIORNEY

Defendant

This Public Reprimand is delivered to you pursuant to section 23.of
Article IX of the Rules and Regulations of the North carolina State. ~a$
ordered by a hearing committee of the DisciplinaJ:y Hear,ing eoI!'lIPission and .l11C!.de .
pursuant to the consent of the North carolina state Bar and you, Clara D. .
King. As a result of the settlement by the parties, the hearing committee
found t:hat you violate:::l the Rules of Professional Conduct of the No:rt.h
carolina state Bar.
.

I

On August 9, 1983, yOlJ were asked by either your. sister, Elizabeth Ann '
King, or your nephew, Jefferson l'1ichael King. Crowder, to prepare a codicil ·to
your father's will. The codicil, dated August 9, 1983, tended. toqbrogate a
prior buy/sale agreement regarding Halifax Linen, Inc. The codicil prevented
your father's business par-Wler from receiving your father's int$rest in
.
Halifax Linen, Inc;::. In addition, the codicil would nave allowed your nephew'
to receive your:: father's interest in the business, including the land qnd
buildings that housed Halifax Linen, Inc.
. Your father suddenly l:?ecaml? ill on August 9,1983, the date tl,1at yQ\:!
prepare::l the ¢Odicil to his will. At the time that you prepared the codicil
for your fa.ther's execution, he 'ivas seriOllSly ill and. later died .in the
hospital on that very same day. Prior to the August 9, 1983 codicil that you
prepared, your father never asked you to prepare such an instrument.
.

-

You admit that two witness8$ and your nephew, Crowder, ;;'lerepr~ent when
you took your father's hand, placed a pen in it, and an "X" was I$de for his
~k on. the codicil.
You do not contest that at the time your father
purportedly executed the codicil, you had doubts as to wnetlier your ·fatber had
sufficient mental ·capacity to make the codicil.
Your conduct violated DRl-102 (A) (5) and (6) of the Code6f Prof8?sional
Respon.sibility. 'DRl-102 (A) (5) and' (6) provide 'th9.t ., II A, lawyer Shall not
engage in professional conduct that is prejudici~ to the adffiinistratio~ of
justice, and engage in any other professional conduct that adversely reflects
on his fitness to . practice .law.!' '. Your preparation and assistance :in your "
father's purported execution of the codicil raises questions both of ethiQa.~ .
and legal impropriety and such conduct could potentially reSult in damage .to
third parties. You should remember that your respQnsibi.lity as Ct li~eQ
attorney is to eXecute your client I s wishes, not thope of a family me.J.tlb$J::" or
other third party.

Apparently, at the time you prepared
COdicil to ,your father's will,
you were functioning under ·an extre.rnely emotional' and trying time as you
watched. your father die. HOvlever, it is most important fqr a la~;yer to
separate his personal feelings from the legal and ethical obligations. tba'c he
may have to pis clie.nt ru"1d the legal system.
.
The hearing comttee is cognizant of the fact that you did not benefit
by your 'action and, in fact., the codicil was against your owh personal
.
financial interest·... The hearing cqmuittee also reccgnizesthat in' 1983, you
~lere an inexper:i,enced.attorney. and yo1J. had never prepared a will," cOdicil, or
any other legal dO-...rUmetlt.

,

The hearing committee' is satisfied that you will never again allow
yourself to depart. from the strict adherence to the. highest standards of the
legal profession. , We believe that you will heed to this Public,Reprimand.
