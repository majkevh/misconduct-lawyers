*********************************
TO:

The Council of the North Carolina State Bar
I, JOSEPH K. BYRD, JR., hereby tender my license to practice law in North

Carolina and desire to resign from the North Carolina State Bar. My resignation is
tendered freely and voluntarily, is not the result of coercion or duress, and I am fully
aware of the implications of submitting the resignation.
I am aware that there is presently pending an investigation regarding allegations
that I am guilty of misconduct, to wit: conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute
between 20 and 40 kilograms of marijuana in violation of Rule 1.2(B) of the Rules of
Professional Conduct.
I acknowledge that the material facts upon which the grievance is predicated are
true.

I am submitting my resignation because I know that if charges were predicated

upon the misconduct under investigation I could not successfully defend against them.
