$7,762.10 to the clieuts listed in the preceding paragraph.
39. Defendant failed to reconcile the individual client ledger balances for the trust
account with the general ledger and adjusted bank statement balances for the trust
account at least quarterly between January I, 2009 and June 30, 2012.
41. Defendant often represented a mobile home dealer regarding transactions in
which the dealer was involved in the sale of mobile homes.
42. To fucilitate the sale of a mobile home to its customer T.C., the dealer helped
T.C. find a buyer for T.C.'s real properly in another county. The dealer arranged for
T.C. to sell T.C.'s property to lB.

5

43. T.C. and J.B. agreed that T.C. would sell the property to J.B. for $110,000.00.
J.B. would pay T.C. $10,000.00 in cash and make payments on T.C.'s existing mortgage
without informing the mortgagee of the sale.
44. All parties came to Defendant's office on or about September 30, 2009 and
the dealer directed Defendant to prepare documents for the sale ofT.C. 's real property to
J.B.
45. On or about September 30, 2009, T.C. and J.B. signed the documents
Defendant prepared. One docwnent was a warranty deed prepared on behalf ofT.C.
conveying the real property to J.B.'s corporate entity. Another document was a
promissory note prepared on behalf of J.B. in which J.B. 's entity promised to pay
$99,865.42 to T.e. in monthly installments over 30 years. A third document was a deed
of trust pledging the property as security for the indebtedness owed by J.B. to T.C.
46. The warranty deed that Defendant prepared did not note that the property was
being conveyed subject to the lien of the existing mortgage. Rather, it stated that the
property was being conveyed free and clear of all encumbrances.
47. The promissory note that Defendant prepared stated that the note was
secured by a deed of trust that was a first lien against the property described in the deed
of trust, when in fact, the existing mortgage was the frrst Hen against the property.
48. T.C. paid Defendant $150.00 for preparing the warranty deed and J.B. paid
Defendant $200.00 for preparing the promissory note and deed of trust.
49. Defendant collected no other funds from the parties other than his fees. J.B.
paid $10,000.00 by certified check directly to T.e.
50. After T.C. and J.B. signed the documents, J.B. took the original warranty
deed and deed of trust purportedly to record them in the other county.
51. Defendant failed to fully inform T.C. and J.B. about his relationship with the
mobile home dealer, that they might benefit from separate lawyers to represent them
because their interests may not be fully aligned, that his representation of them was
limited to preparation of the docunlents and that he was not advising them of their
liabilities, responsibilities and options regarding the transaction other than to describe the
possible acceleration of me indebtedness under T.e.'s existing mortgage.
52. Defendant failed to fully inform T.C. and J.B. that because of his existing
relationship with the mobile home dealer and the dealer's interest in facilitating the sale
of this property so that T.C. could purchase a mobile home from the dealer, Defendant's
loyalty to the dealer might conflict with the interests ofT.C. andlor J.B. in this
transaction.

6

53. Approximately one month after the parties signed the documents in
Defendant's office, the mobile home dealer directed Defendant to prepare a closing
statement regarding the transaction. Defendant prepared a HUD-! fonn, signed it, and
provided it to the mobile home dealer.
54. The HUD-! fonn Defendant prepared did not accurately depict the
transaction. For example, the fonn falsely listed the settlement date as September 1,
2009 instead of September 30, falsely listed Defendant as the settlement agent when
Defendant did not deposit and/or disburse the settlement funds, and falsely showed T.C.
as taking a $100,000.00 deed of trust when the actoal promissory note and deed of trust
was for $99,865.42.
Based on the record and the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Hearing Panel makes

violation of RuJe 8.4(c).
Based on the forgoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and the evidence
presented at the hearing, the Hearing Panel hereby frnds by clear, cogent and convincing
evidence the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I. Defendant has no prior professional discipline.
2. J.B. delayed recording the warranty deed for several months and did not record
for several years the deed of trust securing the loan T.C. made to him. T.C. did not
appear as experienced in business matters as J.B. and the mobile home dealer and she
was unaware of the risks involved in the transaction.
3. Since the initiation of the investigation into his trust accounting practices,
Defendant has not taken any steps to learn the basics of trust accounting management
either throngh CLEs or other programs.
4. Since the initiation of the investigation into his trust accounting practices,
Defendant has not made any efforts to reimburse the trust account for the deficiency that
has existed since June 2012.
5. During the time period at issue in this case, Defendant was delinquent in his
payment of taxes to the IRS and the IRS was garnishing Defendant's bank accounts to
collect outstanding taxes.
6. By comingling his funds with client funds in the trust account, especially at a
time when the IRS was garnishing Defendant's accounts, Defendant placed his clients'
funds at risk and placed his own interests above those of his clients.
7. Defendant caused significant harm and potential significant harm to the clients
whose funds he was required to hold in his trust account but failed to maintain in trust.

9

8. Defendant expressed no remorse for his conduct in handling entrusted funds
and the real estate transaction involving T.C and J.B. Defendant has made no effort to
reimburse the trust account.
9. An injunction prohibiting Defendant from handling entrusted funds was
imposed by the Superior Court of Wake County. Since that time, Defendant has
continued to allow his office to receive payments made on behalf ofD.M.
10. Clients are entitled to representation by attorneys they can trust. A
cornerstone of client trust in an attorney is that the attorney will properly protect and
maintain entrusted funds. Failure to do so erodes the confidence clients place in attorneys
who handle their affairs and harms the public and the profession as a whole.
Based on the established facts and Conclusions of Law above and the additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel makes the following:

CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B § .0114(w)(1) of the Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and concludes that the following factors are present:
(a)

Intent of the Defendant to conuuit acts where the harm or potential harm is
foreseeable;

(b)

Circumstances reflecting the Defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness,
or integrity;

(c)

Elevation of Defendant's own interests above those ofthe clients;

(d)

Impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the
representation; and

(e)

Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication.

2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. 1B § .01 14(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes that the following factors are present:
(a)

Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication; and

(b)

Misappropriation or conversion of assets of any kind to which Defendant
or recipient is not entitled, whether from a client or other source.

10

3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.CA.C. IB § .o114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations ofthe North Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a)

Absence of prior disciplinary offenses in this state or any other
jurisdiction;

(b)

Dishonest or selfish motive;

(c)

Indifference to making restitution;

(d)

Pattern of misconduct;

(e)

Multiple offenses;

(f)

Full and free disclosure to the Hearing Panel and cooperative attitude
toward the proceedings;

(g)

Vulnerability of the victim;

(h)

Degree of experience in the practice oflaw as he has practiced since 1975;

(i)

Lack of reasonable efforts toward interim rehabilitation regarding trust
account management;

(j)

Lack of remorse; and

(k)

Allowing his office to continue to receive client funds after the injunction
prohibiting him from handling entrusted funds was entered.

4.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and finds that a
public censure, reprimand, admonition, or suspension would not be sufficient discipline
because of the gravity of the harm to Defendant's clients, and because of the potential
significant harm Defendant's conduct caused to the public, the administration of justice,
and the legal profession.
5.
The Hearing Panel has considered all lesser sanctions and finds thai
discipline short of disbarment would not adequately protect the public, the profession and
the administration of justice for the following reasons:
(a)

The factors under Rule .01 14(w)(2) that are established by the evidence in
this case are of a nature that support imposition of disbarment as the
appropriate discipline;

11

(b)

Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Defendant committed and
would send the wrong message to attorneys and to the public regarding the
conduct expected of members of the Bar of this state; and

(c)

Protection of the public requires that Defendant not be permitted to
resume the practice oflaw unless and until he demonstrates that he has
reformed, that he understands his obligations as an attorney, officer of the
court, and as a citizen of this state and country. Disbmment is the only
sanction that requires Defendant to demonstrate reformation before he
may resume the practice oflaw.

Based upon the foregoing facts, findings and conclusions, the Hearing Panel
hereby enters the following

ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1.
Defendant, Ertle Knox Chavis, is hereby DISBARRED effective thirty
