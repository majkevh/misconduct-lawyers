January 2016 and resigned his position with the finn effective 30 April 2016.
6.
As an attorney member of the finn, it was Defendant's responsibility to open
client records within the finn's client management system for any client for whom he undertook
representation.
7.
The finn's conflict check system relied upon client records being opened in the

In June 2014, Client D hired Defendant to assist him with a creditor claim in a
bankruptcy matter.
21.
Defendant received a copy of the bankruptcy plan, pursuant to which Client D's
claim would be paid no more than $0.22 on the dollar, rendering Client D's $173,764.72 claim
worth a maximum of approximately $38,000.00.
22.
Client D told Defendant at the outset of the representation that he needed to keep
the costs of the representation as low as possible. Defendant acknowledged this.
23.

Defendant sent invoices to Client D for June and July 2014.

24.

Defendant did not provide Client D with invoices for August or September 2014.

25.
On 28 October 2014, Client D learned that, since 1 August 2014, Defendant had
billed additional fees totaling more than one-half of Client D's maximum recovery on the claim.
26.
Defendant's failure to provide Client D with invoices deprived Client D of the
opportunity to decide how his objectives would best be met before incurring extensive legal fees.
27.
Client D addressed the billing issue With Defendant on 27 May 2015. Defendant
told Client D he would review the past billing and talk with Client D about adjusting the charges ..
28.
Defendant never spoke with Client D about the bills and only communicated once
more with Client D.
29.
In addition to Client D, Defendant failed to send regular billing invoices to
numerous other clients. By April 2015, Defendant had essentially stopped sending invoices to
any of his clients.
30.
Client E hired Defendant in July 2015 to handle an eviction of Client E's tenant
and paid Defendant's $1500 advance fee by check.
31.
Defendant did not deposit the check into the firm trust account but instead kept
the paper check in his client file.
32.
After ascertaining that it would not be possible to obtain a summary eviction on
Client E's behalf, Defendant failed to take additional steps to complete the matter.
33.

Defendant stopped communicating with Client E and stopped returning her calls.

34.
When Client F hired Defendant, she gave him a check for the advance fee.
Defendant failed to deposit this check into the firm trust account and instead kept the paper
check in the client ftle.

The North Carolina State Bar v. Douglas J. Tate
Consent Order of Discipline

Page 3 of12

36.
Client F called Defendant multiple times in October 2015, and Defendant did not
return her calls.
On 30 October 2015, Defendant's assistant forwarded to Defendant an email from
37.
Client F in which Client F asked Defendant to respond.
38.

Defendant never responded.

39.
During the month of November 2015, Client G tried numerous times to reach
Defendant, and Defendant failed to respond to Client G's inquiries.
40.
When Defendant left practice in January 2016, his firm discovered that he had
failed to open proper client records in the firm's client management system for a large number of
matters he had taken on.
41.
Where Defendant had not opened a client record in the firm's system, he had not
performed a conflict check for that client or matter.
42.
In at least seven of these matters for which Defendant had failed to open a proper
client record, he kept an advance fee check in the paper file he maintained.
43.
From August 2012 until July 2015, Defendant had direct supervisory authority
over paralegal Margaret Harmon.
44.

Defendant failed to adequately supervise Harmon.

45.
Unbeknownst to Defendant, Harmon held herself out as an attorney while
working on various matters for Defendant.
46.
Harmon performed work for other attorneys, and the matters she handled for
Defendant were the only matters in which she held herself out as an attorney.
47.
For instance, on 5 March 2013, Harmon sent a letter enclosing a summons and
complaint to Scott Cook in the matter of Shepherd v. Cook, Buncombe County Civil District
Court file no. 13 CV 00145.
48.
The letter said: "As attorney for McGuire, Wood & Bissette, P.A., I hereby serve
you with the enclosed Summons and Complaint pursuant to the laws of the State of North
Carolina."
49.

Harmon signed her name to the letter.

requests for infonnation in violation of Rule 1.4(a)(4);

(e)

By failing to provide Client D with invoices reflecting that Defendant had billed

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and with the consent of
the parties, the Hearing Panel also enters the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE

The fmdings of fact in paragraphs 1 - 49 above are reincorporated as if set forth

herein.
2.
discipline.

Defendant has been practicing law for 26 years and has no prior professional

3.
During the time period relevant to this matter, Defendant was suffering from
severe depression that contributed to Defendant's misconduct. Defendant was receiving
treatment for his depression throughout the time period described in the complaint. Defendant's
ongoing treatment did not help him perceive that he was becoming increasingly unable to fulfill
his professional obligations or take steps to prevent harm to his clients.
4.
In neglecting the matters of multiple clients, failing to communicate with multiple
clients, and failing to complete multiple matters for which he had been retained, Defendant failed
to fulfill his obligations and duties to his clients. Defendant's conduct caused significant
frustration for these clients and impaired their ability to achieve the goals of their representations
by causing unnecessary delay in their cases. In this way, Defendant's conduct had the potential
to cause significant harm.
S.
Defendant's failure to deposit entrusted funds into his firm's trust account as
required by the trust accounting Rules had the potential to cause significant harm to his clients.
The checks could have been lost or stolen, and, to the extent the firm remained unaware of the
funds the clients had already paid, the clients would not get credit from the firm for those funds.
Each of the checks found in Defendant's files has been properly disposed of such that the clients
did not suffer harm.
6.
There is an absence of any evidence that Defendant intended to harm his clients or
that he exhibited a dishonest or selfish motive.
7.
Defendant has acknowledged his conduct violated the Rules of Professional
Conduct and is remorseful for his actions.
Based on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above, the additional Findings of
Fact Regarding Discipline, and the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel makes the
following:
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

The North Carolina State Bar v. Douglas J. Tate
Consent Order of Discipline

Page 6 of 12

I.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fonus of discipline
available to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumer,ated in 27
N.C.A.C. IB ยง.0114(w)(l) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and
concludes the following factors warrant consideration of suspension of Defendant's license:
(a) Negative impact of defendant's actions on client's or public's perception of
the profession; and
(b) Impainuent of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the representation.
2.
The Hearing Panel concludes that none of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
IB ยง .01 14(w)(2) of the RuIes and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar are present in this
case.
,
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
1B ยง.0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and concludes the
following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a) Defendant's lack of prior disciplinary offenses;
(b) Absence of dishonest or selfish motive;
(c) Effect of any personal or emotional problems on the conduct in question;
(d) Remorse; and
(e) Defendant's degree of experience in the practice of law.
4.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and fmds that a censure,
reprimand, or admonition would be insufficient discipline because of the potential significant
harm to clients caused by Defendant's conduct.
5.
Although Defendant's conduct is serious enough to warrant more than a censure,
it does not wan-ant an active suspension of his license.
6.
A stayed suspension of Defendant's law license is wan-anted because entry of an
order imposing less severe discipline wouId fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the
misconduct and would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public about the conduct
expected of members of the Bar of this State.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and the Findings and
Conclusions Regarding Discipline, and with the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel enters
the following:
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE.
