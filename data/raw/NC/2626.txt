CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

I

1. All parties are properly before the hearing committee of the Disciplinary Hearing
Cqrnmission and the hearing committee ha$ jurisdiction over Hugo and the subject matter.
2. Hug;o , s conduct, as set out above, constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N .'C.
Gen. Stat. § 84-28(b)(2) as follows:
.

(a)

by failing to respond to l;I, lawful demand for information from a disciplinary
authority, the' October 17, 2005 Letter of Notice and its attachment, Hugo violated

BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Conclusions of Law, and the evidence
presented at the hearing, the hearing committee hereby makes the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. I-Jugo's misconduct is aggravate4 by the following factor:
(a)

I

A prior disciplinary offense:
An Admonition issued by the Grievartce COllll11ittee in 05G0260
for continuing to practice law after being notified of an
administrative suspension and failing to file a timely respons~ to
the letter of notice issued in that case.

2. Hugo's misconduct is mitigated by the following factors:
(a)

Absence of a dishonest or selfish motive;

3. The aggravating factor outweighs the mitigating factor.
4. After Hugo failed to respond to the tetter of Notice issued in this case., the
State Bar conducted an investigation that did not show that Hugo had engaged in conduct
that warranted disCipline in his representation of Lawrence W. However, the State Bar
wOl.lld not have had to conduct that investigation if Hugo had simply responded to the
Letter of Notice.

I

5. Entry of an order imposing lesser discipline than aRepriJnand would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of Hugo's failure to attend to his obligation to abide by the
rules of the North Carolina State Bar conce11ling the administration of the c1isciplinary
process.
BASED UPON the foregoing Findings QfFact Regarding Discipline apd the consent of
the parties, the hearing committee hereby enters the following:
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1. The appropriate 4iscipline to be imposed against Hugo is a Reprimand. The
Reprimand is contained in a separate document of even date herewith.
2. Hugo is taxed with the costs of this action as assessed by the Secretary.

REPRIMAND

This matter was considered by a hearing committee of the Disciplinary Hearing
.
Cominission composed ofT. Richard Kane, Chair; John Breckenridge Regan, and Donald G,
Willhoit. The he~ng committee's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order of
Discipline were entered of even date herewith.
'
)

The hearing committee found that you had violated one of the Revised Rules of
Professional Conduct, and ordered that you be Reprimanded. A Reprimandis a written fo1'l11 of '
discipline more serious than a)1 Admonition issued in cases in which an attorney has violated one
or more provisions of the Revised Rules of ProfessioJ}al Conduct and has caused harm or
potential harm to a client, the administration of justice, the profession, or a member of the public;'
but the misconduct does not require a Censure. This document constitutes that Reprimand.

I

On ,October 17, 2005, you were sent a Letter of Notice in a grievance pending before the,
State Bar's Grievance Committee by certified m&il that directed you to respond to the substance
of the grievance that was attached to the letter within 15 days of receipt. On November 29,
2005, you were served with the Letter of Notice and the substance of the grievance. Although
'you requested, and were granted, an extension of time to respond to the Letter ofNotice,'You
failed to do so. By failing tQ respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary
authority, the October 17,2005 Letter of Notice and its attachment, yot} violated Rule 8.1(b).
Although the State Bar's subsequent indepep,dent invest\gation of your representation of the
complainant failed to show that your conduct warranted discipline, that investigatIon would not
have been necessary had you simply responded to the Letter of Notice.
The hearing committee of the Piscipljnary Hearing Commission hereby Reprimands you
for your professional misconduct. The hearing cOmniittee hopes that you will heed this
Reprimand, that it wili be remembered by you, that it will be beneficial to you, and that YOll will
never again allow yowse1f to depart from adherence to the high ethical standards of the legal
profession.

I
