before the committee is that the Defendant aSsisted in Some

'I

of The North Carolina State Bar this Public Censu,re is deliveredtQ you.

You

have been found to have vi-olated the Canons ofEth-i cs ,of The ,Nor~hCarol i na
State Bar by a hearing committee of the Discipl;·na;ry 'Heari"ng Comrtds;s;:on
sitting on November 10, 1978.'
The fact that th;-s Public Censure;'s not the most ser;Ouso.f
possible discipline provided for in General Statute 84-28,' should not be taken .'

I

by you to indicate that The North Carolina State Bar in C\ny way feels that
your conduct in thi s matter was excusable or was. consi dered by the members
of the hearing committee .of the Disciplinary Hearing
less than a v.ery serious and

sl,lbstanti~l

ComlTi;ssio~

to pe any

violation of the Canons of Ethics

,.
You were ap:po'inted to perfect the appeal of Maylon. Theo Whitley,
and you did not perfect the appeal and did not withdraw as counsel for
Mr. Whitley. At no t:ime did Mr. Whitley give consent to your abandonlJ1ent of
the appeal.
,

Your conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice. This
conduct is a direct violation of the Canons of Ethics of The North Carolina
I

State Bar and in addition is a reflection upon you and the entire Bar of this
State.

Your conduct was unprofessiOnal.

It violated not only the letter

. but also the spirit of the Code of Professional Responsibility of The North
Carol ina State Bar.

:It was not such conduct as is expected of a member of

the legal profession.

It brings discredit upon you and tends to place the

courts of this State and your fellow members of the Bar in disrepute and
further damages both in the eyes of the public.
Failure of attorneys to represent clients within the law and within
I

the bounds of the Canons of Ethics and the Code of Professional Responsibility
of The North Carolina State Bar is the most serious complaint against our
profession, and your failure to represent Maylon Theo Whitley adequately was
your error here.

You placed a privilege that you hold as a lawyer to serve

the public in serious jeopardy.
I

The North

State Bar is confident that this Public Censure

C~rolina

wi 11 be heeded by you ~ that it wi 11 be remembered by you, and that it wi 11 be
beneficial to you.

W~

are confident that you will never again allow yourself

to depart from strict'adherence to the highest standards of the legal
profession. Accordingly, we sincerely trust that this Public Censcrre, instead
oT being a burden, will actually serve as a profitable reminder to weigh
carefully your responsibility to the public, your clients, your fellow
I

•

attorneys, and the cot.jrt, with the result that you will be known a.s a
respected member of our profession whose word and conduct may be relied upon
without

question~

Pursuant to ,Section 23 of the Rules of Disciplinary Procedure, it
,

is ordered that a
judg~ent

cert;fi~d

copy of thi s Publ i·e Censure be entered upon the

docket of the Supe.rior Court of Wake County and al so upon the

minutes of the Supreme Court of North Carolina.
