ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

This matter was heard by a Hearing Panel of the Disciplinary Hearing Commission
composed ofR. Lee Fanner, Chair, and members William O. King and Jane B. Weathers
pursuant to North Carolina Administrative Code, Title 27, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, ยง
.0114(h). Plaintiff was represented by Deputy Counsel Margaret T. Cloutier. Defendant
made no appearance, but was properly served with process and was duly notified of the
hearing in this matter.
Asbill failed to file a responsive pleading in this matter and on May 23, 2017 the
Hearing Panel entered an Order Pursuant to Default against Asbill in which the allegations in
the Plaintiffs complaint were deemed admitted and concluding as a matter of law that Asbill
violated the Rules of Professional Conduct set forth in the complaint.
Based upon the pleadings in this matter and the Order Pursuant to Default entered by
the Hearing Panel, the Hearing Panel finds by clear, cogent and convincing evidence the
following:
FINDINGS OF FACT
Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar ("State Bar"), is a body duly
I.
organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this
proceeding under the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North
Carolina, and the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar (Chapter I of
Title 27 of the North Carolina Administrative Code).
2.
Defendant, Craig Owen Asbill ("Defendant" or "Asbill"), was admitted to
the North Carolina State Bar on August 18, 2000 and is, and was at all times referred to
herein, an attomey at law licensed to practice law in North Carolina, subject to the laws
of the State ofNmih Carolina, the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar
and the Rules of Professional Conduct.

3.
During all or part of the relevant periods referred to herein, Defendant was
engaged in the practice oflaw in the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office
in Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, NOllh Carolina.
4.
In October 2009 Defendant undertook to represent Anthony Jenkins in
connection with a personal injury claim stemming from an automobile accident in which
Jenkins was involved on June 8, 2009.
5.
Under the applicable statute of limitations for Jenkins' claim, the period
within which he could file a lawsuit expired on June 8, 2012, after which Jenkins would
be legally prohibited from recovering for his damages.
6.
Defendant did not settle Jenkins' claim and did not file a lawsuit on
Jenkins' behalf before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period.
7.
On Juoe 8,2012, Defendant emailed the insurance company's
representative requesting that Jenkins' claim be arbitrated under the provisions of the
insurance policy.
8.
Defendant's request for arbitration emailed to the insurance company was
not timely or properly made.
9.
Defendant's request for arbitration without filing a lawsuit did not toll the
statute of limitations on Jenkins' claim.
10.
On November 6,2012, the insurance company filed a lawsuit against
Jenkins requesting the court to declare that the insurance company had no obligation to
pay any claim made by Jenkins based on the expiration of the statute of limitations
period.
II.
Also on November 6, 2012, the attorney for the insurance company mailed
a copy ofthe lawsuit to Defendant.
12.
the lawsuit.

Shortly thereafter, Jenkins was served by a deputy sheriff with a copy of

13.
Shortly after he was served, Jenkins contacted Defendant's office and
notified Defendant's paralegal that he had received a copy of the lawsuit.
14.
Defendant took no steps to defend Jenkins against the lawsuit filed by the
msurance company.
15.
Defendant did not communicate to Jenkins at any time that Defendant's
representation of Jenkins did not include representation in the lawsuit the insurance
company filed due to Defendant's failure to file a complaint for Jenkins before the filing
period under the statute of limitations expired.

2

16.
The insurance company obtained a judgment by default declaring that the
insurance company had no further obligation to pay any claims made by Jenkins
17.
In August 2013 Jenkins learned of the judgment by speaking to the Clerk
of Court and promptly notified Defendant's paralegal.
18.

Defendant took no steps to set aside the default judgment.

19.
Defendant did not explain to Jenkins the import of the default judgment.
Instead, when Jenkins spoke to Defendant in early April 2015, Defendant told Jenkins
that he would be seeking arbitration with the insurance company on Jenkins' claim within
two weeks, despite Defendant's knowledge that the court had determined that the statute
oflimitations precluded any claims made by Jenkins.
20.
Jenkins attempted to contact Defendant about the status of his claim many
times during the representation but often received no return contact. Jenkins also left
messages for Defendant in June, July and August 2014 and for several weeks after early
April 2015 when Defendant said he would seek arbitration. Defendant did not return
Jenkins' phone calls.
21.
Jenkins filed a grievance against Defendant with the North Carolina State
Bar concerning Defendant's handling of Jenkins' claim.
22.
Defendant was notified of the grievance on or near August 11,2015 and
was required to respond within fifteen days.
23.

Defendant did not respond to the grievance until January 11,2016.

24.
In his response, Defendant falsely stated that during the first few months
of2013, Defendant continued to leave messages for the attorney for the insurance
company in an attempt to schedule arbitration of Jenkins' claim, but that the attorney
would not return the calls.
25.
In his response, Defendant falsely stated that, in late 2013 or early 2014,
the arbitrator Defendant had engaged offered to contact the attorney for the insurance
company to schedule arbitration, and informed Defendant that after multiple attempts to
contact the attorney for the insurance company, the attorney for the insurance company
would not return the arbitrator's calls.
26.
On March 8, 2016 the State Bar sent Defendant a letter requesting
additional information to which he was required to respond by March 17, 2016.
27.

Defendant did not respond to the March 8, 2016 letter.

Based upon the pleadings, the Order Pursuant to Default, and the foregoing Findings
of Fact, the Hearing Panel enters the following:

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. All parties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the Panel has jurisdiction
over Defendant and the subject matter of this proceeding.
2. Asbill's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes grounds for
discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(2) as follows:
(a)

By failing to timely or properly request arbitration from the insurance
company without filing a lawsuit to preserve Jenkins' claim before the
expiration of the statute oflimitations period, and by failing to take any
steps to defend Jenkins against the lawsuit filed by the insurance company
or to set aside the default judgment after he became aware of it,
Defendant failed to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client
in violation of Rule 1.3;

(b)

By failing to explain to Jenkins that the default judgment precluded
Jenkins' claim, by continuing to claim that arbitration could still be
requested after the court declared that any claim by Jenkins was barred.
and by failing to respond to Jenkins' calls, Defendant failed to keep his
client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, failed to
promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and failed to
explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to pelmit the client to
make informed decisions regarding the representation in violation of Rule
1.4(a)(3) and (4) and 1.4(b);

(c)

By failing to timely respond to the grievance and failing to respond to the
letter requesting additional information, Defendant knowingly failed to
respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority
in violation of Rule 8.l(b); and

(d)

By implying to Jenkins that arbitration could still be requested after the
court declared that any claim by Jenkins was barred, by making false
statements in his response to the grievance about Defendant's efforts and
the arbitrator's efforts to contact the insurance company's attorney,
Defendant engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or
misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c).

3.
Asbill's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes
grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(3) as follows:
(a)
For knowing misrepresentation of any facts or circumstances surrounding
any complaint, allegation, or charge of misconduct; andlor
(b)
For failure to answer the formal inquiry issued by the North Carolina State
Bar in a disciplinary matter.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and the
additional evidence presented at the hearing, the Hearing Panel finds by clear, cogent, and
convincing evidence the following:

FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
Asbill's multiple violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct demonstrates
his unwillingness to adhere to the IUles enacted for the purpose of protecting the public.
2.
Asbill failed to protect the interests of Jenkins in his personal injury claim,
precluding Jenkins from accessing the courts to attempt to recover compensation for his
injuries and pay his medical expenses.
3.
Jenkins was a vulnerable victim of Asbill's misconduct and was harmed by his
conduct. Jenkins was unfamiliar with the legal process and had limited financial resources.
Jenkins relied upon Asbill to protect and pursue his legal rights.
4.
Asbill failed to return the calls of other clients and/or otherwise neglected their
cases. In at least one instance, Asbill failed to respond to discovery in a client's lawsuit,
causing the lawsuit to be dismissed. That client will likely incur an additional filing fee to
reinstate his lawsuit.
5.
Clients are entitled to representation by attorneys they can tlUSt to accomplish
their goals. A cornerstone of client tlUSt in an attorney is that the attorney will properly
protect and maintain the client's interests. Failure to do so erodes the confidence clients place
in attorneys who handle their affairs and harms the public and the profession as a whole.
6.
By failing to respond to State Bar inquiries and otherwise failing to participate
in the grievance process, Asbill caused significant harm to the profession. Such conduct
interferes with the State Bar's ability to regulate its members and undermines the profession's
privilege to remain self-regulating.
7.
Asbill has a profile on a lawyer directory website. Multiple negative reviews
have been posted by the public on this profile, noting Asbill's neglect of their cases and
failure to adequately communicate with them.
8.
Asbill's conduct caused potential significant harm to the standing of the legal
profession in the eyes of the public in that such conduct by attorneys erodes the trust of the
public in the profession, as evidenced by negative reviews posted by the public on the
internet. Confidence in the legal profession is a building block for public tlUst in the entire
legal system.
9.
Asbill was sued by a firm with which he was previously associated. That
action resulted in multiple orders of the comi with which Asbill failed to comply. Asbill was
ultimately held in contempt of court for those failures and served 20 days in jail. Asbill's
failure to comply with multiple orders of the court in that action shows his unwillingness to
submit to a tribunal's authority.

5

10.
By engaging in various instances of client neglect, failing to communicate
with his client, and failing to respond to the Bar, Asbill committed multiple offenses and
displayed a pattern of misconduct. At the time of his conduct, Asbill knew or should have
known that his actions could harm his client and the administration of justice.
11.

Asbill has no prior professional discipline.

Based on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IE ยง .01 14(w)(I) of the Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and concludes the following factors warrant suspension:
(a) Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential harm is
foreseeable;
(b) Circumstances reflecting Defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness, or
integrity;
(c) Negative impact of Defendant's actions on his client's and the public's
perception of the profession;
(d) Negative impact of Defendant's actions on the administration of justice;
(e) ImpaiIment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the representation;
and
(f) Multiple instances offailure to participate in the legal profession's selfregulation process.
2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง .OlI4(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the Nmth Carolina State
Bar and concludes that although one factor is present the circumstances of this case do
not warrant disbannent in order to protect the public.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง .OII4(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a) Lack of prior professional discipline;
(b) A pattern of misconduct;

6

(c) Multiple offenses;
(d) Absence of full and free disclosure to the hearing panel or cooperative
attitude toward the proceedings;
(e) Refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct;

(f) Vulnerability of victim;
(g) Extensive experience in the practice of law; and
(h) Lack of effort to rectify the consequences of his misconduct by failing to
defend the insurance company's lawsuit against Jenkins or file postjudgment motions.
4.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fOlms of
discipline available to it. An admonition, reprimand, or censure would not be sufficient
discipline because of the gravity ofthe harm or potential harm Defendant's conduct
caused to the public, the administration of justice, and the legal profession.
5.
The Hearing Panel further concludes that such discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the violations committed by Defendant and send the
wrong message to attorneys regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar in this
State.
6.
For these reasons, this Hearing Panel finds that an order imposing
discipline short of suspension would not be adequate or appropriate.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and the Findings
of Fact and Conclusions Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
