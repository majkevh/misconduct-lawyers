CENSURE

II

On January 19,2006, the Grievance Committee oIthe North Carolina State Bar met and
considered the ~eVa:hce filed against you-by the North Catolina State Bar.
Pursuant to section .0.1 13 (a) of the Discipline and Disability Rules of the North Carolina State
Bar, the Grievance Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the information
available to it, including your response to the letter-ofnotice, the Gri~vance Committee"found pro~able
caUse. Probable cause is defl11ed in the rules as "reasonable cause to believe that a member of the North
Carolina State Bar is guilty of misconduct justifying disciplinary action."
\

The rul~s_ provide that after a.finding of probable cause, :the Grievance Committee'may
determine that $e filing of a complaint and a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing Commission ar~
not required and the Grievance Committee may issue various levels of discipline depending upon the
misconduct, thei actual or potential injury -caused, and any aggravating or -mitigating factors. The
Grievance Committee may issue an admo~tion, a reprimand; ot- a censure.
-

-

A censure is a Written fortn of discipline more serious than a repPmal1d, issued in cases in whic}l
an attorney has violated one ot more provisions ofthe-Ruies ofProfe$sional Conduct and has caused
-significant harm or potential significant harm to a client, the administration of justice, the profession or
a member of the public, but the misconduct does not requite suspension of the attorney's license.

I

The Grievance CeHiinitlee believes that a hearing before the PisciplinaryHearing Commi~sion

is not requited ib. this case and issues this _censure to you. As chairman of the Grievance Committee of
the North <;:atolina S1ate Bar, it is now my duty to issue this censure.
In 20Q3, you were appointed to represent 1. P., Who Was charged with being an accessory after
the fact to murder, You sent some discovery ~equests to the state, but most the work in the case
was done by YOW law partner. : Neither you nor your partner obtained consent of the court and I. P.
before effectivel~ substituting your pa:rmer as I. P.'s attorney, however. In so doing, you engaged in
conduct prejudicial to the admInistration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d) and failed to
communicate ad~quately with the client in violation of Rule 1.4. Se-e RPC 58.

of

In June 2004, about a year after you were appointed to the 1. P. case, 1. P.' s mother cont~cted

you about helpmg her son get released on bond. At this. time, neither you nor"yout papner had made
any effort to adc4"ess the bond ~ssue, although the assistant DA assigned to the case indicated that she

would have consented to a bond motion at any time in 2004. ~stead of asking yeur Partner to pursue

iS$ue for J. P.,- you accepted a fee of$5,500 from I. P.'s mother. By doing so, you collected

excessive fee in Violation of RUle 1.5.

Your misconduct is. aggravated by the fact that you took advantage of MrS. P. 's lack of
sophistication aAd by the. fact that you have previously been ''disciplined by the StateBar.
