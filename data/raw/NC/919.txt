This matter was considered by a Hearing Panel of the Disciplinary Hearing Commission
composed of Fred M. Morelock, Chair, and members Renny W. Deese and Patti Head pursuant
to 27 N.C. Admin. Code 1B § .0114 of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State

of fact and conclusions of law recited in this consent order and to the discipline imposed.
Defendant freely and voluntarily waives any and all right to appeal the entry of this consent order
of discipline. Based upon the stipulations of fact and the consent of the parties, the Hearing
Panel hereby finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT
1.
Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar ("State Bar"), is a body duly organized
under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this proceeding under the
authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, and the Rules and
Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar (Chapter 1 of Title 27 of the North Carolina
Administrative Code).
2.
Defendant, Jonathan S. McElroy ("McElroy"), was admitted to the North
Carolina State Bar in 1999, and is, and was at all times referred to herein, an attorney at law
licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the laws of the State of North Carolina, the
Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and the Rules of Professional Conduct.
3.
During all or part of the relevant periods referred to herein, Defendant was
engaged in the practice of law in the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office in
Asheville, Buncombe County, North Carolina.
4.
Defendant was properly served with process, a hearing in this matter was set, and
the matter came before the Hearing Panel with due notice to all parties.

5.
From about May 1, 1999 to January 31,2006, Defendant maintained an attorney
trust account at Bank of America. From about September 6,2002 to August 5,2014, Defendant
maintained an attorney trust account at Wells Fargo.
6.
During the periods of time recited above that Defendant maintained an attorney
trust account, Defendant engaged in the following conduct:
a. Defendant routinely failed to conduct monthly and quarterly reconciliations of the
trust account(s);
b. Defendant failed to accurately identify and track, per client, the funds received
and disbursed for each client;
c. Defendant failed to show on certain trust account checks the client against whose
balance in the trust account funds were being disbursed by said check, or did not
accurately show the client against whose balance in the trust account funds were
being disbursed;
d. Defendant failed to show on trust account deposit records the client to whom the
funds being deposited into the trust account belonged, or did not accurately show
the client to whom the funds belonged;
e. Defendant disbursed funds for clients by methods, including counter withdrawals,
that failed to identify the client against whose balance in the trust account the
disbursements were being made;
f.

Defendant wired attorney fees to himself from his trust account on mUltiple
occasions without any record in the bank documents identifying the client against
whose balance in the trust account the disbursements were being made;

g. Defendant commingled his funds with client funds, both by depositing his
personal funds into the trust account and by leaving earned fees in the trust
account;
h. Defendant failed to appropriately disburse funds in real estate transactions,
including by failing to make designated disbursements, by disbursing more or less
than he should have, and by making disbursements not listed on the HUD-l
Settlement Statement;
i.

Defendant failed to timely complete final title opinions and disburse title
insurance premiums from real estate closings; and

j.

Defendant disbursed more funds from his trust account for clients than he had in
the trust account for the clients.

7.
In about July 2014, at Defendant's request made pursuant to the State Bar's
request for trust account records, AM attempted to reconcile client balances and the trust
account. In the course of this activity, AM made changes to Defendant's records and attempted
The North Carolina State Bar v. Jonathan S. McElroy
Order of Discipline

Page 2 of15

to have positive balances disbursed, negative balances fixed, and other errors corrected. In the
course of doing so, Defendant disbursed $316.00 to himself from client MP's funds in the trust
account, of which Defendant was at most only entitled to $95.00.
8.
On August 5, 2014, Defendant was enjoined by Consent Order of Preliminary
Injunction from any further handling of entrusted funds.
9.
Defendant did not make any arrangements that would enable him to continue to
represent clients in real estate closings while not handling entrusted funds pursuant to the
Consent Order of Preliminary Injunction. Consequently, the Consent Order of Preliminary
Injunction effectively terminated his representation of clients who had retained him to close their
real estate transactions and engage in the attendant receipt and disbursement of funds. Yet
Defendant did not return client files to clients or otherwise act to protect their interests.
10.
Defendant failed to inform clients with pending and upcoming real estate
transactions that he was enjoined from handling entrusted funds and of his consequent inability
to close their upcoming real estate transactions.
II.
After the filing of the Consent Order of Preliminary Injunction, Defendant was
generally unavailable to his clients and failed to respond to his clients' requests for information
concerning upcoming real estate closings.
12.
In about July 2014, clients KC and NC (the Cs) retained Defendant to represent
them in a small claims matter, and informed him of an upcoming court date.
13.
Defendant indicated to the Cs that he would obtain a continuance of the hearing
date in their small claims case.
14.
The Cs contacted Defendant's office the day prior to their court date in the small
claims case and were told Defendant had gotten the hearing date continued and that Defendant
would inform them of the rescheduled date. Accordingly, the Cs did not go to court on the
scheduled hearing date in their small claims case.
15.

Defendant had not obtained a continuance ofthe hearing date.

16.

Defendant did not appear for the Cs at the hearing in their small claims case.

17.
The hearing occurred as scheduled in the Cs' small claims case and judgment was
entered against the Cs.
18.
The Cs made multiple attempts to communicate with Defendant about their small
claims case and have requested their client file from Defendant. Defendant has failed to respond
to the Cs' inquiries and has failed to provide them with their client file.
19.
follows:

Defendant failed to comply with requests for information from the State Bar as

The North Carolina State Bar v. Jonathan S. McElroy
Order of Discipline

Page 3 of15

a. The State Bar served Defendant with a subpoena on June 3, 2014 requiring
production of trust account records in grievance file 14G0542, including client
file documents such as HUD-l Settlement Statements. Defendant failed to
provide the client file documents; and
b. The State Bar served Defendant with letters of notice in grievance files 14G0894
and 14G0995 on October 28, 2014. Defendant did not respond to either letter of
notice.
Based upon the above stipulated facts and with the consent of the parties, the Hearing
Panel hereby makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
All the parties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the Hearing Panel has
jurisdiction over the Defendant, Jonathan S. McElroy, and the subject matter.
1.
The Defendant's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes
grounds for discipline as follows:
(a)

By failing to reconcile his trust accounts monthly and quarterly, Defendant failed
to conduct the requisite reconciliations of his trust accounts in violation of Rules
l.l5-3(d)(l) and (2);

(b)

By failing to accurately track, per client, the funds received and disbursed for
each client, Defendant failed to properly identify and maintain entrusted funds in
violation of Rule l.l5-2(a);

(c)

By failing to show on cancelled checks the client against whose balance in the
trust account funds were being disbursed by said check and by failing to show on
trust account deposit records the client to whom the funds being deposited into the
trust account belonged, Defendant failed to maintain required minimum records
for his trust account in violation of Rules 1.15-3(b)(l) and (2);

(d)

By disbursing funds by methods that failed to show the name of the client against
whose balance in the trust account funds were being disbursed, including by
counter withdrawals and by wires to himself of attorney's fees, Defendant failed
to maintain required minimum records for his trust account in violation of Rule
l.l5-3(b)(3) and used an improper item to disburse fees or expenses to himself in
violation of Rule l.l5-2(h);

(e)

By depositing personal funds into his trust account and leaving earned fees in his
trust account, Defendant failed to maintain entrusted funds separate from his
property in violation of Rule 1.15-2(a) and deposited funds belonging to him into
a trust account in violation of Rule l.l5-2(i);

The North Carolina State Bar v. Jonathan S. McElroy
Order of Discipline

Page 4 of15

(f)

By failing to disburse funds in accordance with the HUD-I Settlement Statement
and/or otherwise as designated for disbursement, Defendant failed to properly
maintain and disburse entrusted funds in violation of Rule US-2(a) and (m);

(g)

By failing to timely complete final title opinions and disburse title insurance
premiums for clients, Defendant failed to act with reasonable diligence and
promptness in representing a client in violation of Rule 1.3 and failed to properly
disburse entrusted funds in violation of Rule I.1S-2(m);

(h)

By failing to appear for the Cs at the hearing in their small claims case and failing
to take any action on their behalf in their small claims case, Defendant failed to
act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client in violation
of Rule 1.3;

(i)

By disbursing to himself funds in excess of the amount to which he was entitled
from the client funds of MP in his trust account, and by disbursing more funds for
clients than he had in his trust account for said clients, Defendant failed to
properly maintain and disburse funds in violation of Rule 1.IS-2(a), (j), and (m);

(j)

By failing to inform clients for whom his representation included receiving and
disbursing entrusted funds ofthe filed Consent Order of Preliminary Injunction
that prevented him from carrying out that representation and by failing to return
client files to such clients and/or making any alternate arrangements for such
clients, Defendant failed to keep his clients informed in violation of Rule 1.4(a)(3)
and (b) and failed to protect his clients' interests upon termination ofthe
representation in violation of Rule 1.16-(d);

(k)

By failing to respond to the inquiries of clients who had retained Defendant for
real estate transactions as well as the inquiries of the Cs regarding their small
claims case, Defendant failed to communicate with his clients in violation of Rule
1.4(a)(4); and

(I)

By failing to provide documents subpoenaed from him by the State Bar and
failing to respond to letters of notice from the State Bar with which he had been
served, Defendant knowingly failed to respond to lawful demands for information
from a disciplinary authority in violation of Rule 8.I(b).

2.
Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28(b)(3), for failure to answer the formal inquiry
issued by the North Carolina State Bar in a disciplinary matter.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and with the consent
of the parties, the Hearing Panel finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.

Defendant has substantial experience in the practice oflaw.

The North Carolina State Bar v. Jonathan S. McElroy
Order of Discipline

Page 5 of15

2.

There is no evidence of any dishonest or selfish motive on the part of Defendant.

3.
Defendant's failure to diligently and accurately monitor and track the funds he
deposited into and disbursed from his trust account per client resulted in flawed, nntrustworthy
internal trust account records and a significant amount of funds for whom the client on whose
behalf the funds were in the trust account could not be identified.
4.
Defendant's conduct in overdisbursing entrusted funds from his trust account
caused potential significant harm to his clients whose entrusted funds were at risk of being
misused for the benefit of someone other than the beneficial owner of the funds without their
knowledge or consent. The overdisbursements also caused potential significant harm by creating
the risk that those clients who had funds in the trust account at the time ofthe overdisbursements
would be found to have had their entrusted funds misused and thus receive less than the amount
that should have been in the trust account for them.
5.
Defendant's failure to timely complete final title opInIOns and disburse title
insurance premiums impaired his clients' ability to achieve the goals of their respective
representations by delaying the conclusion of their real estate transactions and compromising
their financial ability to do so.
6.
The lenders in the residential real estate transactions closed by Defendant were
vulnerable clients in that it was solely through Defendant that the title insurance premium from
the loan proceeds held by Defendant in his trust account could be disbursed to the title insurance
company and the title policy obtained.
7.
The title insurance companies are third parties affected by Defendant's failure to
timely disburse title insurance premiums and complete fmal title opinions. Defendant's failure to
pay the premium and provide the necessary final title opinion impedes the title insurance
company's ability to issue title policies.
8.
Conducting quarterly reconciliations of the trust account is the lynchpin of proper
maintenance and protection of entrusted funds. Had Defendant been conducting quarterly
reconciliations, he would have seen balances remaining for various clients which would have
signaled that work, such as obtaining the title policy, still need to be done in the file.
Additionally, had Defendant been conducting quarterly reconciliations, he would have also had
to identity the funds in his trust account and would have maintained awareness of whose funds
were in his trust account and the appropriate disbursement of those funds. Defendant's
continued failure to reconcile his trust account and failure to maintain proper trust account
records demonstrates a pattern of misconduct and demonstrates Defendant's intent to commit
acts where the potential harm is foreseeable.
9.
Defendant's conduct - allowing client funds to be improperly maintained or
disbursed, even if inadvettently - placed entrusted funds at risk and had the potential to cause
significant harm to the standing of the profession in the eyes of the public because it shows his
disregard for his duties as an attorney. Such erosion of public confidence in attorneys tends to
sully the reputation of, and fosters disrespect for, the profession as a whole. Confidence in the
legal profession is a building block for public trust in the entire legal system.
The North Carolina State Bar v. Jonathan S. McElroy
Order of Discipline

Page 6 of15

10.
Defendant's failure to respond to the inquiries and demands from the State Bar
hampered and delayed the State Bar's audit of his trust account and ability to identify funds in
the trust account. His failure to respond to the State Bar interfered with the State Bar's ability to
regulate attorneys and undermined the privilege oflawyers in this State to remain self-regulating.
II.
Defendant failed to notify clients and respond to inquiries when the Consent
Order of Preliminary Injunction was entered, significantly impacting clients with upcoming
scheduled real estate transactions. Such clients had to find other attorneys to close their
transactions. Some clients had to pay again, or arrange for another to pay, money they needed to
bring to closing but which was frozen in Defendant's trust account.
12.
Defendant failed to appear in court for the Cs and failed to otherwise protect their
interests, resulting in judgment being entered against the Cs and taking away their opportunity to
present their case.
13.

Defendant has no prior disciplinary offenses.

14.
Defendant has experienced substance abuse problems and mental health problems
during the time period at issue in the Complaint in this case.
15.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of discipline
available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and disbarment, in
considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, and with the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel makes the
following:
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of discipline
available to it.

2.
The Hearing Panel considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code IB § .OI14(w) of the Discipline and Disciplinary Rules of the North Carolina State Bar.
3.
The Hearing Panel concludes that the following factors from § .OI14(w)(I),
which are to be considered in imposing suspension or disbarment, are present in this case:
(a)

intent of the defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential harm is
foreseeable;

(b)

Defendant's actions had a potential negative impact on his clients' and the
public's perception of the legal profession;

(c)

impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the representation;

(d)

effect of Defendant's conduct on third parties; and

The North Carolina State Bar v. Jonathan S. McElroy
Order of Discipline

Page 7 of15

(e)

multiple instances of failure to participate in the legal profession's self-regulation
process.

4.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in § .0114(w)(2)
of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and concludes no factors are
present in this instance that would warrant disbarment.
5.
The Hearing Panel concludes that the following factors from § .0114(w)(3),
which are to be considered in all cases, are present in this case:
(a)

absence of prior disciplinary offenses;

(b)

absence of a dishonest 01' selfish motive;

(c)

a pattern of misconduct;

(d)

multiple offenses;

(e)

effect of any personal or emotional problems on the conduct in question;

(f)

vulnerability of Defendant's clients; and

(g)

Defendant's substantial experience in the practice oflaw.

6.
Defendant's failure to properly maintain entrusted funds caused significant harm
and potential significant harm to his clients.
7.
Defendant's conduct caused significant harm to his buyer and lender clients,
whose funds were not properly maintained and disbursed and who did not receive the desired
product ofthe intended disbursements (e.g. title policies).
8.
Defendant's conduct caused potential significant harm to both his clients and to
the title insurance companies. The absence of title policies could have been, or could be in the
future, significantly harmful to the client and the title insurance company if a title issue arose or
arises.
9.
Defendant's failure to appear in court for the Cs and failure to otherwise protect
their interests caused significant harm to the Cs.
10.
Defendant's failure to notify clients and respond to inquiries when the Consent
Order of Preliminary Injunction was entered caused significant harm to clients with upcoming
scheduled real estate transactions.
11.
Defendant's failure to respond to the inquiries and demands from the State Bar
resulted in significant harm to the profession, interfering with the State Bar's ability to regulate
attorneys and undermining the privilege of lawyers in this State to remain self-regulating.
12.
Defendant's conduct, if continued or tolerated by the Bar, poses potential
significant harm to future clients.
The North Carolina State Bar v. Jonathan S. McElroy
Order of Discipline

Page 8 of15

13.
The Hearing Panel has considered admonition, reprimand, and censure as
potential discipline but finds that admonition, reprimand, or censure would not be sufficient
discipline because of the gravity of the harm to clients and the threat of potential significant harm
to the public.
14.
The Panel finds that any sanction less than suspension would fail to acknowledge
the seriousness of the offenses committed by Defendant, would not adequately protect the public,
and would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar in this State.
15.
Due to Defendant's numerous violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the
public can only be adequately protected by a period of active suspension of Defendant's law
license. Defendant should be allowed the opportunity to apply for a stay of a portion of the
suspension imposed by this Order upon compliance with certain conditions designed to ensure
protection of the public and to ensure Defendant's compliance with the Rules of Professional
Conduct.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Findings and
Conclusions Regarding Discipline, and with the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel enters
the following
