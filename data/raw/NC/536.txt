______________________________________________________________________________
On October 22, 2015, the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar met and
considered the grievance filed against you by the North Carolina State Bar. The grievance was
assigned to a Subcommittee, which thoroughly reviewed the results of the State Bar staff’s
investigation of this matter.
Pursuant to section .0113(a) of the Discipline and Disability Rules of the North Carolina
State Bar, the Grievance Subcommittee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the
information available to it, including your response to the letter of notice, the Grievance
Subcommittee found probable cause. Probable cause is defined in the rules as “reasonable cause
to believe that a member of the North Carolina State Bar is guilty of misconduct justifying
disciplinary action.”
The rules provide that after a finding of probable cause, the Grievance Committee may
determine that the filing of a complaint and a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission are not required and the Grievance Committee may issue various levels of
discipline depending upon the misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any
aggravating or mitigating factors. The Grievance Committee may issue an admonition, a
reprimand, or a censure.
A censure is a written form of discipline more serious than a reprimand, issued in cases in
which an attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct and
has caused significant harm or potential significant harm to a client, the administration of justice,
the profession or a member of the public, but the misconduct does not require suspension of the
attorney's license.
The Grievance Committee believes that a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission is not required in this case and issues this censure to you. As chairman of the
Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar, it is now my duty to issue this censure.
You were administratively suspended from the practice of law in North Carolina in
September 2012. However, in or around June 2014 while still administratively suspended, you
appeared in the Scotland County courthouse on behalf of two clients and requested continuances
in their respective pending cases. Around this same time, you also accepted service of a motion
on behalf of a client in another case. By continuing to take action on your clients’ behalves
while administratively suspended from the practice of law in North Carolina, you engaged in the
unauthorized practice of law in violation of Rule 5.5(a) and engaged in conduct that was
prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d).
