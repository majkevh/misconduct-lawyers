ORDER OF DISBARMENT

TH IS MATIER was heard by the Council of the North Carolina State Bar
pursuant to 27 N.CAC. 1B §.0117 (a) of the State Bar Discipline and Disability Rules
upon the affidavit of tender of surrender of license executed by Charles Ruffin Poole on
July 11, 2011, and filed in the offices of the State Bar on July 11, 2011.
Based on the affidavit, the Council finds that Charles Ruffin pled guilty to and
was convicted of one count of Income Tax Evasion in violation of 26 U.S.C. §7201 on
April 19, 2010 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North
Carolina, and that on May 17, 2011 Poole was sentenced to serve twelve months and
one day in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and ordered to pay a $30,000.00 fine.
This conduct constitutes grounds for discipline in that Poole was convicted of a criminal
offense showing professional unfitness as defined by Rule .0103(17) of the State Bar
Discipline and Disability Rules and N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28 (b). Poole voluntarily
consented to the entry of an Interim Suspension Order by the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission on April 28, 2010 based on his guilty plea. Poole has fully satisfied the
financial aspects of the judgment entered in the criminal matter, as evidenced by a
Satisfaction of Judgment entered by the United States on June 14, 2011.
WHEREFORE, upon motion made and duly seconded, the Council enters the
following Order:
1. The tender of surrender of the license of Charles Ruffin Poole is hereby
accepted.
2. Charles Ruffin Poole hereby is DISBARRED from the practice of law in North
Carolina. The disbarment shall be effective as of April 28, 2010, when the Disciplinary
Hearing Commission entered the Interim Suspension Order.
3. Charles Ruffin Poole shall comply with the provisions of 27 NCAC 1B § .0124
of the State Bar Discipline and Disability Rules and shall surrender his license and
permanent membership card to the Secretary of the North Carolina State Bar. Poole
has previously filed the affidavit required by 27 NCAC 1B § .0124 of the State Bar
Discipline and Disability Rules in connection with the Interim Suspension Order.

4. The costs of this action are taxed against Charles Ruffin Poole.
