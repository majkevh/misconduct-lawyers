3.

cogent, and convincing evidence that Defendant, by delivering a controlled substance to
another person, committed a criminal act that reflects adversely on her honesty,

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
J.
Defendant was disciplined by Admonition in 2011 for charging and
collecting an excessive fee in violation of Rule J.5( a).
2.
The conduct for which Defendant received an Admonition in 2011
occurred well prior to the conduct alleged in this Complaint.
3.
The Hearing Panel recognizes and takes into account that it was
Defendant's stated intention to reject this Admonition and to have it included in the
Complaint in this matter so that it would not constitute prior discipline, but that because
Defendant did not reject the Admonition in writing, it became final pursuant to the Rules.
4.
During the time period in which Defendant conmlitted these violations,
Defendant was under considerable stress in her personal life and sought mental health
treatment.
5.
The testimony established that Defendant's conduct in failing to appear in
court to represent her clients and tailing to appear in court on time demonstrated a pattern
of lack of attention to the orderly administration of justice in Alanlllilce County District
Court.
6.
Ricky Moore testified that his experience with Defendllilt had a negative
impact on his opinion of attorneys.

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27
N.C.A.C. IB ยง .OI14(w)(l), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar and concludes
that the following factors that warrant suspension of Defendant's law license are present:
(C)

Circumstances ret1ecting the Defendant's lack of honesty,
trustworthiness, or integrity;

(D)

Elevation of Defendant' s own interest above that ofthe client;

(E)

Negative impact of Defendant's actions on client's or public's
perception of the profession;

(F)

Negative impact of Defendant's actions on the administration of
justice;

(0)

Impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals ofthe
representation; and

(I)

Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication.

The remaining factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง .OI14(w)(I) are not
applicable.
2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all ofthe factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. IB ยง .OI14(w)(2), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar and concludes
that that the following factor indicating that disbarment should be considered, is present:
(A) Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication.

3.
Although a factor delineated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง .OI14(w)(2) is present,
the circumstances of this case do not dictate that disbarment is necessary in order to
adequately protect the public.
The remaining factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง .Ol14(w)(2) are not
applicable.
4.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. IB ยง .OI14(w)(3), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar and concludes
that the following factors are applicable in this matter:

-8-

(A)

(F)

The remaining factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง .0114(w)(3) are not

administration of justice, and the profession, and potential significant harm to other
clients.
6.
Defendant's conduct caused harm to the legal profession by undermining
her client's trust and confidence in lawyers and the legal system.
7.
Defendant's conduct caused han11 to the administration of justice by
creating a situation in which court officials were unable to rely on her word in conducting
the business ofthe court and by causing court time and resources to be devoted to dealing
with the ramifications of her misconduct rather than the administration of justice.
8.
The IยทIearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and finds that a
censure, reprimand, or admonition would be insufficient discipline because ofthe harnl to
the administration of justice and the public caused by Defendant's conduct.
9.
The Hearing Pmlcl finds that discipline short of suspension would not
adequately protect the public mld would send the wrong message to attorneys and to the
public about conduct expected of members of the bm.
10.
Defendant should be allowed the opportunity to apply for a stay of the
balmlce of the suspension imposed by this order upon compliance with certain conditions

the Rules of Professional Conduct.
