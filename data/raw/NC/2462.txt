1, 1. After being served with the November 3, 2000 Order of Discipline
Defend~nt did not promptly deliver the property of his clients itemized in the
preceding paragraph to his clients or their substituted attorney, if any, nor did
Defendant disburse such property or funds to the appropriate parties on behalf of
hjs clients.
1:2. On or about April 3, 2001 Defendant was properly served with a
subpoena properly issued by the Seoretary of the North Carolina State Bar
requiring Defendant to produce for the six years preceding the date of the
subpoena for hiS trust account(s) and business accounts(s) all bank statements,
all original cancelled checks, all original deposit slips and items of deposit, ail
client le~ger sheets, all check registers, all other records of client receipt and
disburs~ments, including any cash receipt and disbursement journal( s),
settlement statements, and trust account reconciliations.

I"

13. Accompanying the subpoena identified above was a letter addressed
to Defendant from Reginald T. Shaw, Investigator with the State Bar, identifying a
smaller number of documents to be produced to comply with the subpoena than
described in the subpoena.

14.

Defendant did not provide to the State Bar all of the documents listed
on the sl;Jbpoena or in the letter of Reginald T. Shaw.

Defendant on or about April 11 , 2001 in which Shaw questioned Defendant about
3

I

specific client files and funds remaining in Defendant's trust account on behalf of
those clients. Defendant informed Shaw that he had agreed with some of the
clients to retain in his trust account funds earmarked for payment of medical care
providers until the stCltute of limitations prevented the mediccll care providers
from claiming the funds at which time Defendant and the client(s) would split the
funds. Defendant also told Shaw that Defendant did not send letters to any of
his client$ informing them of his suspension because he had sold his practice
before he was served with the Order of Suspension and therefore had no clients
and no obligation to inform ?lnyone of his suspension.

I

16. One of the clients for whom Defendant was holding funds was Billie
Watson. Defendant had settled a personal injury claim on Ms Watson's behalf
prior to 2001 and was holding funds in his trust account for payment of a
potential Medicare lien. In early 2001 Ms Watson was notified she had to
reimburse Medicare but she was unable to reach Defendant to obtain her funds
with which to pay the lien. As a result, Ms Watson had to borrow funds from a
bank to pay the Medicare lien.

18. Defendant did not provide the documentation as ordered by Judge

I

Fulton.

19. After the entry of Judge Fulton's Order of Disbursement of Funds
dated October 16, 2001, the State Bar learned that some of the 'information
provided by Defendant and relied upon by the State .Bar in applying to .Judge
Fulton for the Order of Disbursement, and upon which Judge Fulton relied in
issuing the Order of Disbursement, was incorrect. As a result, on or about
February 18, 2002 the State Bar moved the court to modify the October 16, 2001 .
Order of Disbursement based on accurate information the State Bar had
gathered and on or about April 9, 2002 Judge J. Gentry Caudill entered a

5

I

.

2. Defendant's foregoing actions constitute grounds for- discipline

and failed to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the '

,

I

b. by delivering confidential client files to other attorneys without
the permission of his clients, Defendant knowingly revealed confidential
information of his cli~nts in violCitipn of Rule 1.6(c);
c. by failing to promptly deliver the property of his clients itemized
in paragraph 10 to his clients or their designated attorneys, and Oy failing to
disburse such funds as appropriate on behalf of his clients, Defendant did not
promptly Payor deliver to the clients, or to third persons as directed by the

currently entitled in violation of Rule 1.15-2(m);

,~;,:

d. by failing to produce documentation pursuant to a duly served

lawful demand for'information from a disciplinary authority in violation of Rule
8.1 (b) and engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in
'violation of Rule 8.4(d); and

..

e. by failing to comply with Judge Fulton's October 16, 2Q01 Order,
and by engaging in conduct contemptuous of a judicial authority, Defendant
engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in viOlation of Rule
8.4(d).
.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the
Hearing Committee also, enters the following
FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. Defendant's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
a. A lengthy and significant prior disciplinary history. Defendant
received the following discipline:

6

I

.'

,
~

"

~,

.

.-

i. November 12, 1989, Public Reprimand for failing to
zealouply represent his client and repeatedly failing to respond to inquiries of a
disciplinary
authority;
,
'

ii. November 6, 1992, Reprimand for failing to communicate
with hi~ client and repeatedly failing to respond to inquiries,of a disciplinary
authority;
iii. December 1, 1999, six month suspension, stayed for two
years for failillg to participate in good faith in fee dispute arbitration and
repeatedly failing to respond to inquiries of a disciplinary authority; and

I'

I

iv. November 3, 2000, five year suspension, three years
active for failing to file and pay federal and state employee withholding taxes.
b. A dishonest or selfish motive;
c. A pattern of misconduct;
d. Multiple Qffenses over a period of numerous years;
e. Substantial experience in the practice of law;
f. Bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceedings by failing to
comply:with the rules or orders of the disciplinary authorities;
,
g. Submission of false statements or other deceptive practices
during the diSCiplinary process in his state,ments to Investigator Shaw and in
providin:g erroneous information to the Bar;
h. Refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct;

i. The vulnerability of at least one victim, Billie Watson, and
potentia'lly those clients that appear in paragraph 10 of the Findings of Fact
above.

I

2~ Defendant's misconduct is mitigated only by a delay in the disciplinary
process through no fault of Defendant.

3;

The aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors.

4; An order imposing discipline short of disbarment would not sufficiently
protect tre public for the following reasons:
a. Defendant's condUct significantly and actually harmed his
clients, qS shown in the record and as shown in the list of the clients in

7

I

paragraph 10 of the Findings of Fact whose money he held for some length of
time;
b. Because of Defendant's multiple offenses over a number of
years and a pattern of misconduct which is likely to continue, significant potential
harm exists to future clients;
c. The number of clients harmed or potentially harmed and the
extensive period of time over which, the harm to his clients has occurred despite
priOr sanction$ indicates that Defendant has not reformed or does not understand
that his conduct is in need of reformation in order to continue practicing law;

I

d. Defenqant's'multiple violations over a sl!bstantial period of time
caused harm to the legal profession. Defendant has been sanctioned four times
before and yet he continues to refuse to follow the rLlles of The State Bar.
Defendant's most recent misconduct culminated in a public contempt proceeding,
which is particularly egregious in light of the fact that no factual contentions
'
justified withholding the information sought; it appears he simply did not want to
comply. Defendant's conduct is a poor reflection on the reputation of the legal
professfon as a whole such that the public trust in attorneys would tend to be
eroded, if not permanently damaged.
}I,;;'.
,

I

.'

e. The evidence tended to show that Defendant colluded With
some of his clients to avoid payments to creditors, engaged in potential fraud'in
his attempt to sell his practice to avoid notifying his, clients about his impending
discipline, and attempted to retain property, i.e. client files, by false pretenses,
These activities harmed the public. In addition, Defendant poses a potential
future :risk of harm to the public should he continue to practice law and engage in
multiple violations 'of the Rules of Professional Conduct in the handling of his
clients' records as he has in the past.
f. An Order of Discipline imposing any sanction less than
disbarment would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of these offenses and
would send the wrong message to attorneys and potential clients, as well as the
public, regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar ih this state.
g. The protection of the public requires that Defendant not be
permitted to resume the practice of law until he demonstrates that he has
reformed, that he understands his obligations to his clients, and that
reinstatement would not injure the standing of the legal profession, future clients
or the public in general. Disbarred attorneys must show reformation, among ,
other things, before they resume the practice of law, whereas no such showing, is
necessary for an attorney whose license is merely suspended.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclu~ions of Law, and
Findings Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Committee enters the follOWing

8

I
