CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.
All parties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the Panel has
jurisdiction over Defendant and the subject matter of this proceeding.
2.
Defendant's conduct, as set out in the stipulated Findings of Fact above,
constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28(b)(2) as follows:
a. By delegating trust account management, bookkeeping, and reconciliation
duties to G. Seymour without providing supervision to G. Seymour of
these duties, Defendant failed to supervise a non-attorney assistant to the
extent necessary to ensure the assistant's conduct was compatible with the
professional obligations of Defendant in violation of Rule 5.3(b), failed to

Order of Discipline

Page 3 of14

ensure entrusted funds were properly maintained in violation of Rule 1.152(a), and failed to ensure her trust account was reconciled monthly and
quarterly in violation of Rule 1.15-3(d);
b. By delegating negotiation duties and client communication in personal
injury cases to J. Crumbly without providing supervision to J. Crumbly. of
these duties, Defendant failed to supervise a non-attorney assistant to the
extent necessary to ensure the assistant's conduct was compatible with the
professional obligations of Defendant in violation of Rule 5.3(b), failed to
ensure cases were settled only after the required consultation with and
consent ofthe client in violation of Rule 1.2(a), failed to ensure her clients

non-attorney in the unauthorized practice of law in violation of Rule
5.5(f), and placed entrusted funds at risk in violation of Rule 1.15-2(a).
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and with the
consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence
the following
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE

I.
Defendant trusted her mother, G. Seymour, without reservation to
maintain the accounting for her firm. Up until about August 2015, when Defendant
noticed a decline in G. Seymour's mental acuity, Defendant placed great confidence and
trust in her mother's ability to handle the accounting. Defendant is now aware that her
mother had been diagnosed with a brain lesion but was not aware of that diagnosis until
the fall of2015.
2.
Defendant trusted her brother, J. Crumbly, to serve as a case manager in
her firm. Defendant placed significant trust in her brother in this position.
3.
Defendant believes J. Crumbly betrayed the bust Defendant had placed in
him, and G. Seymour was either unaware of J. Crumbly'S actions due to mental decline
or attempted to shield Defendant from his actions and protect her son.
4.
Defendant acknowledges that J. Crumbly was able to embezzle client
funds because she failed to provide supervision and oversight of her employees and her
trust account.
5.
Defendant acknowledges it was her sole responsibility to ensure all
entrusted funds were held, maintained, and disbursed only in accordance with the Rules
of Professional Conduct.

The North Carolina State Bar v. Stephanie L. Viliaver
Order ofDiscipline

Page 4 of 14

6.
After the State Bar contacted her in September 2015 about her trust
account, Defendant arranged for an accountant to review her records. When the
accountant's preliminary review began to uncover J. Crumbly's misappropriation,
Defendant promptly terminated J. Crumbly's employment, locked him out of the office,
and changed the locks. She also terminated his authorization to access the firm's
computers and worked to ensure he could not gain unauthorized access to the computers.
Defendant also reported J. Crumbly's conduct to the Onslow County District Attorney.
7.
Defendant has been notifying clients whose funds were found to have not
been properly maintained in or disbursed from her trust account.

8.
Defendant has coordinated with clients and her liability carrier. Her
liability carrier is honoring claims from her clients and has been making payments to her
clients and their medical providers, as applicable, to reimburse the clients for the funds
not properly maintained or disbursed on their behalf from Defendant's trust account.

9.

Defendant fully cooperated with the State Bar's investigation.

10.
Defendant has prior discipline. Defendant was reprimanded by the
Grievance Committee in 2014 for advertising issues and for inaccuracies in her responses
to the State Bar raising concerns of intentional misleading or reckless disregard for the
truth of her responses

11.
There is no evidence of any dishonest or selfish motive on the part of
Defendant in this case.
12.
Defendant experienced personal problems during the time period at issue
in this matter which distracted Defendant from engaging in the necessary and appropriate
supervision and review of her trust account, her cases, and her employees, including the
following: complicated birth of a child in 2011; two surgeries in May - August 2013 with
significant time out of the office; deployment of her husband on multiple occasions with
concomitant increased child care responsibilities; critical injuries suffered by her other
brother such that his children lived with Defendant from November 2011 to 2013.
13.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fOlms of
discipline available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and
disbarment, in considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
14.
The Hearing Panel finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence any
additional facts that may be contained in the conclusions regarding discipline set out
below.
Based on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, and with the consent of the parties, the Hearing
Panel makes the following

Page 50f14

CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearing Panel has considered all ofthe factors enumerated in 27 N.C.
Admin. Code § IB. 0Il4(w)(l) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factor warrants suspension of Defendant's license:
a. Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential hatm is
foreseeable, to wit: failing to supervise those to whom she entrusted trust
account access and client information and failing to monitor her trust
account and her clients' cases, creating circumstances under which her
brother could hold himself out as an attorney and could misappropriate
entrusted funds;
b. Potential negative impact of Defendant's actions on clients' or the public's
perception of the profession; and
c. Potential impairment of her clients' ability to achieve goals of her
representation, to wit: compensation and payment of medical expenses
arising from personal injuries.
2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.
Admin. Code § lB.0114(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes no factors are present in this instance that would warrant disbarment.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.
Admin. Code § lB.0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
a. Prior disciplinary offense, to wit: reprimand in 2014 for advertising issues
and inaccuracies in her responses to the State Bar raising concerns of
intentional misleading or reckless disregard for the truth of her responses;
b. Absence of dishonest or selfish motive;
c. Timely good faith efforts to rectify the consequences of the rule
violations;
d. Full and free disclosure to the Hearing Panel and cooperative attitude
toward the proceedings;
e. Multiple offenses;
f.

Effect of personal problems on the conduct in question;

g. Defendant has practiced law for 13 years.

The North Carolina Stale Bar v. Stephanie L. Villaver
Order afDiscipline

Page 6 of14

4.
Defendant's failure to properly maintain, manage, and handle entrusted
funds betrays a vital trust clients and the public place in attorneys and the legal
profession.
5.
The Hearing Panel has considered issuing an admonition, reprimand or
censure but concludes that such discipline would not be sufficient discipline because of
tbe gravity of the potential harm to the clients. The Panel further concludes that such
discipline would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the violations committed by
Defendant and send the wrong message to attorneys regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar in this State.

6.
This Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and concludes that a
stayed suspension with conditions is necessary and sufficient to adequately protect the
public.
7.
For these reasons, this Hearing Panel finds that an ordel' imposing
discipline shOtt of a stayed suspension of Defendant's law license would not be
appropriate.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and the
Findings of Fact and Conclusions regarding discipline, and based upon the consent of the
parties, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
