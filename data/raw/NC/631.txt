Plaintiff
ORDER
OF DISCIPLINE

v.
LORI M. GLENN, Attorney,
Defendant

THIS MATTER was heard on August 22, 2014 before a Hearing Panel of the
Disciplinary Hearing Commission composed of Ronald R. Davis, Chair, and members
Beverly T. Beal and Randy A. Moreau, pursuant to North Carolina Administrative Code,
Title 27, Chapter I, Subchapter B, ยง .0 114(h). Plaintiff was represented by Jennifer A.
Porter. Defendant Lori M. Glenn ("Glenn") appeared pro se.
Based upon the pleadings in this matter, the Hearing Panel previously granted
Plaintiffs Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and entered findings of fact and
conclusions of law based upon the pleadings. Those findings of fact and conclusions of
law are repeated herein.
Based upon the pleadings and Defendant's admissions, the Hearing Panel finds by
clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following:
Findings of Fact
1.
Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar ("State Bar"), is a body duly
organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this
proceeding under the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North
Carolina, and the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar (Chapter I of
Title 27 of the North Carolina Administrative Code).
2.
Defendant, Lori M. Glenn ("Glenn"), was admitted to the North Carolina
State Bar in 1988 and is, and was at all times referred to herein, an attorney at law
licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the laws of the State of North Carolina,
the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and the Rules of Professional
Conduct.
3.
Defendant was properly served with process and the matter carne before
the Hearing Panel with due notice to all parties.
Page 1 of 11

4.
During all or part of the relevant periods referred to herein, Glenn was
engaged in the practice of law in the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office
in Raleigh, Wake County, North Carolina.

5.
Glenn was the closing attorney in various residential real estate closings
from 2009 through 2012. In these closings she represented the buyer and the lender. In
at least thirty of these closings, Glenn failed to timely disburse the title insurance
premium shown on the HUD-I Settlement Statement and failed to submit the fmal title
opinion to obtain the title insurance policy for the owner and/or lender. Glenn failed to
respond to inquiries from at least one lender concerning an outstanding policy.
6.
Additionally, in several of these closings Glenn failed to make other
disbursements shown on the applicable HUD-I Settlement Statements.
7.
In certain closings, including those involving clients P.A., H.A., L.B.,
C.c., T.D., N.H., T.H., R.K., D.L., J.M., L.T., N.V., and T.Y., Glenn's deposits and
disbursements did not match the receipt of funds and disbursements shown on the HUD-I
Settlement Statements.

8.
In certain closings, including those involving clients R.K., PR., L.B.,
T.D., J.M., and N.V., Glenn failed to collect sufficient funds at closing to make all of the
disbursements shown on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement for the closing or that she
actually made for the closing. In the closings involving clients R.K. and P.R., this
resulted in Glenn disbursing more from her trust account for the closings than she had
collected for the closings. In the closings involving L.B., T.D., 1M., and N.V, this
resulted in Glenn not having sufficient funds to complete disbursements for the closings.
9.
Glenn maintained an attorney trust account from 2009 through 2012.
Glenn failed to conduct quarterly reconciliations of her trust account from at least
January 1,2010 through November 1,2012.

In November 2012, Glenn consented to an injunction which prohibited her
10.
from handling entrusted funds. Glenn arranged for another attorney to handle entrusted
funds for her real estate clients, who submitted the title opinions to the title insurance
company and handled all entrusted funds for closings for Glenn's clients after the entry of
the injunction.

II.
In about June 2013, Glenn was notified of title issues that needed to be
resolved in three closings in order for the title insurance company to issue title policies.
Glenn failed to timely address the issues and no title policies had been issued as of
January 2014.

Based upon the foregoing findings offact, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
Conclusions of Law
1.
All parties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the Panel has
jurisdiction over Defendant and the subj ect matter of this proceeding.
2.
Defendant's conduct, as set out in the stipulated Findings of Fact above,
constitutes grouuds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(2) as follows:
(a)

By failing to timely complete fmal title opinions and disburse title
insurance premiums to obtain title policies for owners andlor lenders, by
failing to complete disbursements to other third parties in certain closings,
and by failing to address title issues raised by the title insurance company,
Glenn failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in
representing a client in violation of Rule 1.3 and failed to promptly
disburse client funds in violation of Rule I.IS-2(m);

(b)

By failing to respond to inquiries from a lender regarding an overdue title
policy, Glenn failed to promptly comply with reasonable requests for
information in violation of Rule 1.4(a)(4) and failed to keep a client
reasonably informed about the statns of the matter in violation of Rule
1.4(a)(3);

(c)

By failing to conduct quarterly reconciliations of her trust accouuts, Glenn
failed to conduct requisite reconciliations in violation of Rule 1.153(d)(l); and

(d)

By failing to collect and disburse funds in accordance with the HUD-I
Settlement Statements and by disbursing more for clients than she had
deposited for those clients in the trust accouut, Glenn failed to properly
maintain and disburse entrusted funds in violation of Rule I.1S-2(a), (j)
and (m).

Based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, the Hearing Panel finds by
clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following:
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline
1.

Glenn was not tracking matters to ensure completion of all items.

2.
Glenn felt overwhelmed when contacted by a lender about an outstanding
policy and did not retrieve the file for the matter or respond to the lender.
3.
Glenn did not realize how many title policies were outstanding from her
closings uutil she participated in the investigation and audit by the State Bar.
4.
Glenn has had a balance in her trust accouut in excess of $300,000.00 for
several years but carmot identifY all funds in her trust accouut.
Page 3 of 11

5.
Conducting quarterly reconciliations of the trust account is the lynchpin of
proper maintenance and protection of entrusted funds.
6.
Had Glenn been conducting quarterly reconciliations, she would have seen
balances remaining for various clients which would have signaled that work, such as
obtaining the title policy, still needed to be done in the file.
7.
Had Glenn been conducting quarterly reconciliations, she would have had
to identify the funds in her trust account and would have maintained awareness of whose
funds were in her trust account and the appropriate disbursement of those funds.
8.
The lenders in the residential real estate transactions closed by Glenn were
vulnerable clients in that it was solely through Glenn that the title insurance pl'emiunl
from the loan proceeds held by Glenn in her trust account could be disbursed to the title
insurance company and the title policy obtained.
9.
The title insurance companies are third parties affected by Glenn's failure
to timely disburse title insurance premiums and complete final title opinions. GleIm's
failure to pay the premium and provide the necessary final title opinion impedes the title
insurance company's ability to issue title policies.
10.
Glenn received a censure in 2009 for her handling of a real estate matter,
including her failure to obtain the title policy in a timely manner.
11.

Glenn was cooperative with the State Bar in its investigation.

12.

There is no evidence of any dishonest or selfish motive on the part of

Glenn.
13.
While the State Bar's investigation was pending, Glenn consented to an
i1\iunction which prohibited her from handling entrusted funds. Glenn arranged for
another attorney to handle entrusted funds for her real estate clients, who submitted the
title opinions to the title insurance company and handled all entrusted funds for closings
for Glenn's clients after the entry of the injunction. Despite this association with another
attorney on her closings, however, Glenn continued to neglect title issues in certain
closings, resulting in delay of the issuance oftitle insurance policies.
14.
Glenn continues to experience personal life difficulties to which she
attributes her prior and ongoing failures to diligently complete all tasks in real estate
closings.

IS.
Glenn has expressed remorse and has made efforts to rectify the
consequences of her conduct, including by drafting the final title opinions for the
majority of the files for which policies are due.
16.
Glenn has cured all deficits in her trust account identified by the State Bar
caused by discrepancies between actual deposits and disbursements and those shown on
the HUD-I Settlement Statement.

17.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and
disbarment, in considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
Based on the findings of fact and conclusions oflaw above and the additional
findings offact regarding discipline, the Hearing Panel makes the following:
Conclusions With Respect To Discipline

1.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง .0114(w)(I) of the Rilles and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and concludes the following factors warrant suspension of
Defendant's license:
a.
Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential
harm is foreseeable, to wit: failing to conduct quarterly reconciliations and thus
failing to maintain awareness of whose funds were in her trust account and failing
to recognize work remained to be done and premiums remained to be disbursed
from closings;
b.
Negative impact of Defendant's actions on client's or public's
perception of the profession;
c.
Impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the
representation, to wit: timely procurement of title insurance policies; and
d.

Effect of Defendant's conduct on third parties.

2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27N.C.A.C. 1B ยง .0114(w)(2) of the Rules and Regillations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes no factors are present in this instance that woilld warrant disbarment.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง .0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
a.

Prior discipline;

b.

Absence of a dishonest or selfish motive;

c.
Timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify
consequences of the misconduct;
d.

A pattern of misconduct;

e.

Multiple offenses;
Page 5 of 11

f.

Effect of personal problems on Defendant's diligence;

g.
Full and free disclosure to the Hearing Panel and cooperative
attitude toward the proceedings;
h.

Remorse;

i.

Vulnerability of Defendant's clients; and

J.

Defendant's substantial experience in the practice oflaw.

4.
Defendant's conduct caused significant hann to her buyer and lender
clients, whose funds were not properly maintained and disbursed and who did not receive
the desired product of the intended disbursements (e.g. title policies).
5.
Defendant's conduct caused potential significant harm to both her clients
and to the title insurance companies. The absence of title policies could have been, or
could be in the future, significantly hannful to the clients and the title insurance company
if a title issue arose or arises before being remedied.
6.
Defendant's failure to reconcile her trust account over the years has
caused significant hann to clients, contributing to her inability to identify all client funds
in her account and to determine and make appropriate disbursement of those funds.
7.
Defendant's conduct, if continued or tolerated by the Bar, poses
significant potential harm to future clients.
8.
The Hearing Panel has considered issuing an admonition, reprimand or
censure but concludes that such discipline would not be sufficient discipline because of
the gravity of the harm and potential harm to the clients. The Panel further concludes
that such discipline would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses committed
by Defendant and send the wrong message to attorneys regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar in this State.
9.
This Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and concludes that a
suspension with the possibility for the suspension to be stayed upon compliance with
certain conditions is necessary to ensure Defendant complies with necessary conditions to
avoid significant harm or the potential for significant harm to clients.
10.
For these reasons, this Hearing Panel finds that an order imposing
discipline short of a suspension of Defendant's law license would not be appropriate.
