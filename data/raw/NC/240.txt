AFFIDAVIT

*******************************

The undersigned,
follows:

being first

duly sworn,

hereby states as

I, James H. Toms, hereby tender my license to practice and
desire to resign from the North Carolina State Bar. My resignation
is tendered freely and voluntarily, is not the result of coercion
or duress, and I am fully aware of the implications of SUbmitting
the resignation.
I am aware that there is presently an investigation regarding
allegations that I have been guilty of misconduct, to wit:
(1)
Since 1989, respondent has served as attorney in fact for John
Howard Smith, now deceased.
Respondent paid from Mr. Smith's
account at First Union National Bank ("FUNB"), 6075517934, expenses
for his care, until Mr. Smith's death in 1994, but in addition
embezzled funds of at least $100,000.00 belonging to Mr. Smith from
that account; (2)
Subsequent to Mr. Smith's death, respondent
embezzled the proceeds of the sale of Mr. Smith's land in the
approximate sum of $280,000.00 from respondent's trust account at
FUNB, 7078443967; (3)
Further embezzlements occurred of Smith
property in note proceeds and various certificates of deposit, in
amounts not yet determined; and (4) Respondent has in recent years
served either as executor or attorney in fact for other estates for
clients, in which he has embezzled funds in excess of $150,000.00.
I acknowledge that the material facts upon which the
complaints are predicated are true. I am submitting my resignation
because I know that if charges were predicated upon the misconduct
under investigation, I could not successfully defend against them.
