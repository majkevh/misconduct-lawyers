Brown was served with a Summons and the Complaint filed herein and with notice
of the time and place of the hearing of this matter. All parties are properly before the hearing
panel of the Disciplinary Hearing Commission and the hearing panel has jurisdiction over Brown
and the subject matter.
2. Brown's conduct, as set out above, constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to
N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28(a) & (b)(2) in that Brown violated the Rules of Professional Conduct in
effect at the time as follows:
a. By failing to respond to each of the State Bar's written notices of the fee

services for which Godwin, Jr. and Carr paid the fees, Brown collected clearly
excessive fees in violation of Rule 1.5(a);

1.15(2)(g);

10

g. by attempting to prevent Crumpler from speaking to the State Bar investigator,
Brown engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in
violation of Rule 8.4(d);
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and the evidence
presented at the hearing, the Hearing Panel hereby makes by clear, cogent and convincing
evidence the following:
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I. On February 26, 2008, the Chair of the Grievance Committee reprimanded Brown for,
among other things, failing to promptly respond to a grievance filed by his client. In
that reprimand, Brown was warned: "in order for the disciplinary system to work,
lawyers must cooperate by responding promptly to grievances that are filed against
them."
2. On August 26, 2010, Brown was again reprimanded by a different Chair of the
Grievance Committee for, among other things, failing to respond to a client's fee
dispute and failing to promptly respond to the State Bar's requests for information in
two clients' matters.
3. In an order filed on July 19,2010 in 09 DHC 33, a hearing panel of the Disciplinary
Hearing Commission suspended Brown's license for three years, but stayed the
suspension on certain conditions, for inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature with
three female clients.
4. In an order filed on March 23, 2011 in 09 DHC 33, the same hearing panel activated
at least six months of Brown's suspension for failing to comply with certain ofthe
conditions of the stay, including failing to respond promptly to the State Bar's
requests for information during grievance investigations.
5. Brown has not sought reinstatement from the suspension imposed in 09 DHC 33.
6. Brown's continued failure to respond promptly to fee disputes and letters of notice
and follow-up inquiries in grievance investigations has demonstrated a complete
disregard for the legal profession's self-regulation process.
7. Brown's failure to file a custody action on Godwin, Jr. ' s behalf, a civil action on
Carr's behalf, and an adoption or termination of parental rights action on behalf of
either of the Greens, after being paid to do so, caused significant harm to Godwin, Jr.,
Carr and the Greens and compromised their ability to accomplish the goals of the
representation.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Additional Findings of
Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
11

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I. The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B §
.OI14(w)(1), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar, and concludes that the
following factors that warrant suspension or disbarment are present:
a. intent of Brown to commit acts where the harm or potential harm is
foreseeable;
b. elevation of Brown's own interest above that of the client;
c. negative impact of Brown's actions on his clients' and the public's perception
of the profession;
d. impairment of Brown's clients' ability to achieve the goals of the
representation; and
e. multiple instances offailure to participate in the legal profession's selfregulation process.
2. The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B §
.OI14(w)(2), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar, and concludes no factors that
warrant disbarment are present.
3. The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B §
.OI14(w)(3), the Rules and Regulations ofthe State Bar, and concludes that the
following are applicable in this matter:
a. prior disciplinary offenses;
b. a selfish motive;
c. indifference to making restitution;
d. a pattern of misconduct;
e. multiple offenses;
f.

having almost 18 years of experience in the practice of law when the
misconduct found herein began.

4. Brown caused significant harm to Godwin, Jr., Carr and the Greens for failing to
perform the legal services for which they paid him and caused significant harm to his

12

clients listed herein when he failed to participate in getting disputes resolved
concerning whether he had earned the fees that they had paid him.
5. Brown caused significant harm to the legal profession and particularly to the legal
profession's self-regulation process.
6. The Hearing Panel has considered all lesser sanctions including: censure, reprimand
and admonition, and finds that discipline less than suspension would not adequately
protect the public from future misconduct by Brown for the following reasons:
a. the protection of the public requires that Brown not be permitted to return to
the practice of law until he can demonstrate that he has the physical and
mental capacity and the determination to place the interest of his clients above
his own;
b. the protection of the public and the legal profession requires that Brown not be
permitted to return to the practice of law until he can demonstrate respect for
the legal profession's self-regulation process that will ensure prompt
compliance with future requests for information from the State Bar; and
c. entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to acknowledge
the seriousness of the offenses Brown committed and would send the wrong
message to lawyers and the public regarding the conduct expected of members
of the Bar of this State;
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Additional Findings of
Fact Regarding Discipline and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel
hereby enters the following:
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1. Defendant, William E. Brown, is hereby suspended from the practice of law in North
Carolina for a period of three years.
