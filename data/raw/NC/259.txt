AFFIDAVIT
TO:

The Council of the North Carolina State Bar

I, John Frank Harris, hereby tender my license to practice and desire to resign from the North Carolina
State Bar. My resignation is extended freely and voluntarily, and is not the result of coercion or duress, and I
am fully aware of the implications of submitting this, my resignation.
I am aware that there is presently pending an investigation or other proceedings regarding allegations
that I have been guilty of misconduct, specifically that:
I.	 I misappropriated $30,042.29 of funds from my client trust account to purchase a personal residence
in October i 994.
2.	 I misappropriated an additional $32,400 by disbursing seven separate checks from my client trust
account to my general account between February and December 1996.
3.	 In February 1997, $24,100 of client funds was deposited into my general account. I became aware
that client funds were deposited into my general account, did not transfer the funds to my trust
account and ultimately misappropriated them for my own personal use.
4.	 From 1994 through 1998, I incurred bank charges for return checks and other service charges in my
client trust account. I did not reimburse the account for these charges. The total amount of client
funds I misappropriated to pay bank charges during these five years was $6,244.75.
5.	 On November 25, 1997, one of my staff erroneously deposited $3,406.62 of client funds into my
general account. Those funds subsequently were used for my own personal purposes.
6.	 Additionally, between 1994 and 1998, an additional $160,607.11 of client funds were
unintentionally appropriated to pay other clients and third parties as a result of erroneous
disbursements of funds, a failure to deposit funds into a trust account, and a failure to collect all
necessary fi.mds for a real estate closing either by myself or other employees in my office.
7.	 After the State Bar began an investigation involving my misappropriation of client funds, I had
discussions with the State Bar, provided all information requested, conducted my own audit of my
trust account, have attempted to repay all clients for funds that were misappropriated by me and
otherwise fully cooperated in the investigation.
8.	 I failed to pay my State Bar dues for 1996, 1997 and 1998, as required by State Bar Rules.
9.	 As a result of my failure to pay my 1996 dues, the Council of the State Bar suspended my license to
practice law by Order dated October 18, 1996.
10. The Order of suspension was formally and properly served on me on May 19, 1997 by certified mail
return receipt requested.

11. After receiving formal notice of the Order of Suspension on May 19, 1997, I continued to practice
law until the State Bar obtained a temporary restraining order against me on July 8, 1998. From
May 19, 1997 until July 8, 1998, I closed at least 900 real estate transactions and represented clients
in approximately ten civil actions, some of which required me to appear in civil court.
I acknowledge that the facts as set forth in paragraphs 1-11 are true. I am submitting my resignation
because I know if charges were predicated upon the misconduct under investigation, I could not successfully

defend against them.
