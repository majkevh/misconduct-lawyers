Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and the evidence
presented at hearing, the Hearing Panel hereby finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence
the following:
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
Defendant's failure to properly maintain, manage and handle entrusted funds
betrays a vital trust that clients and the public place in attorneys and the legal profession.
2.
Conduct.

Defendant's conduct resulted in numerous violations of the Rules of Professional

3.
Defendant's conduct includes numerous instances of failing to timely respond in
writing to notices from the FDRP and to timely respond to letters of notice sent to Defendant by
the State Bar.
4.
Defendant, who was licensed to practice law in North Carolina in 1986, has
substantial experience in the practice of law.
5.
Defendant's neglect of client cases caused failure to appear notices, DMV
suspension letters, and failure to comply notices to be issued. Defendant's conduct exposed
several clients to significant legal consequences. One client was actually arrested due to
Defendant's failure to get his case continued. Client cases were not timely processed and clients'
requests for information about their cases went ignored. The actual alTest of one client, and the
prospect for arrest of other clients who had failure to appear notices entered, and the potential
suspension of driving privileges due to Defendant's neglect, resulted in significant harm and
potential significant harm to clients.
6.
Defendant's neglect impacted the orderly process of cases through the courts and
caused court officials to have to enter failure to appear notices, failure to comply notices, and
resulted in one client actually being subj ect to the arrest process. Court official frequently had to
recall orders for arrest that had been issued against Defendant's clients.

18

7.
Clients who hired Defendant reasonably relied upon him to timely process their
cases through the courts. In many instances, however, clients, some of whom lived out-of-state
or significant distances ftom where their cases were pending, had to resolve their cases pro se or
had to pay the monetary part of judgments where funds to cover costs and fines had been paid to
Defendant.
8.
Defendant's misconduct had a negative impact on his clients' perception of the
legal profession. Client cases were not processed timely, phone calls and email messages were
not returned, court dates were missed and when clients contacted the FDRP for assistance they
were further frustrated by Defendant's habitual failure to participate in that process. FDRP
petitions became grievance cases.
9.
The multiple instances offailing to reasonably communicate with his clients,
Defendant's failure to timely follow-up on commitments he made to clients, and
misrepresentations contained in some of Defendant's responses to the State Bar demonstrate a
lack of trustworthiness on the part of Defendant.
10.
In or about 2012 through 2013, Defendant changed his business model to an
internet based practice handling mostly traffic and uncontested domestic cases. Where
Defendant previously had two employees to help manage his practice, in his new business model
he ran the business without any support staff. During this transition, Defendant continued to
accept a high volume of cases when it was obvious to him he did not have the software programs
and systems in place which were necessary to handle the volume of cases he was accepting.
11.
Defendant had open heart surgery in 2011, believes he has suffered at times from
a compromised memory, and was attending to serious family issues during some or all of the
period covered by this conduct.
12.

Defendant enjoys a good reputation as an attorney in Buncombe County.

13.
Defendant's prior discipline includes: 97G0029(IV)R - Admonition in 1997 for
neglect in preparing a court order; 03G0284 - Admonition in 2003 for failure to deposit entrusted
funds in a trust account and failure to respond to a letter of notice; 06G0672 and 0600908 Reprimand in 2006 for neglect, failure to keep his clients reasonably informed about their cases,
and failure to respond to letters of notice; 1300123 - Reprimand in 2013 for neglect, failure to
communicate with client, and failure to participate in the FDRP; 1300122 - Censure in 2013 for
neglect, failure to communicate with client, failure to participate in FDRP, and failure to timely
respond to a letter of notice.
14.
Defendant's conduct in this proceeding and his prior discipline is remarkable for
chronic neglect of client's cases and Defendant's repeated refusal to participate in the selfregulatory processes of the profession.
15.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of discipline
available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and disbarment, in
considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
19

Based on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the additional Findings
of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fonns of discipline
available to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. IB § .0114(w)(1) ofthe Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and
concludes the following factors are present:
a. Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential hann is
foreseeable;
b. Circumstances reflecting Defendant's lack of honesty and trustworthiness;
c. Elevation of the Defendant's own interest above that of his client;
d. Negative impact of Defendant's actions on client's or public's perception of the
profession;
e. Negative impact of the Defendant's actions on the administration of justice;

f. Impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the representation.
g. Acts of misrepresentation; and
h. Multiple instances offailure to pm1icipate in the legal profession's self-regulation
process.
2.
The Hearing Panel has considered aU ofthe factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
IB § .0114(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and concludes the
following factor is present:
a. Acts of dishonesty or misrepresentation.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
1B § .0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and concludes the
following factors are applicable in this matter:
a. Prior disciplinary offenses in this State;
b. Dishonest or selfish motive;
c. Indifference to making restitution;

20

d. A pattern of misconduct;
e. Multiple offenses;
f.

Effect of personal or emotional problems on the conduct in question;

g. Effect of physical or mental disability or impairment on the conduct in question;
h. Defendant's cooperative attitude toward the proceedings;

i. Bad faith obstruction ofthe disciplinary proceedings by intentionally failing to
comply with rules of the disciplinary agency;
J.

Defendant's good general character and reputation;

k. Defendant's experience in the practice of law; and
1. Vulnerabili ty of victims,
4.
The Hearing Panel has considered issuing an admonition, reprimand or censure
but concludes that such discipline would not be sufficient discipline. The Panel concludes that
such discipline would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the violations committed by
Defendant and send the wrong message to attomeys and the public regarding the conduct
expected of members of the Bar in this State.
5.
The Hearing Panel considered disbarment but concludes that considering all the
circumstances of this case disbanuent is not necessary to protect the public or the profession in
this matter.
6.
The Hearing Panel has considered all altematives and concludes that a suspension
is necessary to adequately protect the pUblic. The Hearing Panel finds that an order imposing
discipline short of suspension would not be appropriate.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and the Findings of
Fact and Conclusions regarding discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
