OF DISCIPLINE BY CONSENT

)
)
)

This matter was considered by a hearing panel of the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission duly appointed and composed of the Chair, Sharon B. Alexander, and
panel members Donna Rascoe and Charles L. Garrett. Katherine E. Jean represented
Plaintiff. Defendant appeared pro se. Both stipulate and agree to the findings of fact
and conclusions of law recited in this consent order and to the discipline imposed.
Defendant knowingly, freely and voluntarily consents to the order of discipline, waives a
formal hearing in this case, waives his right to appeal this consent order or challenge in
any way the sufficiency of the findings, the conclusions of law or the discipline imposed.
Based upon the stipulations of fact and the consent of the parties, the hearing panel
enters the following:

FINDINGS OF FACT
1.
Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar ("State Bar"), is a body duly organized
under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this proceeding under
the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, and the
Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar (Chapter 1 of Title 27 of the
North Carolina Administrative Code).
2.
Defendant, Ronald L. Pressley ("Pressley" or "Defendanf'), was admitted to the
North Carolina State Bar in 1996, and is, and was at all times referred to herein, an
attorney at law licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the laws of the State of
North Carolina, the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and the
Rules of Professional Conduct.
3.
During part of the relevant periods referred to herein, Pressley was engaged in
the practice of law in the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office in Raleigh,
Wake County, North Carolina.

4.
During part of the relevant periods referred to herein, Pressley was
administratively suspended from the practice of law in the State of North Carolina
pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-16 and 27 N.CAC. 10 ยง .0903 for failing to comply
with Continuing Legal Education requirements for the year 2005.
5.
In 2004, Pressley agreed to represent Dr. Ray Legen and Mrs. Susan Legen
("the Legens") in two personal injury cases related to two separate automobile accidents
which occurred in April 2004.
6.
Pressley filed a complaint on behalf of Dr. Legen on March 22, 2007, but failed to
provide a copy of the complaint to Dr. Legen or otherwise notify Dr. Legen that the
complaint had been filed. Pressley also filed a complaint on behalf of Mrs. Legen on
March 22, 2007 but failed to provide a copy of the complaint to Mrs. Legen or otherwise
inform Mrs. Legen that the complaint had been filed.
7.
On March 22, 2007, when he filed the complaints on behalf of the Legens,
Pressley's law license was administratively suspended.
8.
Throughout the representation, Pressley failed to return phone calls and email
messages from the Legens inquiring about the status of their cases. Because Pressley
did not respond to their inquiries, the Legens did not know whether he had filed the
cornplaints and were concerned about the possibility that their claims would be barred
by the statute of limitations.
9.
After he filed Dr. Legen's complaint on March 22, 2007, Pressley served the
complaint and summons on one of the two named defendants. The summons for the
second defendant was not served, and was returned to Pressley marked "address
unknown."
10.
From May 2007 through May 2008, Pressley had six alias and pluries ("A & P")
summonses issued in Dr. Legen's case. Each of the A & P summonses listed the same
incorrect address for the second defendant, who was never served with the complaint.
11.
Aside from issuing these A & P summonses bearing an incorrect address,
Pressley failed to take any further action in Dr. Legen's case.
12.
In 2008, Pressley agreed to settle Mrs. Legen's case for $2,000.00. He did not
consult with, or obtain authorization from, Mrs. Legen prior to accepting this settlement.
13.
Pursuant to the settlement agreement, on May 29, 2008, State Farm Insurance
issued a check for $2,000.00, payable to Mrs. Legen and Pressley's law firm.
14.
Pressley received the $2,000.00 settlement check from State Farm, but did not
notify Mrs. Legen that he had received settlement funds on her behalf.
15.
Pressley did not deposit the check from State Farm into his firm's trust account or
any other bank account, nor did he deliver the settlement proceeds to Mrs. Legen. The
check from State Farm remained, un-negotiated, in Mrs. Legen's client file.

-2-

16.
Pressley did not file a voluntary dismissal of Mrs. Legen's case, as required by
the settlement agreement with State Farm.
In June 2008, Pressley left his law firm, taking all of his clients' files with him. He
17.
did not notify all of his clients of his separation from the firm.
18.
Pressley did not notify his clients that-upon his separation from the firm-they
could continue to be represented by Pressley, continue to be represented by the firm, or
hire another lawyer.
19.
In July 2008, the Legens called Pressley's former law firm and were told that
Pressley no longer worked there. The firm provided the Legens with a phone number
for Pressley, which they called repeatedly, seeking information about the status of their
cases. Pressley failed to return the Legens' phone calls.
20.
Pressley's former law partner informed the Legens that they could choose to
remain as clients of the firm, in which case another attorney would assume
responsibility for their representation.
21.
The Legens decided that they did not want Pressley to continue to represent
them, and that they wanted Pressley's former firm to represent them instead.
22.
On September 18, 2008, Pressley's former partner sent Pressley an email
informing him of the Legens' request for the firm to take over their cases. In that email,
she directed Pressley to return the Legens' files to her.
23.
On September 23, 2008, Dr. Legen sent Pressley an email instructing Pressley
to provide the Legens' files to Pressley's former partner.
24.
Issues related to Pressley's departure from his former law firm were arbitrated in
the fall of 2008. Among other things, the arbitration order required Pressley to return
client files to the firm.
25.
Despite specific requests from the Legens and his former partner, and an
arbitration order directing him to return client files to the firm, Pressley failed to return
the Legens' files to his forrner firm.
26.
On December 9, 2008, the Legens filed a grievance against Pressley with the
State Bar. This grievance was assigned file number 08G1502.
27.
On or about January 6, 2009, the State Bar issued a letter of notice to Pressley
advising him that a grievance had been filed against hirn. Pressley received the letter of
notice regarding file number 08G1502 by certified mail on January 13, 2009.
28.
Pressley was required to respond within fifteen days of receipt of the letter of
notice. He failed to respond within that time period.

-3-

29.
On or about February 24, 2009. the State Bar sent Pressley a follow-up letter that
noted his failure to respond to the letter of notice and reminded him of his obligation to
respond.
30.
On or about March 6. 2009. the State Bar sent Pressley another follow-up letter
that noted his failure to respond to the letter of notice. Pressley was required to
respond to the follow-up letter by March 16, 2009. Pressley failed to respond by that
deadline.
31.
The State Bar received Pressley's response to the letter of notice on March 18.
2009. The response was incomplete.
32.
On or about March 24. 2009, the State Bar sent Pressley a letter advising
Pressley that his response failed to address several of the allegations set forth in the
letter of notice. Pressley was required to provide the additional information requested in
this letter by April 14. 2009. Pressley failed to respond by that deadline.
33.
On May 18, 2009. the State Bar issued a subpoena commanding Pressley to
appear at the State Bar office for an interview. Pressley was personally served with the
subpoena on May 19. 2009.
34.
On June 1, 2009, Pressley appeared at the State Bar office pursuant to the
subpoena to discuss grievance file number 08G1502. He did not, however. provide a
written response to the State Bar's March 24. 2009 letter.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the hearing panel hereby
enters the following:

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the hearing
panel enters the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of discipline
available to it.
2.
The hearing panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
1B ยง.0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and finds
the following factors are applicable in this matter:

-5-

(a)

The lack of prior disciplinary offenses by Defendant;

(b)

The absence of a dishonest or selfish motive by Defendant;

(c)

The effect of Defendant's personal and emotional problems on the
conduct in question;

(d)

Defendant's interim rehabilitation through voluntary participation in the
LAP program the North Carolina State Bar; and

(e)

Defendant's substantial experience in the practice of law.

3.
The hearing panel has also considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. 1B ยง.0114(w)(1) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar
and finds the following factors warrant suspension of Defendant's license:
(a)

The negative impact of Defendant's actions on the client's and the public's
perception of the profession;

(b)

The negative impact of Defendant's actions on the administration of
justice;

(c)

Impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the representation;
and

(d)

Multiple instances of failure to participate in the legal profession's selfregulation process.

4.
Any sanction less than suspension would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of
the offenses committed by Defendant, would not adequately protect the public, and
would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct
expected of members of the Bar.
5.
The hearing panel considered the factors delineated in 27 N.CAC. 1B
ยง.0114(w)(2)(A) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and finds
the circumstances of this case do not warrant disbarment in order to protect the public.
6.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all disciplinary options and finds
reprimand, admonition or censure would not be sufficient discipline to protect the public,
clients or potential clients, and the profession. The hearing panel finds that any
discipline less than suspension stayed upon conditions would not be appropriate in this
case.

-6-

7.
The hearing panel finds and concludes that the public will be adequately
protected by suspension of Defendant's license, stayed for a period of time with
conditions imposed upon Defendant designed to ensure protection of the public and
Defendant's continued compliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Findings
Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel enters the following:
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
