2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27 N.C.
Admin, Code 18 § .0114(w)(2), of the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar, and
concludes the presence ofthe following factors that warrant disbannent
a.

acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication;

b.

misappropriation or conversion of assets of any kind to which the
defendant or recipient is not entitled, whether from a client or any other
source; and,

c.

commission of a telony,

3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the tllCtors enumerated in 27 N,C.
Admin, Code 1B § ,0l14(wj(3), of the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar, and
concludes the presence of the following faclors are applicable in this mutter;
a,

dishonest or selfish motive;
10

b,

pattern of misconduct;

c.

multiple otfenses; and,

d.

nearly five years of experience in the practice of law.

4.
By misappropriating entrusted client funds, Defendant has caused
significant hann to the standing of the legal profession in that his conduct undermines
the trust and confidence that the public has in lawyers and the legal system.
5.
Defendant caused significant hanll to his clients, Byrd's estate, Yarbro,
Quader, and Pad lick, by misappropriating their entrusted funds.
6.
Defendant caused significant harm to the profession by reinforcing tlle
negative stereotype that lawyers are selfish and out for personal gain.
7.
Defendant caused significant harm to the administration of justice in the
matters of his clients. Byrd's estate, Yarbro, Quader, and Padrick.
8.
The Hearing Punel has considered all lesser sanctions including:
suspension, censure, reprimand and admonition and finds that discipline less than
disbamlcnt would not adequately protect the public from Defendant's future misconduct
for the following reasons:
u.

Detendant committed a criminal act, specifically embezzlement,
that reflects adversely on his honesty, trustwolthiness or fitness as
a lawyer in other respects and violated the trust of Ilis clients,
Byrd's estate, Yarbro, QuadeI', and Padrick;

b.

erury of fUl order imposing less serious discipline would filil to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Defendant committed
and would send the wrong message to lawyers and the public
regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar of this
State; and,

c.

the protection of the public and the legal profession requires that
Defendant not he permitted to return to the practice of law ulltil he
demonstrates the following by clear, cogent and convincing
evidence: (i) that he has reformed, (ii) that he possesses the moral
qualifications required for admissioll to practice law in North

this order, (iii) that he understands the current Rules of
Professional Conduct, including but 110t limited to those Rules
relating to "Safekeeping Property" as sct f0l1h in Rule 1.15 et seq.;
and (iv) that reinstatement will not be detrimental to the public or
the integrity and standing of the legal profession. Disbarment is
the only discipline that will require Defendant to make such a
showing before I'ctuming to tbe practice of law.
