I, William J. Houck, hereby tender my license to practice
pursuant to Article IX, Section l7(a) of the Rules and
Regulations of the North Carolina state Bar and desire to resign
from the North Carolina State Bar.
My resignation is tendered

and I am fully aware of the implications of submitting this

Misappropriation of client funds of J White Iddings and
Robert Klinger.
Misappropriation of client funds from the trust account of
Mr. Joe Cagle, Attorney at Law.
Co-mingling of client and personal funds in my trust
accounts.
Neglect of client interests and cases.
I acknowledge that the material facts upon which the
grievances are predicated are true.
I am submitting my
resignation because I know that if charges were predicated upon
the misconduct under investigation, I could not successfully
defend against them.
