REPRIMAND

On July 21, 1999, the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar met and con$idered
the grievance filed against you by Mr. Richard Smith.
Pursuant to section .0113(a) of the Discipline and Disability Rules,ofthe North Carolina State
Bar, the Grievance Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the infonn~tion
available to it, including your response to th" letter 6f notice, the Grievance Committee found prob~1;Jle
cause. Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable cause to believe that a member ofthe North
Carolina State Bar is guilty of misconduct justifying disciplinary action."
The rules provide that after a fmding of probable cause, the Grievance Committee may
detennine that the filing of a complaint and a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing Commission are
not required, and the Grievance Committee may issue various levels of discipline depending upon the
misconduct, the actual or potential injury caus"d, and any aggravating or mitigating factors. The'
Grievance COnimjttee may issue an admonition, a reprimand, or a censure to the respondent attorney.
A repri~and is a written fonn of discipline more serious than an admonition issued in cases in
which an attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct and
has caused harm or potential harm to a client, the administr~tion of justice, the profession; or a member
of the public, but the misconduct does not require a censure.

I

The Grievance Committee was of the opinion that a censure is not required in this case and
issues this reprimanq to you. As chainnan of the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar;,
it is now my duty to issue this reprimand, and I am certain that you will understand fully the spirit ill
which this duty is perfonned.
In July 1998, you represented Mr. Smith's wife in a hearing on equitable distriblltion. At the
hearing, the judge awarded a Corvette to Mr. Smith. As you were preparing the order, you talked with
the judge and asked that he award the Corvette to your client. Mr. Smith's attorney, C. Lynn Gwaltney,
was not present when you had'this conversation with the judge. The judge agreed to change his initial
ruling and you prepared an order that allowed your client to receive the Corvette.
You did not give Mr. Smith's attorney, C. Lynn Gwaltney, oral or written prior notice ofyout
communication with the judge respecting a change in his initial ruling of the distribution of the car.

be a change in the judge's ruling regarding the ownership of the Corvette.

You sent Ms. Gwaltney t4e order you prepared in Mr. Smith's'case by a letter dated September
17, 1998. The judge signed the order the next day, September 18, 1998. The Grievance Committee '
found that you did not give Ms. Qwaltney adequate time to review the extensive order that you prepared,
particularly in light Qfthe chang~ ~hat you made to the order without Ms:Gwaltney's prior knowledge.
Your conduct in this regard violated
Rule ~.4(d) of the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct.
