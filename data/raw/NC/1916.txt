8. On September 16, 1991, the Prices' equitable 4istribution matter was heard before
. Judge Charles E. Rice, III. In his ruling announced from the bench, Judge Rice ordered that the
real property iocated at 1211 Snapper Lane at Carolina Beach, NC owned by the Prices

specifically distributed, the remainder of the proceeds to be equally divided.
