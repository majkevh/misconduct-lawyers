\'/'hich he held in a

any interest generated by their funas ~hile they remained in his
trust accol,utt nor did, he pay any of the irrterest earned on client
funds in the account to his clients.
26., Defendant did not not.1fy any of these clients that he
maintained their fund,s in an interest bearing account or that the
funds be:held on their behalf had earned any interest.
