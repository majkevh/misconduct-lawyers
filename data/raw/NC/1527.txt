PUBLIC CENSURE

~his PUblic Censure is delivereQ to you pursuant to Section 23 of the
Rules of Discipl..ine ~.nd. Dit.bar~nt 6f' the Nort.h Carolina state Bar and
purs~ant to a Consent Order of -Discipline of a Hearing Conunittee of the
Disciplin~ry Hearing Commission dated September 16, 1988" in the
above-entitled proceeding., whereih you admitted certain violations of the
Rules of Professional COI),duct of the North Carolina State Bar as set forth
below.

The fact that this P\Jb1ic Censure is not the most serious discipline
provided for in North Cat;'olina General statutes Section 84-28 should not be
taken by you to indicate that the North Carolina State Bar feels that your
conduct in this matter was excusable or was less than a very serious and
substantial vio1at:i;on of 'the Rules of Professional Conduct.
In 19'86, you formed a company known as Consumer Auto Claims service, for
the purpose of negotiat~ng and settling personal injury and pr9pert;y damage
claims inCUrred by membe'rs of the public in automobile ~ccidents. You were
the sole owner of ConsUmer Auto Claims Service (hereafter CACS) throughout its
operation from December, 1986, until June, 1987. You permitt~d a non-lawyer,
bavid Cannady, to operateCACS as an independent bu!;;iness between December,
1986, and approximately March 3, 1987. Cann?ldy was licensed as a "self
employed insurance -adju$ter" by the North Carolina Department of Insurance.
Between Dece~r, 1986, and March 3, 1997, Cannady negotiated ,ahd settled
claims for property damage and personal injury for members of 'the puP1ic. YoU
were aWc;lt'e of ~c;:l encouraged these activities·, which constituted the
Wliiuthorized :pr·~ctiteot law.

Between December, 1986, and approximately March 3, 1987, Cannady sent
letters to various insurance companies in which he represented himself ,as a
"se1£- employed insurance adj'uster." During the same time period, you caused
advertisements promoting CACS to be diSseminated to the public. These
advertisements failed to reveal the relationship between you and CACS.
On March, 3, 1987, you met with a representative of the North Caro1i'ria
state Bar who informed you that Cannady's activities constituted the
unauthorized practice of law. After this meetihg-, CACS was no ;Longer operated
independently of you~ law firm. In a letter to the North Carolina State Bar
dated March 26, 1987, you described CACS as the "claims div~sionfl of your law
firm. This 'statement. was misleading, inasmuch as you had been ,asked to
provide a full explanation of CACS' operations and because CACS became a part
ot your 1aWIIrm only after March 3, 1987.

In a letter to the NO,tth Carolina State Bar datE!d April 13, :L,98.7,you
stated that Cc¢nadyoperated CACS as your "empioyee~" Thi$ istatement was
misleading because you had been asked for a full explanation of CACS'
,
operations, and because Cannady had operated CACS as an independent.bus~hess
prior to March 3,1987. This'statement was ~lso misleading because YQ\! dic;1
not treat Cannady as your employee for tax purposes at any tim~ apc;1 beijaQse
you had allowed Cannady to ho:J.d .himself out to the public asa "$elf employed
