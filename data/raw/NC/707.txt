Based upon the consent of the parties, tlle hearing panel also finds by clear,
cogent, and convincing evidence the following

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.

Defendant has substantial experience in the practice oflaw.

2.
Defendant's conduct caused significant harm to his clients, who were
vulnerable because they were unfamiliar with the legal process and relied upon
Defendant to protect their legal rights. Specifically, Defendant's conduct significantly
delayed, impaired, or eliminated his clients' abilities to pursue their respective legal
claims, as well as caused the loss of paid legal fees without satisfactorily progressing on
or completing the matters for which he was retained. Defendant's neglect and eventual
abandonment of his clients and law practice also demonstrates his intent to act in a way
tllat resulted in foreseeable significant harm to his clients and reflects on Defendant's
lack of honesty, trustworthiness, and integrity.
3.
Defendant's conduct not only harmed his clients' ability to resolve their
legal matters but also demonstrated an ongoing pattem of neglectful conduct and an
elevation of Defendant's interests above those of his clients in that Defendant abandoned
his law practice without notifying his clients or taking any steps to ensure his clients'
matters would be properly handled and their rights protected.
4.
After abandoning his law practice and leaving the State, Defendant did not
provide his clients with any contact infonnation and made no efforts to commtmicate
with his clients to ensure tlleir rights and pending matters were properly preserved for
subsequent counsel, including retuming their client files or refunding any unearned paid
legal fees. Defendant's inaction concerning his clients after abandoning his practice
demonstrates Defendant's indifference to making restitution for his clients.
5.
Defendant's failure to respond to multiple inquiries from the State Bar
demonstrates a refusal to participate in the self-regulation process. Such conduct
interferes with the State Bar's ability to regulate its members and undermines the
profession's privilege to remain self-regulating.
12

6.
Defendant's habitual neglect of his clients' matters has the potential to
cause significant harm to the standing of the legal profession in the eyes of the public
because it shows his disregard for his duties as an attorney. Such erosion of public
confidence in attorneys tends to sully the reputation of, and fosters disrespect for, the
profession as a whole. Confidence in the legal profession is a building block for public
trust in the entire legal system.
7.
Defendant's conduct caused significant harnl to the public and to the
administration ofjustice by unnecessarily delaying resolution of his clients' pending
cases and subjecting the cases to procedural resolution, rather than substantive or meritbased resolution. Justice is achieved when all matters subjected to litigation are resolved
on their merits and not as a result of procedural problems such as those created by
Defendant.
8.
Between 2008 and 20 I0, Defendant experienced a number of personal
tragedies resulting from health complications for himself and his family members. These
numerous incidents distracted Defendant from his law practice and weighed heavily on
Defendant's emotional and mental state to the detriment of his clients and his law
practice.
Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel also enters the following
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the hearing panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง .0l14(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and finds the following factors are applicable in this matter:
a. Defendant's indifference to making restitution;
b. Defendant's pattern of misconduct;
c. Defendant engaged in multiple offenses;
d. The effect of Defendant's personal problems on the conduct in question;
e. The vulnerability of the victims; and
f.

Defendant's substantial experience in the practice oflaw.

2.
The hearing panel has also considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. IB ยง .0114(w)(I) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar
and finds thc following factors warrant suspension of Defendant's license:
a. Defendant's intent to commit acts where the harm or potential harm was
foreseeable;
13

b. Circumstances reflecting Defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness, or
integrity;
c. Elevation of Defendant's own interests above that of his clients;
d. Defendant's actions had a potential negative impact on his clients' and the
public's perception of the legal profession;
e. Defendant's conduct had a negative impact on the administration of
justice;
f.

Defendant's conduct impaired each client's ability to achieve the goals of
the representation; and

g. Defendant's multiple instances of failure to participate in the legal
profession's self-regulation process.
3.
Any sanction less than suspension would fail to acknowledge the
seriousness of the offenses committed by Defendant, would not adequately protect the
public, and would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the
conduct expected of members of the Bar.
4.
Due to the extensive client neglect described in the present action and due
to Defendant's continued refusal to participate in the self-regulating process of the North
Carolina State Bar, the hearing panel finds and concludes that the public will only be
adequately protected by imposing a period of active suspension of Defendant's law
license.
5.
Defendant should be allowed the opportunity to apply for a stay of a
portion of the suspension imposed by this Order upon compliance with certain conditions
designed to ensure protection ofthe public and to ensure Defendant's compliance with
the Rules of Professional Conduct.
