members Fred M. Morelock and Joe Castro. Jennifer A. Porter represented Plaintiff, the
North Carolina State Bar. Defendant appeared pro se.
Based upon the pleadings, the stipulated facts, and the evidence introduced at the
hearing, the hearing panel hereby finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the
following
FINDINGS OF FACT
I.
Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar ("State Bar"), is a body duly
organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this

Title 27 of the North Carolina Administrative Code).

law licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the laws of the State of North
Carolina, the Ru1es and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and the Rules of
Professional Conduct.

Harley was closing attorney for nwnerous residential real estate closings

Harley disbursed more funds to certain individuals/entities than had been collected for
those individuals/entities. Harley also failed to pay items from closings. In some
instances, her handling of the funds left a positive balance for a closing, but the balance
was not sufficient to cover the disbursements she had failed to make. Closings in which

Harley failed to receive and/or disburse funds as reflected on the HUD-I Settlement
Statements include:

14.
Harley disbursed $5,500.00 to Robert Gunter by check number 3848 on or
about August 1,2007. Harley did not have $5,500.00 in her trust account for Gunter at
that time, and this disbursement utilized other clients' funds in her trust account. Harley
did not deposit $5,500.00 for Gunter into her trust account until August 16,2007.
15.
Harley collected more for herself than the amounts identified on the
applicable HUD-l Settlement Statements as being disbursed to her in real estate closings,
including in the following closings:
a. Buyer/borrower Erskine and Cora Hawkins, settlement date June 10, 2005
b. Buyer/borrower Gene Burns, settlement date June 17,2005
16.
The I-IUD-I Settlement Statement for the closing with buyerlborrower
Gene Burns, settlement date June 17, 2005, reflects funds received from Mr. Burns in the
amount of$8,598.97. The HUD-l Settlement Statement identifies disbursements to
Harley totaling $325.00. Harley received a check for $8,850.00 for this closing. Instead
of depositing the $8,850.00 into her trust account, Harley deposited $8,500.00 of those
4

funds into her trust account and received $3S0.00 in cash by means of the "less cash
received" line of her deposit form.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the hearing panel enters the following
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
I.
All the parties are properly before the Disciplinary Hearing Commission
and the Disciplinary Hearing Commission has jurisdiction over the Defendant, LaShon
Harley, and the subject matter,
2.
Defendant's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes

Rule 1.15-3(a)(l

i;

(g)

By failing to provide annual accountings to clients for whom she had
funds in her general trust account, Harley failed to provide requisite
accountings of entrusted funds in violation of Rule 1.15-3(d)J;

(h)

By having personal funds in her trust account and by disbursing funds

violation of Rule l.15-2(t);

(i)

account and instead receiving funds back (either in cash or cashier check

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and upon the
evidence and arguments presented at the hearing concerning appropriate discipline, the
hearing panel hereby finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following
additional
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
Defendant knowingly failed to complete title work for clients and
knowingly failed to disburse title insurance prerniums to the title insurance companies in
a timely manner. As a result, lenders and borrowers who thought they had obtained title

'The current version of this rule is Rule 1.15-3(b)(l), amended March 6, 2008

insurance coverage in fact did not have title insurance coverage. In this manner,
Defendant's conduct impaired her clients from achieving that goal of the representation.
2.
Although the potential harm from Defendant's failure to obtain title
insurance policies was foreseeable, Defendant did not intend to cause the harm that could
have resulted to the lender and the buyer from not having title insurance coverage should
a title problem arise.
3.
Defendant's conduct has negatively affected title insurance companies
which issued title commitments and insured closing letters for transactions Defendant
closed but for which she failed to complete final title opinions or send title insurance
premiums. Chicago Title Insurance Company has had to process claims filed under the
insured closing letter coverage, which lasts for three years. Chicago Title has had to
retain other counsel to issue final title opinions in two matters in which claims were filed
under the insured closing letter coverage, and bore the expense of those attorneys' fees.
The remainder of the approximate 12 files for which Chicago Title has not received final
title opinions from Defendant remain in an unsettled status because of the title
commitments and insured closing letters that were issued.
4.
Defendant knowingly failed to reconcile her trust account, to track and
determine what funds she had for which clients in her trust account, and to send her
clients annual accountings of funds being held in trust on their behalf for several years.
The actual harm to clients or third parties has been minimal in relation to the detriment
that could have been caused.
5.
Whil e Defendant did not intentionally act contrary to the Rules of
Professional Conduct regarding trust accounts, Defendant made no effort to become
familiar with those rules. This is unacceptable for an attorney whn handles entrusted
funds and poses an immense risk to the clients and third parties.
6.
Although Defendant has been aware that she has not been reconciling her
trust account and has not been confident of how much money she has in her trust account
for which clients and for what purposes for several years, she has not made any
significant progress in sorting through her documentation and identifying client funds in
her trust account until her preparation for the hearing in this disciplinary case.
7.
Defendant's conduct, as alleged in the State Bar's complaint and found by
the hearing panel to have been proven by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, was
known to the public and her clients. One client saw the State Bar's complaint on the
State Bar's website and contacted Defendant with concerns.
8.

Defendant has had no prior disciplinary action taken against her law

license.
9.
During the time period at issue in this matter, Defendant was left as the
sole attorney in the law office handling administrative matters and most legal matters.

7

Defendant was also assisting a law partner who had left the firm and other attorneys with
their cases. These duties and obligations in addition to the duties and obligations she had
from her own cases became overwhelming to Defendant.
10.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all available forms of
discipline available, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and
disbarment, in determining what level of discipline is appropriate and necessary to
protect the public.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Findings of Fact
Regarding Discipline, and upon the evidence and arguments presented at the hearing
concerning appropriate discipline, the hearing panel hereby enters the following
additional
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The hearing panel has carefully considered the factors listed in
Rule .OI14(w) of the North Carolina State Bar Discipline and Disability Rules. The
hearing panel finds the following factors established by clear, cogent, and convincing
evidence:
a. From Rule .01 14(w)(l):
J,

Subsection (B), intent of the defendant to commit acts where the
harm or potential harm is foreseeable.

ii. Subsection (E), negative impact of defendant's actions on the
clients' or public's perception of the profession.
iii. Subsection (G), impairment of the client's ability to achieve the
goals ofthe representation.
iv. Subsection (H), effect of defendant's conduct on third parties, most
particularly Chicago Title Insurance Company.
b. From Rule .01 14(w)(3):
i. Subsection (A), no prior disciplinary offenses.
11.

Subsection (E), a lack of any timely good faith efforts to make
restitution or rectify the consequences of this conduct.

iii. Subsection (G), multiple offenses.
iv. Subsection (H), effect of personal or emotional problems on the
conduct at issue, particularly the imposition of other attorneys
upon Defendant such that she was overwhelmed with
administrative duties.
8

v. Subsection (K), full and free disclosure, to the best of Defendant's
ability, to the hearing panel and a cooperative attitude toward the
proceedings.
vi. Subsection (Q), character or reputation of integrity as discussed in
character letters Defendant provided.
vii. Subsection (S), although Defendant has been engaged in the
practice of law since 2002, she did not have experience to draw on
when she began her recordkeeping practices which were involved
in the subsequent trust account problems found herein.
2.
Defendant's failure to tend to her trust account, to ensure she knew whose
money she held for whom, and to complete disbursements for clients posed a significant
threat of harm to her clients, caused actual significant harm to Chicago Title, and, if
allowed to continue, poses significant potential harm to future clients and the reputation
of the profession.
3.
When an attorney neglects client matters and mishandles entrusted funds,
it reflects negatively on the profession and causes potential significant harm to the
public's trust of the profession.
4.
Defendant has had a long time to identify the client funds in her trust
account and determine appropriate disbursements. Although Defendant has made
progress in identifying client funds and to whom disbursements should be made in the
course of this disciplinary action, she still has not completed this identification and has
not made the disbursements. Continued attention by the State Bar is required to ensure
Defendant completes this process.
5.
Based upon the foregoing facts and conclusions of law, entry of an order
of discipline with a significant suspension of Defendant's law license that is stayed only
as long as Defendant complies with certain conditions is necessary to protect the public
from future transgressions of this attorney.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Findings of Fact
Regarding Discipline, and Conclusions Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel hereby
enters the following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1.
Defendant, LaShon A. Harley, is hereby suspended from the practice of
law in North Carolina for three years.
