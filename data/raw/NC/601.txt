her legal fees in P. Gallo's case would be $300.00.
12.
Freeman's April 1, 2014 letter to P. Gallo stated he would also have to submit
payment for court costs and fines.
13.
P. Gallo signed Freeman's April 1, 2014 letter on or about April 8, 2014 and
returned the letter to Freeman.
14.
Freeman's goals in her representation ofP. Gallo included resolving his case with
a plea to a lesser violation that did not include the work zone violation.
15.
Freeman sent P. Gallo an e-mail dated April 11, 2014 in which she advised P. Gallo
that in North Carolina work zone speeding violations normally carry an additional fine of$250.00,
that she would have him include that fine in the total payment she had him send her, and she would
"return it to [him] in the form of a reimbursement check if it is not mandated by the court that [he]
pay it."
16.
On April 18,2014, Freeman received $800.00 from P. Gallo, which she deposited
into the trust account.
17.

for the anticipated court costs and fines.

2014 e-mail to P. Gallo.
23.

Freeman did not refund $237.00 from the trust account to P. Gallo.

through cash withdrawals, transfers, and disbursements of funds to herself or for her benefit from
the trust account to which she was not entitled.
25.
Freeman failed to refund P. Gallo his $237.00 and failed to maintain P. Gallo's
funds in the trust account for P. Gallo unless and until those funds were either properly utilized for
P. Gallo or refunded to P. Gallo, thereby failing to properly maintain and disburse entrusted funds
and improperly disbursing entrusted funds for her benefit.

102. Freeman had the ability on the withdrawal authorization form used to make these
cash withdrawals to identify the client from whose funds in the trust account she was purportedly
disbursing funds.

finds by clear, cogent and convincing evidence the following additional
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.

The findings of fact in paragraphs 1 - 246 above are reincorporated as if set forth

herein.
2.
Freeman engaged in multiple instances of misappropriation of entrusted funds,
which is a criminal act that tarnishes her honesty, trustwOlihiness, and fitness as a lawyer.
3.
Client E. Shoemaker testified that, after her experience with Freeman taking money
from her and not refunding her money to her, she will be more cautious with trusting money to
attorneys in the future.

The North Carolina State Bar v. Carson W. Freeman, 17 DHC 35
Order of Discipline

Page 30 of34

4.
Proper maintenance and management of entrusted funds is a cornerstone of the
public's trust in the legal profession. Embezzlement is one of the most serious offenses an attorney
can commit, betraying the client's trust in the attorney and the public's trust in the legal profession.
Freeman's misappropriation caused significant harm to the standing of the legal profession,
undermining trust and confidence in lawyers and the legal system.
5.
Freeman's misappropriation of client funds occurred at times of demonstrated
personal financial need.
6.
Freeman caused significant harm to clients whose funds she failed to safeguard and
whose funds she misappropriated.
7.
Freeman's misappropriation of funds caused significant hmID and potential
significant harm, creating the foreseeable risk that Freeman would not have the necessary funds
available to pay court costs and fines for clients such as A. Michael, discussed above, whose funds
she failed to safeguard and maintain in trust.
8.
Freeman's misappropriation of her clients' funds betrayed the trust placed in her by
her clients to properly maintain and disburse their entrusted client funds.
9.

Freeman put her own personal interests ahead ofthe interests of her clients.

10.

Freeman established a general reputation for good character.

11.
Freeman cooperated with the State Bar's investigation, timely responding to the
State Bar's inquiries and providing the requested records. Freeman has also had a cooperative
attitude toward the DHC proceedings.
12.

Freeman expressed remorse during the DHC proceedings.

13.
Freeman took steps to educate herself regarding the rules applicable to attorney
trust accounts and proper trust account record-keeping after she was contacted by the State Bar
after the NSF discussed above.
14.

Freeman has not received prior discipline.

15.
Freeman should have known better than to engage in these acts that have led to the
discipline imposed in this order.
16.
The Hearing Panel finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the facts
contained in the conclusions it makes, set out below, of the applicable factors regarding discipline
from those listed in 27 N.C. Admin. Code IB.OI16(f).
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following

CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearing Panel carefully considered all of the different forms of discipline
available to it.
2.
The Hearing Panel considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code 1B.Ol16(t)(1), (2) and (3) of the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar and concluded that
the following factors are applicable:
27 N.C. Admin. Code. 1B.Ol16(t)(1)
a.

Factor (B), Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential
harm is foreseeable;

b.

Factor (C), Circumstances reflecting Defendant's lack of honesty,
trustwOlihiness, or integrity;

c.

Factor (D), Elevation of Defendant's own interest above that of the client;

d.

Factor (E), Negative impact of Defendant's actions on client's and public's
perception of the profession;

e.

Factor (I), Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication.

27 N.C. Admin. Code 1B.Ol16(t)(2)
a.

Factor (A), Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication;

b.

Factor (B), Impulsive acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or
fabrication without timely remedial efforts;

c.

Factor (C), Misappropriation or conversion of assets of any kind to which
Defendant or recipient was not entitled;

d.

Factor (D), Commission of a felony;

27 N.C. Admin. Code 1B.Ol16(t)(3)
a.

Factor (A), The absence of disciplinary offenses;

b.

Factor (C), Dishonest or selfish motive;

c.

Factor (D), Timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify
consequences of misconduct;

d.

Factor (G), Multiple offenses;

e.

Factor (1), Interim rehabilitation;

The NOIth Carolina State Bar v. Carson W. Freeman, 17 DHC 35
Order of Discipline

Page 32 of34

f.

Factor (K), Full and free disclosure to the hearing panel and a cooperative
attitude toward the proceedings;

g.

Factor (P), Remorse;

h.

Factor (Q), Good character and reputation, generally;

1.

Factor (S), Minimal degree of experience in the practice of law;

J.

Factor (V) Other factors, to wit:
1.

The attorney from whom Freeman sought mentoring did not provide the
mentoring skills that Freeman relied upon when she took up the
relationship of sharing an office space with him.

3.
A lawyer's misappropriation of entrusted funds reflects poorly upon the profession
and engenders a lack of trust and confidence in lawyers, causing potential significant harm to the
public and the profession. If people don't trust lawyers, they will not trust the law. Trust in the
rule oflaw and our legal system is integral to orderly resolution of conflict in our society.
4.
The Hearing Panel considered all of the disciplinary options available to it and
determined that disbarment is appropriate.
5.
The Hearing Panel has considered all lesser sanctions and finds that discipline shOlt
of disbarment would not adequately protect the public for the following reasons:
a.

Freeman engaged in misconduct constituting felonies and violations of the
trust of her clients and the public;

b.

Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Freeman committed and would
send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct
expected of members of the Bar of this State; and

c.

The protection of the public and the legal profession requires that Freeman
not be permitted to resume the practice of law until she demonstrates the
following: that she has reformed; that she understands her obligations to her
clients, the public, the COUltS, and the legal profession; and that
reinstatement will not be detrimental to the public or the integrity and
standing of the legal profession. The State Bar rule on reinstatement, 27
N.C. Admin. Code IB.0129, requires disball'ed lawyers to make such a
showing before they may resume practicing law, whereas no such showing
of reformation is required by the rule of attorneys whose licenses are
suspended.
