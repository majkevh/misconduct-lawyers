19.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and
disbarment, in considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
Based on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO DISCIPLINE

1.
The HeaTing Panel has carefully considered all of the factors enumerated
in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง.OI14(w)(l) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors are present which warrant suspension of
Defendant's license:
(B)

Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential harm was
foreseeable;

(C)

Circumstances reflecting Defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness, or
integrity;

(E)

Defendant's actions potentially had a negative impact on the public's
perception of the legal profession; and,

(I)

Defendant's acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication.

2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors ennmerated in
27N.C.A.C. IB ยง.01l4(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the NOlth Carolina State
Bar and conclndes that the following disbarment factors are present:
(A)

Defendant's acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication;
and,

(D)

Defendant's commission of a felony.

3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง.Ol14(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(A)

Absence of prior disciplinary offenses in this state or other jurisdictions;

(C)

Absence of selfish motive;

ยท5ยท

(D)

Timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify the
consequences of Defendant's misconduct;

(G)

Multiple offenses;

(H)

Effect of any personal or emotional problems on the conduct in question;

(1)

Effect of any physical or mental disability 01' impairment on the conduct in
question;

(J)

Interim rehabilitation;

(K)

Full and free disclosure to the hearing panel and cooperative attitude
toward the proceedings;

(P)

Defendant's remorse;

(Q)

Defendant's character or reputation; and,

(U)

Imposition of other penalties or sanctions.

4.
The Hearing Panel has considered issuing an admonition, reprimand or
censure but concludes that such discipline would not be sufficient discipline because of
the gravity of the misconduct at issue, the halm or potential harm Defendant's
misconduct caused to the public, the administration of justice, and the legal profession,
and because of the Hearing Panel's concern for the protection of the public.
5.
McEnery's crimes and felony conviction caused significant harm to his
fi'iends and resulted in potential significant harm by breeding disrespect for the legal
profession but the criminal conduct would not have been committed but for his drug
addiction.
6.
Given the aberrant nature of McEnery's crimes and felony conviction, his
timely admission to drug treatment intervention, his initiative and leadership during
rehabilitation, and his commitment to recovery and sobriety, the Hearing Panel deemed
the factors found under 27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง.Ol14(w)(2) insufficient to warrant disbarment.
7.
For the following reasons, this Hearing Panel finds that an order imposing
discipline short of suspension of Defendant's law license would not adequately protect
the public, the legal profession, or the administration of justice for the following reasons:
(a)

While the Hearing Panel found two factors under 27 N.C.A.C. IB
ยง.0114(w)(2), these factors do not require disbarment when
weighed with the factors founds under 27 N.C.A.C. 1B
ยง.Ol14(w)(l) and (w)(3);

ยท6ยท

(b)

The factors under 27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง.01l4(w)(l) and (w)(3) that
are established by the evidence are of a nature that support
imposition of suspension as the appropriate discipline;

(c)

Entry of less serious discipline would fail to acknowledge the
seriousness of the offenses Defendant committed and would send
the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the
conduct expected of members of the Bar in this State; and,

(d)

A stayed suspension with appropriate conditions, such as requiring
McEnery to continue his recovery therapy and periodic reporting
by the therapist and LAP to the State Bar, will assure Defendant's
sobriety and compliance with treatment.

Based upon the foregoing findings of fact, conclusions oflaw, and the findings of
fact and conclusions regarding discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
