name in the letterhead. Below Culbertson's name in the printed letterhead, surroUnded by
parentheses, is another asterisk with the phrase "Published in Federal Reports, 3d.S'eries.;'

I

5. Culbertson also maintains a website. In the description of Culbertson on his website,
Culbertson ~tates: '""th]e is also one of the elite percentage ,of attorneys to be published in
Federai Law Reports - the large law books that contain the controlling caselaw [sic] of the
United States."

i

6. B;ecause only opinions issued by the Court are published in Federal Reports,

following:

I

1. All parties are properly before the hearing committee and the committee has
, jurisdiction over'Culbertson and the subject matter.

arguments 01 counsel, the hearing committee hereby enters the following:
