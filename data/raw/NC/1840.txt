or illegal fees in viQlation of Rule 2.6 and failed to hold .in
her trust account funds to which she m.ight be entitled as fees
until actually authorized to receive the fee, in viol.ation of
Rule 10.1(C) (2).
2. By failing to adequately supervise her staff and 'by'
failing to pr(~vent' the filing of fee petitions regarding AI.ma
Phillips, Ruby Speil]hts, Lo·ra Adams, Melissa Capps; and Bertha
Massey which falsely represented that these clients' fees Were
being held in trust, Huntsbe:t;'ry engaged in. conduct prejudi,cial, to,
the ad~inistration of justice in violation of Rule 1.2(0) and
failed to ensure that her paralegal's conduct was compatible withher own professional obligations, in violation of Rule 3.3.
3. By failing to provide a full and fair disclosure of all

alleged in Capps' grievance in her initial response to the
grievance and by failing to respond promptly to Bar Counsel's
letterS! of July 1,3, 1993 and Oct. 5, 1993 and to inquiries from

In addition to the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions
of Law, based upon the parties' consent, the Hearing Committee
enters the following:
FINDINGS REGARDING AGGRAVATING & MITIGATING FACTORS
1.

Huntsberry's conduct is aggravated by the follQwing

factors:
a~
Huntsberry was reprimanded on October 17, 1990 for
failing to hold fees collected in social Security cases between
1986 and 1988 in trust. Huntsberry was served with the letter of
notice in that case in December 1988 and thus was on notice of
the need to hold fees 1n trust at the t1me of the m1sconduct
referred to herein.
I

•

•

•

I

•

b. Huntsberry was publicly censured on July 11, 1991
for telling the state Bar in January 1991 that the fee paid to
her by a client named Evelyn Ellis was in her trust account and
that a petition had been filed when this was not the case.
Huntsberrywas served with the letter of notice in the Ellis case
on Dec. 27, 1990.
2. Huntsberry's conduct is mitigated by the following
factors:
.
a.

The misconduct referred to herein occurred prior to
1992.

b.

records indicates that she opened a new trust
account in June 1991 and that the funds in that
account have been handled properly.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
Law, Findings Regarding Aggravating & Mitigating Factors and the
parties' consent, the Hearing Committee hereby enters the
following: i
