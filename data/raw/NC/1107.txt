ORDER OF ATTORNEY
DISCIPLINE
(REPRIMAND)

By and with the consent of Kristin Ruth, the Court exercises its inherent authority to
discipline attorneys for professional misconduct.
From the evidence of record, the Court finds that Kristin Ruth has violated Rule 8.4( d) of
the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct of Attorneys.
Attorney Kristin Ruth having entered a plea of guilty to the misdemeanor of failing to
properly discharge duties of her office as a District Court Judge by failing to read orders
presented for her signature before signing such orders; AND the Court having determined that
Kristin Ruth did not act with any criminal intent nor with any intent to knowingly cause harm to
the proper administration of justice, but instead the sole professional deficiency of Kristin Ruth
was a failure to exercise due care and caution and diligence as a judge; AND the Court further
finding that Kristin Ruth was at all times honest and cooperative throughout the investigation of
this matter and immediately resigned her office as District Court Judge to minimize any injury to
the reputation of the judiciary in Wake County that her negligent conduct may have caused;
AND the Court having continued judgment in the criminal case filed against her; AND Kristin

Ruth having agreed not to seek or hold judicial office in the future; AND there being no

likelihood that this deficient conduct will reoccur; AND that Kristin Ruth has always possessed
an outstanding professional reputation as a judge, as a lawyer and as a citizen in this community;
THEREFORE, it is the order of this Court that Kristin Ruth be, and hereby is,
reprimanded for her deficient conduct which was prejudicial to the proper administration of

justice in the courts of Wake County and which reflected poorly upon the legal profession.
A copy of this Order of Reprimand shall be filed with the Clerk of Superior Court and
forwarded to the North Carolina State Bar.
So ordered this, the

/ 1 day of December, 2012.
