The State Bar requested N. Clayton confirm compliance with Rule 1.15 of the
Rules of Professional Conduct by providing a trust account reconciliation.

12.
On December 6, 2016, the State Bar served J. Clayton with a letter of notice
concerning a notice' of insufficient funds received by the State Bar concerning the firm's trust
account.
13.
The State Bar asked J. Clayton to include in his response to the letter of notice a
copy of the firm's most recent three-way reconciliation for the firm's trust account along with
supporting documentation. The three-way quarterly reconciliation required under Rule 1.153(d)(1) that would have been most recent to the State Bar's request would have been for the third
quarter of2016.

14.
A response signed by J. Clayton dated December 14, 2016 was received by the
State Bar but it did not include the requested three-way quarterly reconciliation with supporting
documents.
On February 16, 2017, the State Bar sent J. Clayton a letter calling to his attention
15.
his failure to provide the requested reconciliation and supporting documents, and asked him to
provide the reconciliation and documents by March 3, 2017.
16.
J. Clayton did not respond to the State Bar's February 16, 2017 letter and did not
provide the requested three-way quarterly reconciliation.

bookkeeper had,instructed the firm's staff to give her letters from the State Bar directed to
J. Clayton.

19.
In response, N. Clayton prepared documentation consisting of three~way
reconciliation forms and supporting documents and arranged for the documentation to be
delivered to the State Bar.
20.
The supporting documents attached to the three-way reconciliation fonns
included printed reports from the firm's trust account software and trust account records printed
from the bank's website.
21.
The date on which certain of those software reports and website records were
printed was covered with white-out tape on documents attached to each month's reconciliation
form.
22.
The covered date was March 27, 2017 on records containing white-out tape
attached to the July, August, September, October, and December 2016 reconciliations, with the
exception of one of the reports attached to the December 2016 reconciliation which had a
covered date ofJanuary 26, 2017.
23.
The covered date was March 26,2017 on bank records printed from the bank's
website included with the November 2016 reconciliation.
24.
There were handwritten reconciliation notations on certain of the documents with
covered March 2017 print dates, including those attached to the reconciliations for August 2016,
September 2016, October 2016, November 2016, and December 2016.
Subsequent inquiries to all Defendants
25.
The State Bar served all Defendants by certified mail with requests that each
respond to the concern that they had attempted to mislead the State Bar regarding when the
reconciliations produced on March 27, 2017 had been conducted by covering the print dates with
white-out tape, and to the concern that the finn was stilI not timely reconciling its trust account
since it appeared that these reconciliations for July through December 2016 had not been done
until March 26 and 27,2017.
26.
J. Clayton was served with the State Bar's request by certified mail on March 30,
2017. His response was due on Apri128, 2017. J. Clayton failed to respond to the State Bar's
letter. Due to the above referenced diversion of mail, J. Clayton did not discover this inquiry to
him until his receipt of the State Bar's May 5, 2017 letter to him regarding his failure to respond,
referenced below.
27.
R. McClanahan was served with the State Bar's request contained in a letter of
notice by certified mail on April 4, 2017. His response was due on April 19, 2017.
R. McClanahan failed to respond to the State Bar's letter of notice. R. McClanahan was
transitioning to a semi-retired status during this time and was rarely in the office, although the
firm's address remained his address of record with the State Bar. R. McClanahan did not
become aware of the letter of notice until after the deadline to respond had passed.
28.

R. Myrick responded by letter dated April 12,2017, in which he stated:

Consent Order of Discipline, 17 DRC 25, as to Defendants
1. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, R. Coulter

Page 4 of 12

a. He did not prepare and was not involved with the preparation of the documents
produced in response to the subpoena, and was unaware at the time of the
subpoena which the firm signed for on his behalf but of which he was not
notified.
b. He is not present in the finn on a regular basis.
c. Although he utilized the firm's trust account he was not involved in the
management or reconciliation of the trust account. He believed that the firm was
audited by the State Bar the prior year and was found to be in compliance with the
State Bar rules.
29.

R. Coulter responded by letter dated April 13,2017, in which he stated:

a

Although he utilized the finn's trust account, in his role he was not involved in
the management or reconciliation of the trust account. He stated the finn's
bookkeeper worked with N. Clayton to manage all banking accounts of the finn,
including the trust account.

b. He believed the finn had recently been successfully audited by the State Bar.
c. He understood that the firm's trust account had been reconciled monthly for years
within ten days of month's end by the office bookkeeper with oversight by
N. Clayton.
d. N. Clayton told him that as she printed out previously obtained fonns for
submission to the State Bar, the computer she used automatically printed the date
of printing on the documents. She could have reprinted the fonns on another
computer with no date added, but saw no problem with removing the dates that
would have incorrectly indicated when the statements were prepared.

30.

N. Clayton responded in a letter dated Apri128, 2017, in which she stated:
:I,

Since she met with the State Bar deputy counsel the preceding year [on November
10, 2016J, the finn began doing the three-way reconciliations monthly between
the 5th and lOth day of each month.

b. She reviewed the documents to be delivered to the State Bar late on the night of
March 26, 2017. She noticed that on many of the documents there were a lot of
scribbles and notes from where the reconciliation had been done and she reprinted
the documents. She did so because she wanted to provide the State Bar with
copies of documents that didn't have so much "chicken scratch" on them. When
she printed off clean copies, one of the computers she used printed the date of
printing on the documents.
c. The printed date alarmed her because she did not want the State Bar to thitik the
reports were being printed just for compliance with the SUbpoena.

Page 5 of12

d. She wasn't sure what to do, but decided to white-out the date on the documents
she had reprinted.
e. R. Coulter pointed out to her that she had not filled in the date on the top page of
when the reconciliations were performed. She told him they were prepared
between the 5th and loth of each month.
31.
On April 13, 2017, the State Bar wrote to R. Myrick and called to his attention
comment [27] of Rule 1.15 discussing the professional responsibility of any lawyer who deposits
entrusted funds into a trust account regardless of whether the lawyer directly participates in the
administration of the trust account. R. Myrick was invited to provide any additional response he
wished to have considered by May 12, 2017.
32.
On April 17, 2017, the State Bar wrote to R. Coulter and noted the same
information from comment [27] of Rule 1.15. Additionally, the State Bar called to R. Coulter's
attention that the firm had not successfully completed its random audit, and that the documents
with the whited-out dates were not previously obtained forms but rather electronically accessed
bank records and software reports containing handwritten reconciliation notes made after the
records were printed. R. Coulter was invited to provide any additional response he wished to
have considered by May 12,2017.
33.
On April 28, 2017, the State Bar sent N. Clayton a letter asking her to explain
why she had failed to provide the three-way reconciliations repeatedly requested of her on
November 10, 2016, January 4, 2017, and February 7, 2017 prior to the issuance of the
subpoenas, if the reconciliations had been done monthly as she claimed. The State Bar also
asked for the original documents with "scribbles and notes" that she claimed to have replaced
with clean documents on which she whited-out the print dates. N. Clayton's response was due
May 19, 2017.
34.
On May 1, 2017, the State Bar sent R. McClanahan a letter noting his failure to
respond to the letter of notice served upon him on April 4, 2017.
35.
On May 5, 2017, the State Bar sent a letter to J. Clayton noting his failure to
respond to the State Bar's letter served upon him on March 30, 2017, and asking him to provide
his response by May 19,2017.
36.
On May 9,2017, R. McClanahan responded to the State Bar's May 1, 2017 letter
and stated the firm delivered all subpoenaed documents and he had not received any response to
those materials.
37.
On May 10, 2017, the State Bar responded to R. McClanahan that the letter of
notice expressly addressed the documents delivered by the firm and required his response to
concerns raised by those documents. R. McClanahan was given until May 26, 2017 to provide a
response that addressed the issues raised in the letter of notice.

Response from all Defendants
On May 26, 2017, Defendants sent the State Bar a letter, signed by each
38.
Defendant. [n this letter, the Defendants stated the following:
a. The finn is performing three-way reconciliations monthly, between the 5th and
lOlh of each month.
b. In preparation for submission of the documents on March 27, 2017, N. Clayton
reviewed the documents and reaHzed many of the documents contained scribbles
and notes from where the reconciliation had been done. Therefore, she reprinted
the documents on March 27, 2017.
c. When she reprinted the documents on March 27, 2017, the date of printing was
automatically printed on the documents, which would give the false impression
that the reconciliations were perfonned on March 27, 2017.
d. The above explanation addresses the second concern raised by the State Bar in the
Defendants' grievances, in that the State Bar alleged that they attempted to
mislead the State Bar concerning when the reconciliations were conducted by
applying, or directing another to apply, white-out tape to dates showing the
supporting trust account reports and bank documents were printed on March 26
and March 27, 2017.
e. While the documents were printed on March 26 and March 27, 2017, the actual
reconciliations provided to the State Bar were conducted between the 5th and lOth
of each month.

f

The ftrm had elected to utilize the multi-lawyer finn procedures of Rule 1.15-4
and anticipated providing the attendant documentation to the State Bar within the
following two weeks.

g. Regarding the State Bar's request for the pages with "scribbles" that were
purportedly replaced with the reprinted pages, the shredding company was
retrieving the documents and the finn would provide them to the State Bar the
following week.

39.

N. Clayton was the source of the information for the statements made in the May

26, 20171etter.
40.
The statement made by Defendants in the May 26, 2017 letter that the
reconciliations provided to the State Bar had been conducted between the 5th and 10th of each
month during the pertinent time period was inaccurate. N. Clayton had admitted she had not
even started using the three-way reconciliation fonn until after November 2016, and the
supporting documents dated March 2017 containing her reconciliation notes indicate the
reconciliations provided to the State Bar were done in March 2017.

Consent Order of Discipline, 17 DHC 25, as to Defendants
1. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, R. Coulter

Page 7 of12

41.
The statement made by Defendants in the May 1.6, 1.U 17 letter that the pages with
whited-out dates provided to the State Bar were reprinted pages to replace previously existing
pages containing reconciliation notes was inaccurate. The pages with the whited-out dates
primarily consisted of pages with handwritten reconciliation notes and were not clean copies.

42.
N. Clayton was the attorney with the firm who worked with the firm's staff on the
management and reconciliation ofthe trust account.
43.
In multi-lawyer firms, although one attorney may be designated to oversee
management and reconciliation of the trust account utilized by the firm's attorneys, all attorneys
in the firm who deposit entrusted funds in the trust account remain professionally responsible for
the administration of the trust account in compliance with Rule 1.15 of the Rules of Professional
Conduct.
44.
Defendants J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter were aware
that the State Bar had raised concerns that the reconciliations provided to the State Bar were
prepared in a manner intended to mislead the State Bar. Defendants J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R.
McClanahan, and R. Coulter knew N. Clayton had prepared those documents.
45.
Defendants J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter were aware of
the State Bar's allegation that the firm's trust account was not being timely reconciled and that
the State Bar was making numerous inquiries about the management and reconciliation of the
trust account.

46.
In light of the notice from the State Bar of integrity-based concerns arising from
the materials they knew N. Clayton had compiled and produced to the State Bar, Defendants
J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter should not have continued to rely upon
N. Clayton's representations without substantively verifying the information she was providing
to them.
47.
In light of the notice from the State Bar of the concern that the required trust
account reconciliations were not being timely completed for the firm's trust account and the
numerous State Bar inquiries, Defendants J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter
should not have continued to rely upon the arrangement with N. Clayton to satisfy their
professional responsibility for the administration of the trust account without substantively
verifying that she was managing and reconciling the trust account in compliance with the Rules
of Professional Conduct.
48.
Defendants J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R McClanahan, and R. Coulter took no steps
to ascertain whether the reconciliations required by the Rules of Professional Conduct were
being timely completed for the firm's trust account.

Based upon the consent of Plaintiff and Defendants J. Clayton, R Myrick, R.
McClanahan, and R. Coulter and the foregoing stipulated Findings of Fact, the Hearing Panel
enters the following:

Consent Order of Discipline, 17 DHC 25, as to Defendants
J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, R. Coulter

Page 8 of 12

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.
All the parties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the Panel has
jurisdiction over Defendants 1. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter, and the
subject matter.
2.
Defendants J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter engaged in
conduct constituting grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(2) in that
Defendants J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter violated the Rules of
Professional Conduct in effect at the time of the conduct as follows:
a. By failing to ensure that the required reconciliations ofthe trust account utilized
by Defendants J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter were conducted
timely by the attorney entrusted with that responsibility despite notice that the trust
account was not being timely reconciled, Defendants J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R.
McClanahan, and R. Coulter failed to satisfY their responsibility for timely
reconciliations oftheir trust account in violation of Rule l.15-3(d).
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Conclusions of Law, the stipulations offact
by Defendants J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter, and with the consent of
Defendants J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter, the Hearing Panel hereby
finds by clear, cogent and convincing evidence the following additional
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
The legal profession is entrusted with the privilege of self-regulation. The Bar's
system of self-regulation relies upon attorneys to participate in the process and to provide full
and fair disclosures ofthe pertinent facts.
2.
As described above, certain statements in the May 26, 2017 letter signed by all
Defendants were not accurate. Defendants J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R.
Coulter knew at the time they made the statements in the May 26, 2017 letter that the statements
were material to the issues under investigation by the State Bar. Defendants J. Clayton, R.
Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter relied upon N. Clayton's representations and made no
attempt to substantively verifY the information provided to the State Bar in the May 26, 2017
letter. In light of the notice from the State Bar of integrity-based concerns arising from the
materials they knew N. Clayton had compiled and produced to the State Bar, Defendants
J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter acknowledge that they should not have
continued to rely upon N. Clayton's representations without substantively verifYing the
information she was providing to them. There is no evidence of any dishonest motive on the
part of Defendants 1. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter. However, attorneys
responding to State Bar inquiries need to exercise the care necessary to ensure the information
they provide to the State Bar is accurate.
3.
The State Bar relies upon attorneys to fully and fairly respond to its inquiries. In
this case, however, the State Bar already had knowledge regarding the matters set out in
Consent Order of Discipline, 17 DHC 25, as to Defendants
1. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, R. Coulter

Page 9 of12

Defendants' May 26,2017 letter and was not actually misled by the inaccurate statements made
in the letter.
4.
Defendants acknowledge that once Defendants J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R.
McClanahan, and R. Coulter were aware of the State Bar's allegation that the firm's trust
account was not being timely reconciled and that the State Bar was making numerous inquiries
about the management and reconciliation of the trust account, they should have proactively
ensured their trust account responsibilities were in fact being met through N. Clayton as they had
previously thought. A keystone of the public's trust in the legal profession is the proper
management by attorneys of attorney trust accounts.
5.
Defendants J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter have taken
action to ensure future compliance with their responsibilities for proper administration of any
trust account they utilize.
6.
J. Clayton has arranged for an associate with the law firm to become the firm's
Trust Account Oversight Officer in compliance with Rule 1.15-4 of the Rules of Professional
Conduct. J. Clayton has also retained the services of an accountant familiar with the trust
account requirements in the Rules of Professional Conduct to aid the firm's current bookkeeper
and new Trust Account Oversight Officer with establishing compliant reconciliation procesself.
The bookkeeper who J. Clayton discovered had interfered with his receipt of State Bar mail is no
longer working for the firm.
7.
R. Coulter has opened his own law office and now has two separate trust accounts
he maintains, one for real estate transactions and another for other entrusted funds. R. Coulter is
directly and personally involved in ensuring compliance with all trust account requirements. R.
Coulter has also taken the following voluntary proactive actions to assist with and ensure
compliance: he has installed software specifically designed for attorney trust accounts and
particularly real estate practices, and he has retained the services of a trust account management
company that integrates with his software and online banking information to provide him with
daily two~way reconciliations, detailed monthly three-way reconciliations with statements, and
daily alerts for any activity he did not initiate.

practicing between 38 - 48 years and have established reputations for good character.

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearing Panel considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code lB.Ol16(f)(1), (2) and (3) of the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar. The Hearing

Page 10 ofl2

Panel concludes that there are no factors under ยง IB.0116(f)(1) or (2) applicable Defendants
J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter. The Hearing Panel concludes that the
following factors under .0116(f)(3) are applicable:
27 N.C. Admin. Code lB.0116(f)(3)
a.

Factor (A), No history of prior disciplinary offenses;

b.

Factor (C), Absence of selfish motive;
Factor (J), Interim rehabilitation;

c.

Factor (K), Full and free disclosure to the hearing panel and:1 cooperative
attitude toward the proceedings;

d.

Factor (Q), Excellent character reputation; and

e.

Factor (S), Substantial degree of experience in the practice of law.

2.
Defendants' continued reliance upon N. Clayton under circumstances indicating
they should have taken proactive steps to ensure proper fulfillment of their responsibilities posed
potential harm to the profession with respect to statements made to the State Bar, and potential
harm to clients with respect to the management of the firm's trust account.
3.
The Hearing Panel considered all of the disciplinary options available to it. In
light of all of the evidence, the Hearing Panel concluded a reprimand is the appropriate discipline
to be issued to J. Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter.
4.
The Hearing Panel considered all lesser sanctions and concluded that discipline
short of a reprimand would not adequately protect the public. Imposition of a lesser discipline
would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Defendants committed and would send
the wrong message to members of the Bar and the public regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar of this State.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and additional Findings of
Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, and with the consent of Defendants 1.
Clayton, R. Myrick, R. McClanahan, and R. Coulter, the Hearing Panel hereby enters the
