1l. On 23 August 1996, a,fter Defendant knew he no longer represented
her, Defendant negotiated with Harvey by telephone conference and orally agreed
to receive a settl¢.ment draft from Al1stat~ in favor of C~pp~rin the amount of
$12,000.,00. Def~:pdant did not infow llaryey at any til}1e that he had been
discharged oyCapps.
11. Pursuant to th~ tyl~phone conference with Barvey, Defendailt
r~ceived :a draft from Allstate~ numbered 86610491, dated 23 August 1996 and
made payable to "Brenda Capps. and Douglas S. Harris Atty." in the aIllPunt of
- $12,000.00 as the full and fmal settlement proceeds of Capp~' clailll on 23 Augu.st
1996 or shortly thereafter. The draft was accompanied 'by an Allstate document
-entitled "Release of All Claims" intenqed for execution by Cap:gs. Defendant did
npt info~ the insur~c~ company after receipt of the.djaft and release that he had
been di~c'ha,rged by Capps. Def~,mdant k~pt the draft and rele~se at his office &no. ..
did not r~tI,un them to Allstate. _
-

I

13. The Defendant recejved the Allstate draft and release as.a fiduciary.
, ~ Allstate considered Defendant responsible for ov~r.$eei11g th¢ proper execution of
. the release and proper endorsernent of the draft before presenting the draft for
paym¢nt ~t any bank aild I?efendant held them in trust for that purpose.
•

14" D~fendant stat~$ that Capps met with him at his office on Saturday, 18
January 1997 and executed the "R~lease of All Claims" and a,Jlthorized acceptance
of the settlement from Allstate andd~PQsjt of the draft. Upon "acceptance of the
settlement from Allstate repres~nted by the $12,OQO dratt, Capps was -entitled to
receive $8,900·.00 as her net proceeds from the $12,000 Allstate draft after
deducting; the 25% contingency fee to Defendant and reimbw-sement ·of a $100
advl\11c/l of exp!mses by Def!mQant

I

15. ' Defendant~tates that he tpen iSSllt(d a ch~9k from his operating
accoWlt W Capps in the amount of $8~900 and delivered it to her personally at that
time. At no time did Capp& authori~e Defenqant to receive, use, or borrow any of
her net proceeds from this settlement draft for any personal or business expeJ;lses or
use of the Defendant..
.

.

16.. On Tuesday, 21 January 1997, Defendant deposited the Allstate
$12,000.00 settlement draft for Capps' 'cl&im into his oper~ting account, rather than
his trust account. Defendant states he did so because that waS the account from
which he contends
that he issued the $8,900 check to C~pps.
,
17.

As of the be.ginning of the bankillg day on 21 January 1997,
Def~ndantlhad at least tWenty-four (24) checks drawn on his CCB operating

18. The outstanding checks as of the beghuring of the banking day on ~1
January 1997 were presented against Defendant'~ CCB operating account and paid
in due course.

insufficient funds, in Defendant's operating account, including the $~,500 line of, ,
credit on that account, to pay all of Defendant's outstanding check~ ()n the accolillt
and $8,900.00 to Capps. .
,
.
.

19.

Between 21 January 1997 and 20 May 1997, the account balance in '
Defendant's CCB operating a~count remained below $8,900 at all times and '
'Defendant could not have paid Capps $8,900 from this (lccount without drawing on ' '
Defendant's personal line of credit on that account or transferring funds from other
accounts of Defendant to the operating account.
. ,
"
20.

All or part of the $8,900 net proceeds of the Allstate check to which'
Capps was entitled and to which the Defendantwas not .entitledwere used oli or
after 21 January 1997 to pay the, outstanding checks drawn oli Defendant's' "
operating account for the Defendant's personal or business obligations in due" .

21.

No check or other instrument payable to Capps drawn on, Defend@es
CCB operating account, or any other account of the Defendant's, in the amount of
$8,900.00 was ever presented to or paid by Defendant's baDk.
22.

Defendant did not forward the "Release of All Claims" to Allstate on
2l January 1997 or shortly thereafter, nor did Defendant inform Allstate that the
settlement had been completed at that time.
23.

On 6 March 1997, Snow wrote a, letter to Harvey wanting to tevi¢w
the settlement package previously submitted by Defendant in antidpation of
Snow's n,egotiationswith Allstate. Upon receipt of this letter, Harvey contacted
Defendant and asked what had happened to the settlement draft that had beeil
issued In August of 1996.
24.

Defendant informed Harvey that the prior settlement with Capps had
been accepted, the settlement check cashed, and Capps had sign~d the "Release of,
All Claims." Defendant forwarded the signed, original "Release o,f All Claims" to

I

b. A pattern of misoonduct in this matter;

,

d. Substantial experience in the pra~tice of law.

the aggravatirig factors:
