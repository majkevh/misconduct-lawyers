17. The' Defendants contacted at randol1'\ by t~lephone a numbe,r of
attorneys,practicing in High Point, Greensboro, Lexington,
.
Asheboro, Thomas~ille and Burlington. They personally contacted
many other attorneys practicing within the area wpere Def'endaht$
practice. The purpose of these contacts was to, determine· the '
fees being 'charged by the attorneys contacted. ,William G.
Causey, Jr. knew from personal ass06±.ation the f~i§s being chcu;:-ged
by two 'la:w firms practicing in the $ame area. '."
18. The letters' to Ms. Kirkman and' Mr. Bridges a~so stated "We-:
know that you will find THE LE~AL ALTERNAT~VE to be the
afford~ble alternative'for all your legal needs".

I

19. At the t.i,me tl1e letters were sent to Ms. Kirkman ,and Mr.
Bl;,idges, the Def.endants did not ~now the financ;ial condition of ' Ms. Kirkm~n and Mr. Bridges. In Mal;ch of 1991,' Ms • Kirkman,
" . '~ .. ' ,
,"although 'unemployed and a' recipient of Social Security disability
benefits, was the benefic;iary of a sizable estate. In Apri;I of
1991, Mr. Bl;idges was an unemployed alcoholic.
20. The Defendants 'deleted the language, "We a:t:"e sure that you

a sample targeted mailing letter for its review. The N.C. state
, Bar :r-eviewed, but gave no formal approval to, the sa,mple targe·ted
mailing letter which contained the la,nguage complained about by .' ,
the N.C. State Bar:in its disciplinary bomplaint filed in 199~.
It appears that the N. C. State' Bar did not find the sample letter
objectionable at that time.
22. The Defedants sent targeted mail solicita,tion letters to
other people in an attempt to solicit them to engage,their
professional services. All of the Defendants benefited from the
targeted mail solicitations as they were, retained by some
recipients of the 'letters.

I

23. The N.C. State Bar did not prove facts by clear,·cOgent, and
conv;incingevidence to support the violations alleged in
paragraphs (c) anci (d) of its complaint.
BASED upon the fOrE~going Fihding$ of fact; the hearing
committee makes the following:
.
