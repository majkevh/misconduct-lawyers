)

On April 14, 1994, the Grievance Committee of the North
Carolina State Bar met and considered the grievances filed
against you ,by Rosemary Donaldson and Frank Long.
Pursuant to section 13 (A) of article IX of the Rules and
Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar, ,the Grievance
Committee conducted' a preliminary hearihg".
After considering the
information available, to it, including your response to the
letter of notice, the Grievance Committee found probable cause.
Probable cause is d,efined in the rules as II reasonable cause to
believe that a member of the North Carolina S'tate Bar is guilty
of misconduc;t ju~tifying disciplinary action. it
The rules provide that after a finding of probable cause,
the Grievance Committee may determine that the filing of a
complaint and a hearing before the Disciplinary'Hearing
Commission a;re not required and the Grievance Committee ,may issue
various levels of di~cipline depending upon the misconduct, the
,actual or pot.ential injury caused, and any aggravating or
mitigating factors.
The Grievance Committee may issue an
admonition, ,reprimand,' or censure to the respondent attorney.

.1

A reprimand is a written form of discipline more serious
than a:p admonition i'ssued in cases in which an attorney has
violated ,one or more provisions of the RuJ-es of Professional
Conduct and has caused harm or potential harm to a client; the
administration of justice, the profession, or a 'member of the
public; but ;the misconduct does not require a censure.
The Gri:evanCe Commit,tee was of the opinion that a censure is
not requireQ in this case and issues this reprimand to you.
As
chairman of 'the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State
Bar, it is now my duty to issue this reprimand and I am certain
that you will understand fully the spirit in Which this duty is
performed.

inqu.:j.ries from Long about, the matter.
Moreover, you failed to
pay the 1992 ta,xes on'the pl;'operty and failed to record the d~ed,
until April 1,993. Your conduct in this, matter violated Rule
6 (13) (3) ~ which requires attorneys to handle legal matters which
they undertake with l;'easonable diligence.
'
Of equal conGern to the Grievance Committee was your faihi're'
to respond prompt,ly to the, 27A .Judicial pistrict Griev?nce
Committee and to the N.C. State Bar 'regarding Long's grievance.
Although you were notified of thegr;i.evande by the local
"
committee on Feb. 25, 1993, and received a remind~r letter on
April 20, 1993, you made no response whatever to the local
committee. .The N.C.' State Bar's letter of not:i;ce sent to YOll :i;n
July 1993 was returned undeliverecl.
It wa's not until November
:1,993, after yoU' were' served with the letter of notice by the:
sheriff's department,
that you . responded to the ~rievance.

'

Similarly, you were contacted by the 27A Judicial Oistri.a·t
Grievance Committee on Nov~ 17, 1992 and asked to respond to the

not re~pond to the Nov. 17, 1992 letter or a follow up letter
sent to you on April 6, ',1993 by the local committee.
The' N. C;
St9,te Bar"sJuly letter of not;i..ce also went unanswered. Aga:i;nl
it was not until November 1993, wh,en you were subpoenaed to
appear in Raleigh, that you filed a response t'o the Donaldson
grievance.
Rule i.1 (B) of the Rules of Professional Condu'ct req\J,ires

au.thority.
You violated this rule by failing to respond promp'tly
,to the 27A Judicial District Grievance Committ;.eeanc;l to the N.C.

have been previously disciplined for similar misconduct.

trusts that you will heed this reprimand, that it will be ,
remembered by yqu, that it will pe beneficial to you, anc;l tha,t
