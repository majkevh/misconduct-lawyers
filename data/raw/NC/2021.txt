account ~t Wachovia Bank a check in the amount of $2,000 made payable to SDHP and

contributions, 'the Defen4ant nevertheless owed a fiduciary obligation to the EqUIty
partners at SDHP which included an obligation to account to SDHP for any .such funds
received, and. an obligation not to use SDHP funds for purposes other than for the
business of SDHP. The Defendant violated those fiduciary obligations by appropriating
