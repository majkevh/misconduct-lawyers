liability claim by negotiating a settlement between Aleong and the opposing party's insurance

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the panel enters the following
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.
All parties are properly before the hearing panel and the panel has jurisdiction
over Defendant, Roydera D. Hackworth, and over the subject matter ofthis proceeding.
2.
Defendant's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes grounds
for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(2) as follows:
a. By representing Aleong in a personal injury liability claim arising out of a car
accident in Alabama,. Hackworth engaged in the unauthorized practice of law
in violation of Rule 5.5(a);
b. By holding herself out as a licensed attorney and by continuing to represent
Aleong in his personal injury liability claim after being suspended from the
practice of law, Hackworth engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in
violation of Rules 5.5(a) and 5.5(b)(2);
c. By portraying herself to the opposing party's insurance company as a licensed
attorney able to represent Aleong in his personal injury liability claim through
resolution of the liability claim, Hackworth engaged in conduct involving
dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c); and
d. By falsely claiming in her response to the State Bar's Letter of Notice that she
had contacted the Alabama State Bar and confirmed her ability to represent
Aleong in his personal injury liability claim in Alabama, Hackworth made a
false statement of material fact in connection with a disciplinary matter in

violation of Rule 8.l(a) and engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,
deceit, or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c).
Based upon the consent of the parties, the hearing panel also finds by clear, cogent, and
convincing evidence the following

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
Defendant was previously suspended pursuant to the Order of Discipline issued
by the Disciplinary Hearing Commission in case no. 12 DHC 3 dated 22 June 2012. The basis
for discipline in the 2012 Order of Discipline consisted of mismanagement of entrusted funds.
The 2012 Order of Discipline suspended Defendant for four years, with Defendant being allowed
to apply for a stay of the remaining portion of the suspension after one year. Defendant has not
yet applied for a stay of the suspension imposed by the Order of Discipline in case no. 12 DHC
3.
2.
Defendant's client in the present case - Clint Aleong - is Defendant's nephew.
Defendant undertook the representation primarily to assist a family member and Defendant did
not receive any type of payment for the services she provided to Aleong. Although Defendant's
actions violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Defendant did not have a selfish or dishonest
motive in undertaking the representation.
3.
Defendant misrepresented her professional status when she held herself out to the
insurance company as able to provide legal services in Aleong's personal injury liability claim.
4.
Defendant made a misrepresentation to the North Carolina State Bar when she
indicated that she sought and received the Alabama State Bar's approval of her representation of
Aleong.
5.
Defendant's conduct caused potential significant harm to Aleong as well as the
insurance company and other parties involved in the car accident by engaging in and facilitating
settlement negotiations that were improper and potentially ineffectual because she was not an
attorney licensed to practice law in Alabama or any other jurisdiction subsequent to the effective
date of the Order of Discipline in case no. 12 DHC 3.
6.
Defendant's conduct in the present action demonstrates Defendant's continued
disregard for and lack of respect for the Rules of Professional Conduct and the orders issued by
the Disciplinary Hearing Commission. Such disregard interferes with the State Bar's ability to
regulate its members and protect the public. Moreover, it undermines the profession's privilege
to remain self-regulating.
7.
Defendant's conduct caused potential significant harm to the standing ofthe legal
profession in the eyes of the public in that such conduct by attorneys erodes the trust of the
public in the profession. Such erosion of public confidence in attorneys tends to sully the
reputation of, and fosters disrespect for, the profession as a whole. Confidence in the legal
profession is a building block for public trust in the entire legal system.

8.
Defendant, who was licensed to practice law in North Carolina in 1997, has
substantial experience in the practice oflaw.
Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel also enters the following
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of discipline
available to it. In addition, the hearing panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C. Admin. Code 1B ยง .0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and determines the following factors are applicable:

a. Defendant's prior disciplinary offenses in North Carolina;
b. Defendant's lack of a dishonest or selfish motive regarding her representation of
Aleong;
c. Defendant's submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive
practices during the disciplinary process; and
d. Defendant's substantial experience in the practice oflaw.
2.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C. Admin. Code lB ยง .0114(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes that although acts ofdishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication are
present in this case, disbarment is not necessary in order to protect the public.
3.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C. Admin. Code lB ยง .0114(w)(I) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and determines the following factors warrant suspension of Defendant's license:
a. Circumstances reflecting Defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness, or
integrity;
b. Defendant's actions potentially had a negative impact on the public's perception
ofthe legal profession;
c. Defendant's conduct had a potential adverse affect on third parties; and
d. Defendant's conduct included acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or
fabrication.
4.
The hearing panel has considered all other forms of discipline and concludes that
any sanction less than suspension would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses
committed by Defendant, would not adequately protect the public, and would send the wrong
message to attorneys and to the public regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar.

5.
Due to the misrepresentations described in the present action as well as the
significant potential harm resulting from Defendant's conduct, the hearing panel concludes that
active suspension of Defendant's license for a significant and set period of time is the only
discipline that will adequately protect the public from future transgressions by Defendant, that
acknowledges the seriousness of the offenses Defendant committed, and that sends a proper
message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar of
this State. Such active suspension should run concurrently with the active suspension presently
imposed by the Order of Discipline in case no. 12 DHC 3.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and the Findings and
Conclusions Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel enters the following

1.

years. This Order shall be effective upon filing, and the suspension shall run concurrently with
the terms of the suspension imposed by the Order of Discipline in case no. 12 DHC 3.
