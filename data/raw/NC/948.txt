By allowing the company of which he was named the president to recite in the

Page 9 of1S

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and the consent of the
parties, the Hearing Panel hereby makes by clear, cogent and convincing evidence the following;
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
Defendant was not aware at the time that the individuals refen'ed to herein were
clients of LHG. The only client with whom he had any contact was "S.M." Defendant was not
aware of LHG' s interactions with the other clients referred to herein nOT the extent of the harm
they incurred nntil this action was commenced.
2.
Defendant has fully cooperated with the State Bar's investigation into the
company's activities in NOlih Carolina and other states.
3.
Defendant has acknowledged his conduct violated the Rules of Professional
Conduct from the outset of the State Bar's investigation in this matter. l1noughout the
investigation of' the grievance and in these proceedings before the DHC, Defendant has been
particularly candid ,md fOliln'ight in his responses and in his admissions of' wrongdoing and
violations of the Rules of' Professional Conduct. Defendant has demonstrated genuine remorse
throughout the process.
4.
There is no evidence that Defendaut intended to harm his clients
exhibited a dishonest or selfish motive.
5.

01'

that he

Defendant has no prior discipline in his nearly fifteen years of practice in tlnee

states.
6.
Based upon Defendant's lack of discipline in nearly fifteen years of practice, his
candid admissions tlnoughout these proceedings, his remorse and efforts to rectify the effects on
his clients, and his experience in the practice of law, there is little likelihood of repetition of this
misconduct.
7.
While Defendant nominally SClved as the president and owner ofLHG tlnoughout
the corporation's existence and executed a "declaration" on August 19, 2014 wherein he stated
that he "was personally responsible for representing Legal Help Group's clients in tlle state of
North Carolina," these representations overstate Defendaot's involvementยท with LHG. In
substance and practice, though not in name, the beneficial owner and director of LHG was
Phillips. Defendant signed and executed various documents at the direction of Phillips that made
it appeal' Defendant was the owner of LHG. However, Defendant believed he was merely a
minority partner with Phillips. Phillips received the majority of the financial profits made by
LHG; made all decisions regarding the direction and actions of the company; supervised the dayto-day operations ofLHG; andhircd, fired, and supervised all ofLHG's employees.
8.
In instances where clients who paid LHG for legal services contacted Defendant
personally and made him aware of their damages, Defendant promptly aod fully ref,mded the
clients' money. l1lese efforts to rectify were taken plior to the State Bar's investigation into
Defendant.
Page 10 of15

9.
Defendant was unaware that Phillips had incOlporated LHO and named Defendant
as the president and sole owner of LHO lmtil Phillips presented him with the "declaration" on
August 19, 2014.
10.
Defendant was lillaware of the harm LHO was causing to members of the public;
as soon as he was informed of the harm LHO was causing, Defendant immediately took steps to
disassociate with LHO and mitigate the damages suffered by the victims ofLHO about whom he
was aware.
Based upon the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the Additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, and with the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel
makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REOARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code 1B ยง .0114(w)(I) and concludes that the following factor that warrants suspension or
disbm'ment is present:
(a) Negative impact of defendant's actions on clicnt's or public's perception of the
profession.
2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code 1B ยง .0114(w)(2) and concludes that no factors that warrant disbarment m'e present.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code IB ยง .0114(w)(3) and concludes that the following m'e applicable in this matter:
(a) Absence of dishonest or selfish motive;
(b) Multiple offenses;
(c) Defendant's full and free disclosure to the heming panel and cooperative attitude
toward the procecdings; and
(d) Defendant's remorse.
4.
Defendant has caused harm to his clients by aiding in the mmuthorized practice of
law and debt adjusting.
5.
The Hearing Panel has considered all lesser sanctions including: censure,
reprimand and admonition, and finds that discipline less than suspension would not adequately
protect the public from Defendant's future misconduct because of the gravity of potential
significant harm to his clients.

Page 11 oftS

6.
Under other circumstances, the misconduct in this case would wan'ant more
serious discipline. The misconduct caused substantial ham] to the clients of LHG and potential
hmm to the public's confidence in the integrity of the legal profession. However, the Hearing
Panel concludes that the public will be adequately protected by the discipline imposed given the
specific circnmstances of this case, including the lack of evidence that Defendant intentionally
hmmed the clients, Defendmt's lack of professional discipline, Defendant's favorable
professional and personal reputation in the community, Defendant's candid acceptance of
personal responsibility for his actions from the outset of the State Bar's investigation,
Defendmt's acknowledgement of the wrongfl.llness and seriousness of his misconduct,
Defendant's lack of control over LHG, Defendant's effolis to rectify the harm caused by LHG,
Defendant's lack of awm'eness of the harm caused by LHG, and Defendant's genuine remorse.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Additional Findings of
Fact Regmding Discipline and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, and on the consent of
the pmiies, the Heming Panel enters the following:
