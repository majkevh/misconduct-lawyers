the existence of Oak Hollow's obligation to the Laws at any time
prior to the bank advancing funds in relianc'e on tpe loan
application and the financial statement.

11. None of the $132,500.00 advanced on the lOan by the.
bank was paid to the Laws as part of the purcha~e.pr~ce of Laws

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The conduct of the Defendant, as set out above, constitutes
grounds for disc' l'
ursuant to N.C. Gen. Sta·te. Sec. 8428(b)(2) ~n that~be~~~d~nt's conduct violates the N. C. Rules of
Professio~al Conduct as follows~
(a)

~By

(b)

By advising the bank's representatives that $132,500.00
9f the loan proceedS were to be used to purchase the
Laws Farm property when it was not, by failing to
~dvise the bank's representatives about the transaction
that Oak Hollow had already entered into with the Laws
for purchase of the Laws Farm property, and by failing
to advise the bank's representatives about the
p'romissory note that had been entered into with the
Laws prior to the bank advancing the $132,500.00 on the
loan, Maggiolo engaged in conduct involving dishonesty,
fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation in violation of .
Rule 1!2(C); and knowingly made a false statement of
fact in violation of Rule 7.2(A) (4).

(c)

By advising Darst to create back-dated promissory notes
to give to the commission's' investigator with the
intent to deceive the investigator, Maggiolo counseled
or assisted a client in conduct he knew was fraudulent
in violation of RUle 7.1 (A) (4)' and 7.2 (A) (8) and
participated in the creation of evidence when he knew
the evidence was false in violation of Rule 7.2(A) (6).

•

reading the Sales ~greement to the Laws and
;answering their quest~ons about the document, and by
advising the Laws to sign the Sales Agr.eement, the
promissory note and the deed he had prepared for them
to sign at the August 11, 1989 closing wit~out advising
~he Laws to seek independent counsel, Magg10lo gave
advice to a person who was not represented by counsel,
other than the advice to seek counsel, when the
interest of that person w7re in conflict wi~h t~e
.
interest of Haggiolo's cl1ent, Oak Hollow, 1n v1olat10~
Of Rule 7.4(B).

The hearing cOlnmittee did not find any of the other
violations bf the Rules of Professional Conduct alleged in the
Complaint.

•

The hearing committee believes that Rule 5.1(B) required
Maggiolo to obtain consent after full di~closure from the
purchasers ·of Oak H~llow property for whom he did 'closings before
being able to conduct such clo~ings, which he did not do.
However, since as a result of CP~ 254 and subsequent RPC 83,
Maggiolo may have reasonably bel1eved he was complying with Rule
5.1(B) by h~ving ot~er counsel d,? the ~itle searches, the hearing
committee d1d not f1nd that Magg1olo v10lated Rule 5.1(B) •
