Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and upon the
evidence and arguments presented at the hearing concerning appropriate discipline, the
hearing panel hereby finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
Pierce's conduct - to wit: widespread and severe neglect of client matters,
failure to adequately communicate with his clients, failure to resolve the matters for which
he was retained, and repeated misrepresentations to his clients regarding the true status of
his clients' legal matters - caused significant harm to his clients by impairing his clients'
ability to achieve the goals of the representation and by subjecting his clients to unwanted
consequences that were detrimental to their personal and professional lives. The
consequences experienced by Pierce's clients included alTest wanants issued and executed
due to Pierce's failure to appear in court, default judgments entered against clients for
Pierce's failure to file an answer or participate in any way in his clients' respective civil
matters, damaged credit, bankruptcy, lost paid legal fees, enormous frustration and stress.
?
Pierce's conduct caused significant harm to the public and the
administration of justice by lllmecessarily delaying resolution of his clients' pending cases
and subjecting the cases to procedural resolution, rather than substantive or merit-based

13

resolution. Justice is achieved when all matters subjected to litigation are resolved on their
merits and not by default or as a result of procedural problems such as those created by
Pierce. Pierce's conduct not only hanned his clients' ability to resolve their respective
legal matters, but also demonstrated an ongoing pattern of neglectful conduct.
3.
Pierce's conduct caused significant hann to the profession. Pierce's
neglect, failure to communicate with clients, failure to resolve the matters for which he was
retained, and repeated misrepresentations regarding the true status of his clients' legal
matters caused his clients, who were vulnerable to the extent that they were unfamiliar
with the legal process and relied upon Pierce to protect their legal rights, to feel their trust
had been betrayed. Several of Pierce's fonner clients expressed a sense of distrust of the
legal profession in general due to Pierce's conduct.
4.
Pierce's habitual neglect of his clients' matters has the potential to cause
significant harm to the standing of the legal profession in the eyes of the public because it
shows his disregard for his duties as an attorney. Such erosion of public confidence in
attomeys tends to sully the reputation of, and fosters disrespect for, the profession as a
whole. Confidence in the legal profession is a building block for public trust in the entire
legal system.
5.
Pierce's continued failure to respond to inquiries from the State Bar
demonstrates a refusal to paIiicipate in the self-regulation process. Such conduct interferes
with the State Bar's ability to regulate its members aI1d undennines the profession's
privilege to remain self-regulating.
6.
Pierce's conduct demonstrates an intentional aI1d sometimes impulsive
pattern of misrepresentations to his clients concerning the true status of their respective
legal matters, aI1d Pierce never made any attempt to conect the misrepresentations and/or
fabrications he delivered to his clients concerning their respective legal matters.
7.
Pierce has previously been disciplined by the Grievance Committee of the
North Carolina State Bar as well as this Commission for neglecting multiple clients' legal
matters aI1d repeatedly failing to respond to the State Bar's inquiries during the fee dispute
aI1d grievance processes. Pierce's prior discipline concerning conduct similar to that
contained in the present Order consists of the following:
(a)

a 2005 Admonition in grievaI1ce file no. 04G0987;

(b)

a 2006 stayed suspension in DHC case no. 05 DHC 42 which was
activated in January 2009 for Defendant's failure to comply with the
conditions of the stayed suspension; aI1d

(c)

a 2009 active suspension in DHC case no. 08 DHC 3

Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, aI1d Additional Findings
RegaI'ding Discipline, the hearing paI1el also enters the following

14

CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the hearing panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง .OI14(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and finds the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a)

Prior disciplinary offenses in this state;

(b)

A pattern of misconduct;

(c)

Multiple offenses; and

(d)

Vulnerability of the victims, to wit: Defendant's clients named in the
present complaint.

?
The hearing panel has also carefully considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง .01l4(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and finds Defendant has engaged in the following conduct that compel
consideration of and wa.nant disbarment of Defendant's license:

(a)

Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication; and

(b)

Impulsive acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication
without timely remedial efforts.

3.
The hearing panel has also carefully considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง .OI14(w)(l) of the Rules and Regulations of the NOlih
Carolina State Bar and finds the following factors warrant disbarment of Defendant's
license:
(a)

Circumstances reflecting the defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness,
or integrity;

(b)

Negative impact of Defendant's actions on his clients' or the public's
perception of the profession;

(c)

Negative impact of Defendant's actions on the administration ofjustice;

(d)

Impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the
representation;

(e)

Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication; and

(f)

Multiple instances of failure to participate in the legal profession's selfregulation process.

4.
The hearing panel has considered all other fornls of discipline and
concludes that any sanction less than disbarment would fail to acknowledge the
15

seriousness of the offenses committed by Defendant, would not adequately protect clients,
the public, the administration of justice and the profession, and would send the wrong
message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar.
5.
Due to the nature and extent of Defendant's conduct, the significant harm
caused by Defendant's conduct, and Defendant's extensive prior discipline for similar
misconduct, and in the interest of protecting clients, the public, the administration of
justice and the profession, this panel finds and concludes that disbannent is the only
discipline that will adequately protect clients, the public, the administration of justice, and
the profession from future transgressions by Defendant.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Findings and
Conclusions Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel enters the following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
I.

State of North Carolina effective immediately.

neccssary.
