. At its regular quar:te'rly meeting on July 14, 1988, the Grievance
Comrtli·ttee of the t:lorth Oarolina State Bar conducted a preliminary hearing
under Section 13 of Article IX of the Rules and Regulations.of the the North'
Carolina State Bar. regarding the grievance filed against you by Thelma P.
Tennin. The committee c'onsidered all of the evidence before it, including
'your/written statement to the'-committee. Purs,uant to Section 13(10) of the
rule~, the committee fotind probable cause. Probabl~ cause is defined under
the rules as: "A finding by the Orievance Committee that th~re is reasonable
cause:to believe that a'member of the North Carolina State Bar is guilty of
misco'nduct justifying disciplinary action ... , The committee determined that a
complaint and a hearing.were not warranted in this matter and the committee
ordered a Public'Censure upon your acceptance of it. Therefore, the committee
.issues this Public Censure to you.
As Chairman of 'the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar,
it is now my duty to issue this Public Censure and, I am certain that you
understand fully the spirit in which thi's duty is performed, 'that you .will
understand the censure, 'and appreciate its significance. The fact that a
Public Censure ~s not the most serious discipline that may be imposed by the
North Carolina State Bar, should not be taken by you to indic;:ate that <'my
member of the committee feels that your conduct was excusable or less than a
serious and substantial violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.
