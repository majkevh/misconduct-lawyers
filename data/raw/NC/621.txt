duress. I am fully aware of the implications of submitting my resignation.
3. I am aware that there is a pending investigation by the State Bar regarding
allegations that I misappropriated at least $770,500.00 from my attorney trust account that
had been entrusted to me in a fiduciary capacity, at least $70,000.00 of which I utilized for
my own benefit without authorization from the beneficial owners of the funds.
4. I acknowledge that the material facts upon which the investigation is predicated are
true.

predicated upon the misconduct under investigation, I could not successfully defend against
them.
