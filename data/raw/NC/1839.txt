On or about May 29, 1990, Mr. Brent Thompson hired Miller to represent ltim

I

Thompson's claim was set for hearing on October 5, 1992. Pursuant to a.
pre-trial order filed August 25, 1992, Miller was required to initiate preparation

, of the pre-trial .agreement and forward it to defendant's counsel. The pre-trial
order stated that Millet's failure to timely comply with this requirement could
result in .the imposition of sanctions, including removal of Thompson's case from
the hearing docket.

Miller failed to initiate preparation or the pre-trial agreement as required by the
pre-trial order. Therefore, by order filed September 25, 1992, Thompson's case
was removed from the docket and his request for hearing was treated as though it

, was withdrawn.
15.

,Throughout Miller's representation of Thompson, Miller failed to reasonably
, cOII11Ilunicate with Thompson concerning the status of his claim.

: reasonably communicate with Thompson concerning the status of his case,
. Thompson discharged Miller. By letter dated September 22, 1993, Thompson
i notified Miller that he had hired another attorney, Ms. Mary V. Carrigan, to
, represent him. However, Miller failed and refused to withdraw .as attorney of

he had recently sent Thompson's file to Ms. Carrigan, Thompson's new attorney.

Miller received the subpoena on May 20, 1994. However, Millet failed and
refused to appear at the State B~r offices on June 3, 1994.
