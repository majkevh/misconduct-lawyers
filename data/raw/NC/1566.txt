On Octpber IS, 1989, the Grievance Cbr\1Lllittee 6~ the North <:a+o+irig. S1:ate
Bar met and considere1 the; grievance fil~ against YOll by Mar$a11 E. Sprague.

Pursuant to Section 13 (7) of Article IX of tlle; RuleS a:hd.~ati6hs: ot
the North carolina State Bar, the Grie~ce Committee, a~· conSidering the
evidence, inclll~ your response to the letter of Notice, found probable
cause which is deflIie1 in the rules as "reasonable cause to believe that a
ll'IeI!1ber of the North Cc1r9lina State !3aI is gtti,lty of 'miscond,uctjllStifying .
disciplinary action."
' . '

I

The :ruleS provide that after a finding of probable cause; the Grieyqnee
Committee may detennine that the filing of a COIl'plaint and a h~ing.before·
.the bisciplinary Heari.rq COrnrnission are -not ~equired and the Grie\$ice
Committee may issue varl.OUS level$ ot. diseipline depeildingupon the .
mj"scopduct, the actual or potential injl.lrY caused, and any aggrava:t.~ OJ; '.
miti;Jating factors. T.l)e Grievance Committee may issue a Private Repr~, a
PubIl.C Repr:i.Inan<;l, or a Public CehSUre to the acCuse::i 'attorney.
The GrievanceCOrnrnittee was of t:he opinion that· a CClmpl~int and' hearing
are not required in t:l1is case and issueS thi$. Pllblic Rep:r~ to YO\l.. AS
cnainnan of the Grievance Committee of the North carolina sta~ l3a:t, it i$ now
. my duty to issue this Pqblic RepriInand and .r am. certa:in that yo~ will
unders"tarlCj fully the spirit in which this duty is ~dItneid~
.
A Public Reprimand is a serious fo:qn of discipline ~ py the .
Grievance Committee. The Grievance committee felt that· YOur eqndUct· ~ted
puplic dj.scipline due to your violation of the RUles of Prof$S$ionaJ; COI1Cillct.
The committee trusts that this mi$COnduct will not recUr.
. ..

I

You represen~ the COIr!Plainan~, ~IE. $pragUe, in his . purd'lase of
three propertieS from Jerome Weber atUmted. stateS Fidelity and Guaratlty
COmpany., These three propertieS were c;;:losed by your offi¢e on Allgtl$t 3C)",'
September 5, and Sep~ 14, 1984. ::tnyour ;-esponse to the Grievan~,
Committee, you admitted that you did not conduct forma;L c:tos~s in ·t;llese.
three property transactions •. Instead, a former pa;ralega1, Jerl. Kane, ~t wi,th
Mr. Sprague ~ witneSsed Mr. Sprague' ssigning of W~ affidavits of
'
occupancy of t:he propertieS. In these affidavits" Mr~spragt.leat~t$d 1;.hp.t·
h~ would reSide in each of the three properties.
In fact, these affidavits·
.
were falsely made by Mr~' Spr?lgue and he did not occupy orititen<;lto Q9CUPY the
properties as his principal :reSidence. Again, Ms. Kane witnessed two of thE?
mo~gor's affidavits and signed her name to them. Inana.ffidavit·dated,·
September 14, 1984, Ms. Kane indicateS that she signed yOJ,lr name and believeS
she did so upon your requeSt.
.

rue to your lack of invclvement in conducting a f9rmal clos:U:q in these

three transactions, th~ lenders were given falSe affidavits regardihg
Sprague's oc::cupancy of· the property. Indeed., you may argue that Mr. Sprague
had al~dy misrepresented to the lenders that he would reside in these

properties when.hemade application for the loans. However, it is conceiV?lble
that had you actually participated in the formal closings, V?hich occurred
durirq a short time period, you would have detected sOme impropriety in Mr.
Sprague's execution ot these three affidavits·.

1-.

In a residential ioan transaction., a lawyer may ethically represent both
the OOrrc:Mer and the lender. The l~wyer is deemed to represent both parties
unless he disclaims his representation of one or the other parti~. (See CPR
100)· In this real esta'\:e transaction,· yoU had a duty to both Mr. Sprague and
the lenderS. You had an obligation to ensure that no fraudulent documents
were execUted to the lenders anc1'that the lenders' in'b?rests were' protected.
Fort,uha~y, yC?l.l seem tQ. reqognize yo.ur E;\trOr in not participating actively. in
t';he· closings. :rn your dctol:;>e:r 14, l.98.8 respo~ to the lOth JuQicial. District
.GrievanceCamnittee,. yOll. stated -enat "if I bad known that tPe residen~ .
st;a~t had beEm falsely exec:uted, th~ transaction would not have clOSed.'"
.
You should also note that you,r responsibili~ to the parties in a closing
~cannot be ,shifted to your, eitployee~
It is very likely that if you bad been
present at the tllree closlngs, you would have det.e¢:ed the falsely executed
affidavits and So infor.tned the lenders of the problem.

Your conduct in tllis matter violated Rule 5.1(C), Rule 7 .1(A) (1) and (3)
the Rules of ProfesSional Conduct. Also, your apparent authorization of
Ms. 1<ar).e to sign your name to the september 14, 1984 mortgagor's affidavit,
without your being present, violated Rule 3.3 (C) •

ot

You are hereby puQlicly reprimanded by the' North carolina state Bar due

you will never again allow yourself to depart from adherence to the high
ethical standardS of th~ legal profession. 'ihis PUblic Reprimand should Serve
as a strong reminder and inducement fo;r you to weigh carefully in the future
your responsibility to the public, your cl,i~ts" your fellow attorneys
