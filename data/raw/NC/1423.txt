IN THE MATTER OF

ROSBON D. B. WHEDBEE,
ATroRNEY AT LAW
:-

..

PUBLIC CENSURE

At its regular quart~rly m~eting on April 10" 1985" the Grievance
Committee of the North Carolina State Bar 'condUcted a preliminary hearing
under Section 13 of the ~scipline and Disbarment Rules of the North Carolina
State Bar regarding the grievance filed against you by William E. West, Jr.
The Co~ttee considered all of the evidence before it, including your written
statement to the CoIIimittee. Pursuant to Section 13 (10) of the Discipline and'
Disbarment Rules, the Co~ittee found probable cause,. Probable cause is
defined under the Discipline and Disbarment Rules as: "A finding by the
Grievance Committee that ~here is reasonable caUse to believe that a member of
the North Carolina ,State Bar is guilty of miscondUct justifying disciplinary
action." The rules also provide tlu:!;t i f ,after a finding of probable qause,
the Committee detenmines that a complaint and a hearing are not warranted, the
Conmittee may issue a publ;ic censure upon the acceptance of 'the same by the
attorney. That determinat:ion has been made by the Committee and the Committee
issues this• Public Censurejf to you.

I'"

As Chairman o~ the G~ievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar,
it is now my duty to issue; this Public Censure and I am certain that you
understand ,fully the spiri:t in which this duty is p~rformed, that you will
understand the censure, and appreCiate its significance. The fact that a
public censure is not the ~ost serious discipline that may be imposed by the
North Carolina State Bar should not be t~en by you to indicate that any
member of the Co~ittee feels that your conduct was excusable or less than a
serious 'and substantial vi?lation of the Code of Professional Responsibi;Lity .•
I

You have admitteq that you have used your trust account at Tarheel Bank
and Trust Company in Ahosk~e, North Carolina for the deposit of your personal
funds, during the period ,from March, 1984 through January 21, 1985. At least
two Checks were written frpm this trust -account to make personal payments on
your house. Your admitted reason for using, the trust account in this manner
was to avoid an IRS tax li~n that had been placed on your regular business
accounts.
The purpose of a trust account of an attorney is to hold, in trust, those
funds which ,rightfully belong to the attomey i s client
Commingling of a
lawyer's funds in the trust account jeopardizes the client's funds by
potentially subjecting them to the reach of the l~wyer's creditors. That
danger c.arne clsoe to reality in this case. Personal funds of the attorney
