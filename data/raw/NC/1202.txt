FINDINGS OF FACT RELATED TO FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

4.
Dale Underhill ("Underhill") and Darrell Miller ("MiUer")co.owned Showcase
Homes, Iuc. ("Showcase Homes"), which developed property and built residential homes ina
subdivisioli in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
5.
Showcase Homes built a house on one oflhe lots (2450 Meadowpark Lane) in the
subdivision, which Miller and his wife contracted to purchase.
6.
In January 2007, Underhill and Miller entered into an agreement to dissolve their
business relationship in Showcase Homes.
.
7.
On February 16, 2007, Dettmdant and his firm at the time, Stamey & Foust,
served as the settlement agent fotMilIer and his wife in the closing on 2450 Meadowpark Lane.
8.
The HUD-1 and ledger for the closing shows that Defendant issued disbursements
totaling $152,504.23 via niue checks from the Stamey & Foust BB&T (tust account (ending in 2530), including $34,681.16 to Showcase Homes via check no. 109996, but Defendant never
forwarded disbursement check no. 109996 to Showcase Homes.
9.
Underhill contacted Defendant after the closIng on uumerousoccasions to inquire
when he might expect the disbursement check to Showcase Homes, but Defendant never
provided Underhill a definite answer.
10.
Instead, because ofa dispute between Underhill and Miller over their Showcase
Homes dissolution agreement, Defendant held the $34,681.16 that was to be disbursed to the
seller, Showcase Homes, in the Stamey & Foust BB&T ttust account (endingin-2530).
11.
In 2010, Miller brought a civil action against Underhill. Darrell Miller v. Dale
Underhill and Showcase Homes, [nc., No. IO·CVS·5422 (Forsyth Co. Sup. Ct.) ("the Miller
lawsuit") regarding the Showcase Homes dissolution agreement.

Defendant represented Miller in the Miller lawsuit.

13.
Defendant disassociated himself from the Stamey & Foust finn in 2011 and Oil
May 20,2011, Defendant opened his own NewBridge Bank ftust account (ending in .4720) and
operating account (ending in -4739).
14.
Defendant did not immediately transfer the $34,681.16 remaining in the Stamey
& Foust BB&T trust account to his new NewBridge Bauk trust account. Asa result, the
$34,681.16 remained in the Stamey & Foust BB&T trust account for nearly a year and a half
after Detendant had disassociated himself from the Stamey & Foust firm.
15.
An Order and Judgment was entered in the. Miller lawsuit on March 12,2012 by
Supetior Court Judge A. Moses Massey, who tuled that the dissolution agreement previously
entered into by Underhill and Miller was legal and enforceable.

2

16.
Judge Massey ordered that Underhill .and Miller were to receive certain proceeds
and reimbursements under their dissolution agreement, including $20;345.87 to Underhill and
$14,335.31 to Mi1Ier from the $34,681.16 that remained in the Stamey & Foust BB&T trust
ac()Ount.
17.
Underhill and Miller made repeated demands of Defendant for payment Mtheit
sums owed, but Defendant did no! make the disbursements as ordered.

18. In an e;J(change of messages in September and early October of 2012, Defendant
took the position that there were liens for assessments on the property that prevented Underhill
from conveying clear title to Miller and, therefore, Defendant needed to clarify Judge Massey's
Order as to who was responsible for the liens.
19.
011 October 3, 2012, Defendant deposited illto his NewBridge Bank trust account
a check in the.artlount of $34,681.16 from the Stamey & FoustBB&T trust aecomlt, representing
the funds Judge Massey ordered to be disbursed toUlld(lrhHI and Miller.
20.
Because of Defendant's delay in disbursing the $14,335.31 to MiIl(lf P(lf Judge
Massey's order, Miller retained attorney T. Lawson Newton ("Newton") to obtain his
disbursement from Defendant.
21.
Newton initiated conversations with Defendant's office in October of 2012 and
left messages for Defendant to return his telephone calls, but Defendant did not do so,
22.
On December 1,2012, Defendantissued a cheek from his NewBridge Bank trust
account (check no. 14089) in the amount of $14,335.31 to Newton, on behalf of Miller, but
misaddressed or did 110t immediately mail the check to Newton, causing the check not to reach
Newton until on or about February 6, 2013.
23.
The debit to Defendant's NewBridge Bank trust aCColmt for check no. 14089
posted on Febn1ary 7, 2013.
24.

enforce the disbursement ordered by JudgeMassey.
26.

should have remained in Defendant's NewBridge Bank trust accou11t for the benefit ofUnderhlll
pet Judge Massey's Order.
27.
Defendant's NewBridge Bank trust account records showed numerous
Wlattributed payments to Defendrultduring March and April of 2013 that depleted his trust
account balance below what should have been in the trust account to cover the remaining
$20,345.85 held in trust fo1' Underhill.
28.
Defendant's NewBridge Bank trust aCGount records also showed a number of
unidentified andlor unverified withdrawals ili..Novetnber and December 2013 that contributed to
the balance depletion, including the following: (1) Novembei' 6, 2013 in the runount of
$1,756.64; (2) November 15,2013 in the amount of $1,200; (3) Novetnber21, 2013 in the

NOlth Carolina NewBridge Bank branch. This "Miscellaneous Charge" also was not signed by
Defendant, but indicated that it was made to Defelldant. Defendant provided client attribution On

Defendant's trust account records showed that there were no funds in the account
held for or on behalf of"Elizabeth Jordan" in December 2013.
39.
The two disbursements Defendant attributed to "Elizabeth Jordan" in December
of2013 placed her ledger into a $500 negative balance.
40.
As a restilt of unattributed payments to Defendant in March and April of2013 and
the withdrawals by Defendant iii November and December of 2013, the balance of Defendant's

4

Based upon the evidence, the hearing panel also finds by clear, cogent, and convincing
evidence the following

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT CONCERNING DISCIPLINE
I.

Defendant has no record of prior discipline in North Carolina.

2.

Defendant has substantial experience in the practice oflaw.

3.

Defendant's misconduct oGclirred in ¢oruwctiQn with his representation of clients.

4.
Effective February 7,2013, the State Bar adruinis(rativelysuspended Defendant
for failure to comply with his 2012 Continuing Legal EdUC;ltion ("CLE") requirements.
5.
On October 31,2012, Defendant entered into adeferreaprosecutionagreement to
obtain treatment in a rehabilitation program after he was charged with conteml't by a Guilford
County District Court in State v. Michael Stamey. No. 12·CR·.43030 (Guilford Co. Dist. Ct.).
6.
In approximately April or May of 2013, Defendant entered the substance abuse
treatment program pursuant to his deferreG pr6secUtionagreement.
7.
Upon Defc:lIldant's completion of the substance abuse lteatIilent program,
Defendant abandoned his law practice and in approximately June of 2013 his paralegal, Ms.
Renshaw, moved his files to a storage facility in Jamestown, North Carolina.
S.

Defendantrelapsed into substance abuse in October of2013.

money that they incurred in paying the balance owed to th" Guilford County Tax Department.
On March 3, 2014, Kemmerer acknowledged receiving and depositing the funds from
Defendant's father.
12.
Despite notice and the oPPOliunity to do so, Defendant failed to appear or have
legal rcpresentation appear on his behalf at the hearing before this panel, and therefore he
deliberately failed topartiGipate in the self-regulation process.
13.
According to Kemmerer, DetilItdant vioillted his trust by mishandling the funds
which were supposed to pay his tax bill, and the incidellt also caused Kemmerer concern about
