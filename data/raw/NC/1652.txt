d,iscussiens abeut hmw to handl.e their 1986 taxe!:?., Washingten
previded infermatien abeut her inceme te ~mith and/er hi~
,acceuntants.
, ,,9. :Prier to May 15, 1987, Washingten teld ~mith that she
weuld f1le separate.tax returns and that she did net wish te file
any jeint returns fer 1986~
,
10. On .or abeut May 15, 1987, W~shingten, filed separate tax
returns with th~ state .of Mar¥land, the State .of Nerth Carel ina
and the' Internal RevenUe! Serv1ce,. Washingten receivega refund

return with the North Carel ina De~artment .of Reven~e fer 1986.
The return purperted te be a cemb1ned return fer h1mself and
Washingten.
12.' As .of 'June 30, 1988 smith was aware that Washingten had
already filed a separate Nerth Careliha return fer 1986 and that
he did net have her permissien tc;> file a cembined Nerth Carel ina
return.
13. The Plaintiff failed'te ~reve by clear, cegent and

,

14. The cembin~d 198~ tax return filed by Smith indicated

when he filed the return in June, 1988.

, 22.' At the time he' filed th~ joint federal ta~ return for,
1986, smith knew that Washington had already'filed a separate',
federal return for.1986 and that'she did not wish to file. a joint
return for 1986.
..
,
23.. The Plaintiff' failed to demons'trat~by clear,' cogent and
convincing evidence that Smith failed to notify W:asningt,on tha·t'
he, had filed a \ joint federal
return for. 1986. ,~-,~.;...,~-..- '.,

refund owed Washin~ton for her 1989 taxes and applied it to the .
taxes owed by Smith for 1986.

'"
'.
,
25. In November, .i990, following a protest by Washipgton,
the IRS returned to Washington the refund it had seized and
applied to Smith's 1986 tax obli9ation.
26. On o·r about May 19, 1989, a 1986 non-resident ,t?t~ retuli,n'
bearing Smith's signature was filed with the Maryland Depart~ent
of Revenue. The return purported to be a joint filing fo~ Smith
etnd Washington.

31. The Plaintiff fCliled to showpy clear, :<::ogeht, a.nsl.· '-~
convincing evidence that Smith filed the tax retutrt, in 'M~rYland;,
