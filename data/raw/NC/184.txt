AFFIDAVIT OF SURRENDER
OF LAW LICENSE

)

Neil G. O'Rourke, being first duly sworn, deposes and says as follows:
1. I desire to resign and hereby tender my license to practice law in North Carolina

2. My resignation is freely and voluntarily rendered. It is not the result of coercion or duress. I
am fully aware of the implication of submitting my resignation.

3. I am aware that there is pending an investigation regarding allegations that I conspired to
commit loan fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud and securities fraud in violation of 18
U.S.c. 371 in my capacity as officer of Peerless Real Estate Services, LLC. I have been charged
in the Federal District Court for the Western District of North Carolina with one count of
conspiracy to commit loan fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud and securities fraud in
violation of 18 U.S.c. 371. I have entered my plea of guilty to this charge. I am in fact guilty of
this charge.

connection with, a real estate development called "Village of Penland."
5. I acknowledge the truth of the material facts upon which the investigation is predicated.

6. I am submitting my resignation because I believe that is the right thing to do. I know that if
disciplinary charges were predicated upon the misconduct under investigation, I could not
successfully defend against them.
