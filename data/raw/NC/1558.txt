letter

dated April 15, 1985 reguesting information about the four outstanding
checks in Keaton's cases and Defendant did not respond to Porter's
letter.

Al though you apparently failed

to answer

some

interrogatories

submitted to Mrs. Keaton and her case was dismissed, you were able to
have that dismissal reversed by appealing to the full Commission and
the matter was returned for hearing by a hearing officer.

The North

Carolina state Bar did not allege any misconduct in failing to answer
the interrogatories and the Hearing committee did not piace any weight
on this apparent failure.

This does explain to some degree why a

claim.filed in October of 1980 was not heard for over three years by
the Deputy
