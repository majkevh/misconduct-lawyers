FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE

two years, failed to timely disburse funds for clients for over two years, and disbursed
funds for clients when he had no funds 01' insufficient funds for such clients in his tmst
account. Despite the discipline imposed against him in September 2015, Defendant did
not cure this misconduct. From October 2015 through February 2017, Defendant failed
to reconcile his trust account. As of December 2017 he had not completed disbursements
for clients for whom he had held nmds since at least October 2015. Additionally,
Defendant failed to promptly deposit entrusted funds from October 2015 through
December 20 I 7. In at least three instances, he delivered the hust account checks

improper disbursements from the BB&T trust account on three occasions.
2.
In the September 2015 Order of Discipline, the DHC suspended
Defendant for two years and stayed the suspension for three years conditioned upon
compliance with the requirements in the Order. In November 2017, the DRC found
Defendant had failed to comply with the conditions of the September 2015 Order but
gave Defendant another opportunity to comply by extending the stay with additional

conditions. In March 2018, the DBC found Defendant had failed to comply with the
conditions in the September 2015 Order and the November 2017 Order and activated the
suspension imposed in the September 2015 Order. Defendant may apply for a stay afl:er
serving one year of the activated suspension and showing compliance with the
reinstatement requirements stated ill the March 2018 Order.
3.
The violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct found in this Order
formed the basis for the activation of the sllspension imposed in the September 18, 20 I 5
Order, along with other deficiencies in Defendant's compliance WW1 the conditions for
the stay of the suspension. One such deficiency was Defendant's failure to fully and
accurately identify the clients to whom belong the Wells Fargo funds with sufficient
cOlToborating documentation to support disbursement of the funds.
4.
Defendant did not begin efforts to reconcile the BB&T trust account until
contacted by the State Bar in January 2017. During 2017, Defendant made substantial
efforts to reconcile the BB&T trust account.
5.

During 2017, Defendant began effolts to identify the Wells Fargo funds.

6.
When notified by the State Bar of concerns regarding the Mills and Perez
funds, Defendant promptly deposited those amounts back into the trust account along
with other amounts also being examined.
7.
Defendant.

There is no evidence of any dishonest or selfish motive on the part of

8.
Conducting reconciliations of the trust account is the lynchpin of proper
maintenance and protection of entrusted funds.
9.
Allowing client funds to be improperly maintained or disbursed, even if
illadvcltently, places entrusted funds at risk and erodes the confidence clients place in
attorneys who handle their affairs. As a result, such conduct harms the profession as a
whole.
10.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and
disbarment, in considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
11.
The Hearing Panel has considered the suspension imposed in the
September 18,2015 Order of Discipline, the November 2017 order extending the stay of
suspension, the activation of the suspension in March 2018, and the conditions for
reinstatement in the September 2015 and March 2018 orders.

Based on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO DISCIPLlNE

1.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different f01111S of
discipline available to it. Tn addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin. Code lB.0116(f)(1) and concludes the following factors
walTant suspension of Defendant's license:
a.

Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the 11a1111 or potential hann is
foreseeable, to wit: failing to take corrective action to ensure proper,
reconciling, maintenance, disbursement, and accounting for entrusted
funds; and

b.

Defendant's actions potentially had a negative impact on the public's
perception of the legal profession.

The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.
2.
Admin. Code IB.0116(f)(2) and concludes no factors are present in this instance that
would warrant disbarment.

3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.c'
Admin. Code IB.OI16(f)(3) and concludes the following factors are applicable in this
matter:
a.

Prior disciplinary offenses;

b.

Absence of a dishonest or selfish motive;

c.

Timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of
misconduct in 2017;

d.

Multiple offenses;

c.

A pattern of misconduct;

f.

Full and free disclosure to the Hearing Panel and cooperative attitude
toward the proceedings; and

g.

Remorse.

Defendant's conduct, if continued by Defendant or tolerated by the Bar,
4.
poses significant potential harm to future clients.

5.
The Hearing Panel has considered issuing an admonition, reprimand or
censure but concludes that such discipline would not be sufficient discipline because of
Tile North Carolilla State Bar v. Jeffrey D. Smith
Consent Order of Discipline, 18 DHC 26

Page 6 of9

the gravity of the potential harm to the clients. The Panel fUlther concludes that such
discipline would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses committed by
Defendant and send the wrong message to attorneys regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar in this State.

6.
This Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and concludes that it
suspension is necessary for the protection of clients and the public. Conditions tor
reinstatement to active status and conditions during any stayed period of suspension are
appropriate to ensure compliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct.
7.
For these reasons, this Hearing Panel finds that an order imposing
discipline short of a suspension of Defendant's law license would not be appropriate.
