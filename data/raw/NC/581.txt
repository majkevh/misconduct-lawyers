CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. The Court has jurisdiction of this cause pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28(g) & U)
and pursuant to its inherent authority over attorneys.
2. Due to Ferguson's inability to attend court to handle his clients' matters, his
continuing to practice law poses a tlu'eat of significant potential harm to his clients, to the public,
to the profession, and to the administration of justice.
3. It is in the best interest of Ferguson's clients, the public, the profession and the
administration of justice that Ferguson be transferred to disability inactive status until he
provides proof to the Court of his compliance with the conditions imposed herein.

THE COURT THEREFORE ORDERS THAT:
1. Brad Harrison Ferguson is hereby transferred to disability inactive status and shall not
practice law in North Carolina until reinstated by the Court.
2 . Ferguson may petition the Court for a hearing to determine whether he should be
reinstated from disability inactive status once he has provided proof that he has completed the
following:
a.

Ferguson has obtained a substance abuse assessment and has completed all
recommended treatment, including any recommendation for inpatient
treatment;
b. Ferguson has obtained a complete physical examination from a medical
doctor, including all appropriate blood work, and has provided the Court a
complete report from the physician as to the state of his health.
c. Ferguson has obtained weekly urine or blood tests and has provided the Court
with at least 4 weeks of drug screen reports that are free from the presence of
any illicit controlled substances.
d. Ferguson has obtained a mental health evaluation from an appropriate agency
and provided the Court with a copy of the report.
3. To be reinstated, Ferguson must show by clear and convincing evidence that he does
not suffer from a mental or physical condition (which may include but is not limited to mental
illness and/or substance abuse) which significantly impairs his professional judgment,
performance, or competency as an attorney.
4. The Office of Counsel of the North Carolina State Bar should be served with a copy
of any filing and notified of any hearing relating to this matter.
5. This cause is retained for further orders of this Court.
