Bilsed upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and ConclusioilS of Law and upon the
evidence and arguments presented at the hearing concerning appropriate discipline, the
hearing cbmmittee hereby finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following
additional

I"

FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLiNE
1.

Schell's misconcluct is aggravated by the following factors:
a.

Dishonest or selfish motive;

b.

A pattern of misconduct;

c.

Mu1tiple offenses;

I

2.

d.

Refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct; and

e.

Vulnerability of the victims.

Schell's misconduct is mitigated by the following factor:
a.

3.

I

T~e

Absence of a prior disciplinary record.
aggravating factors substantially outweigh. the mitigating factors.

4.
Schell's conduct has resulted In significal1.t harm to the profession.
Schell's neglect, failure to c01llII).unicate with cli~nts, and failure to retul.11
unearned fees caused his clients to feel their trust had been betrayed. SeVeral of
Schell's former clients expressed a sense of distrust of the legal profession in
.
general due to Schell's conduct.
5.
Schell's conduct resulted in potential significant hatm to the· profession.
The legal profession is entrusted with the privilege of self-regulation. The State
Bar can only regulate the profeSSIon if its members respond to inquiries of the
State Bar and otherwise participate in this self-regulation. Schell's failure to
participate in this self.:regulation jeopardizes the profession's ability to remain
self-regulating.

I

6.
Schell's conduct resulted in signific81lt harm to his clients. Schell's theft
of Hicks' funds has left her with outstanding medical bills and ongoing collection
efforts by medical providers who should h.ave been paid by the money Schell
embezzled. Schell's conduct jeopardized his clients' ability to pursue claims or
relief, including but not limited to Heintz's ability to bring a claim on behalf of
her h1:lsband's estate and Watts' ability to file a Motion for Appropriate Relief.
Additionally, Schell's failure to attend the child custody.hearing on behalf of the
Cal dwells and his failure to notify the Caldwells of the hearing date So they could
attend resulted in the child custody issue being decided against the Caldwells.
This result then allowed this child, who was Jamillah's granddaughter ;and·
Shirley's great-granddaughter, to be adopted outside the family.
7.
The hearing committee has .considered lesser sanctions and finds that
disbarment is the only appropriate discipline in this case. The hearing committee
finds that disbarment is the only sanction that can adequately serve to protect the
public from future transgressions by this attorney given the clear demonstration of
misappropriation of client funds, the substantial pattern of neglect resulting in
significant client harm, and the pattern of dishonesty established by the evidence.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Findings of
fact Regarding Discipline, the hearing committee hereby enters the following

'\

---------------------------------------

ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

It
The Defendant, Paul R. Schell, is hereby DISBARRED from the practice
of law in North Carolina.
2.
The costs of this action ate taxed to Schell. He must pay the costs within
30 days 0f service of the statement of costs by the Secretary.
Schell may not seek reinstatement of his license to practice law until he
3~
submits written proof to the Office of Counsel of the State Bar that he has made
restitution to the Client Security Fund of the North Carolina State Bar of all amounts paid
by the Fund to his former clients before filing a petition for reinstatement of his law
license..
