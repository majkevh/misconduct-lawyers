JOHN H. 'RUSH,
ATTORNEY A,T LAW

On October 27, 1993, the Grievance Committee of,the North'
Carolina State Bar met and considered'the grievc;inc:::e filed (;igaihst
you by the North' Carolina State Ba.r.' .
Pursuant to section 13 (A) of article IX of the Rules and
Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar, the Grievance
Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the
information available to it, including your response to the'
letter of notice, the Grievance Committee found probable cause.
Probable ca'l.,lse is defined in the r.ules as "reasonable cause to·
believe that a member of the North Carolina State Bar is guil.ty
of misconduct justifying disciplinary action.'"
" , l.1I
.

.

The ruie$ provide that after a finging of,probable cause,
the Grievance Committee may determine that the, filing ·of a
'complaint and a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission are not required and the Grie".rance Committee may is-sue
various levels of discipline depending upon the mis,conduct ,the
actual or potential injury caused, and any aggravating or
mitigating factors.· The Grievance Committee may issue. an
. admonition, rep;rimand, or censure 't;:o the respondent, attorney.
A reprimand is a written form of discipline' more seri.ous
,than an admonition issued in cases in which an attorney has
"viol,ated one or more'provisions of the Rules of Professional,
Conduct and has caused harnl or potential harm to a'client;the
administrat:i,ono;t: justice, the profession, or a member of. the
puplic, but the ,misconduct, does. not require a censure.
The GrievCl-nce Committee was of the opinion that a censure.is
not· required in ,this case and issues t-his reprimand to you. .:As
chairman of the 'GrievCl-nce Committee o;t: the 'North Carolina State
Bar, it is. now my duty to issue this reprima I1 d and I am ceJ:'tain
that you will. understand fully the spirit in Which this duty i!3 .
, performed. '
Prior to Sept. 17, 1992, yo\.+ handled client funds,on
occasion, but did not maintain a trust account. Instead, you .
kept thes'e client funds in an office or, business account in which
you also kept peJ;"sonal funds. Rule 10'.1 (C) of th~ Rules of
Prof,essional Conduct requires attorneys to keep client and

fiduciary funds in ~ trust acc;:ount 'and fOl:'bids;,.:~:ttorneys to
commingle client, and personal' funo.s. 'You -vi'bla:ted this rule by
placing client funds in an office or business account into which
your personal funds had also been'placed.
It' also appears that, prior to September 1992, yOU
occasionally advanc.ed living expenses to clients for whom you
were handling persopal injury matters. Rule 5.3(B) of the Rules
of Professional Conduct provides that an attorney may advance the
costs of litigation ·to a client l provided that the client remains
ultimately 'responsible for such c()$~s. 'You violated Rule. 5.3 .(B)
by advancing sums to clients for items which did not constitute
litigation' 'costs, such as· food, 'utilities and medicine.

You are hereby reprimanded by the North Carolina State Bar
due to your professional misconduct. The Grievance Committee
trusts thai you will h~ed this reprimand, that ~t will be
'remembered py you, that it will be beneficial to you, and that
you will'never again allow yourself to depart from adherence to.
the high et·hical st'andards of the legal profession.
In.accordance with ihe policy adopted October 15, 1981 by
the Council. of the .North Carolina .state Bar regarding the taxing
of the admipistrative and investigative costs to any attorney
issued a. reprimand by the Grievance Committee, the costs of this

·that if they insisteq on going to trial, they would have. to pay
you one-third of the settlement offer ($6,000) plus expense~
incurred be~ore he would. represent them at trial; th~t
. compla:;i..:p.ant argued that the employment contract clearly stated
that if no.settlement Was reached· then there would be no fee;
. that you con:tinued to insist that they either agree to the
settlement o,rpay you $6,000 plus expenses; that the Robertsons
could no.t afford to pay.you the $6,00·0 plus expenses and were
un.able to .hire anothe,r lawyer' in such a short periqd of time; and
