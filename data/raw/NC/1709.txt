5. Between, September'30, 1989 and November '20, 1989,

irrevocable trust for his son, B~andon Lee Johnson.

6. Defendant did not report the receip~ of more than $10,000
from Johnson in related transactions to the IRS on a Form ,8300 as
required py law.
'7.
By not reporting the receipt of $10,000 or more in cash
to the IRS, Defendant assisted his client, Johnson, in concealing "
income received from illegal activity.
;
"

1','-

,

8. As a result of Defendant's failing to report the receipt
of the $37,000 in cash fr6m Johnson in related tr~nsaction$,
Oefendant was charged in ~ Bill of Information in the United
States District Court for the Western District of North Carolinai
Charlotte DiVision, with felony'violations of 26, U.S.C. Sec.
6050t, 26 ,U.S.C. S~c. 7203, and ~8 U;S.C. Sec. 2.
'

'

9 ~ On Febl;"uary 6, 1992, D~fEmdant entered a', plea of guilty
. to the one count contained in the Bill of Informa'tion.
10. Qn April 3, 1992 a sentencing hearing was conducted
before District Judge Robert D. Potter. A judgment dated April
3, 1992 was signed by.Judge Potter.
11.' The offense for which Defendant, was convicted was an
offense that showed professionai Unfitness.
12. The offense for .which Defendant was convicted reflected
adversely on Defendant's fitness as a lawyer.
13. The offense for which De'fendant was convicted was a
serious offense as defined in Se¢. 3 (LL) of Arti¢le IX of the
Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina state Bar.
14. The allegation in the Complaint in this matter that
$37,000 was deli,vered to Defendant by Johnson in two "pieces" and
that Defendant "structured"'the receipt' of the funds on his books
in an effo,rt to avoid the IRS reporting requirements was based
upon the uncontested testimony' of the IRS agent, who testified at,
Defendant's sentencing hearing, that Johnson indicated to the
agent that the $37,000 was delivered in two "pieces". After the
Complaintwqs filed, it was discovered that Defe'ndant's
bookkeepers ,were prepared to testify that Johnson delivered ,the
cash to them in Defendant's office on six occassions in the
alllounts and' ;on the dates shown on Defendant's ledger rather than
in tWe) i'pieqes". Having only the prospective testimony of
Johnson to prove the more serious·allegation, the State Bar
elected to' abandon tha,t claim before the commen¢ement of this
h~aring. '
