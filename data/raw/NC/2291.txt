A Reprimand is a, written form of discipline more serious, ~~ an Admonition issued in
cases in which an attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Prof~s~ional
Conduct and has caused' harm or potential harm to a client, the administration of justice; the,
profession, or a member or the pUblic, but the misconduct does not require a Censure.
The Grievance Committee was of the opinion that a Censure is ,not required in this case
and issues this Reprimand to you. As chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North .
Carolina State Bar, it is now my duty to issue this ReprimaIi.d a~d I am certain that you ,will' '
understand fully the spirit in which this duty is performed.

The above mentioned seVen clients r~tained you in July 1998 to handle emplOyniynt
discrimipation cases against their former employer, Campbell Soup Cqmpany. You filed ~uit for
these clients and the case was removed to the United States District Court for the Middle District
of North Carolina. The employees had no direct evidence of employment discrhnination.

l
Consequently, .to prevail on their claims they needed to establish that similarly sitUated employees
had been treated differently. 'Therefore, 'discovery in those claims was criti,cal.
The Committee found that you failed to do any discovery after you filed lawsuits on
behalf of these clients. Additionally, you and yoUr clients were required to attend a mandatory
mediation conference scheduled for June 21, 1999.' You failed to notify your clients of the
conference and failed to appear yourself. You were subsequently sanctioned by the' federal court
for fajling to appear at the mediation conference.
The defendants filed a motion fQr sum.mary judgement. You failed to notify your clients
about the motion for sumrtlaryjudgment, or collect any affidavits or other evidence to contest that
motion. Additionally, in your response to the motion for SUll1IIl~y judgment, you incorporated
the defendants' 'version of the facts. The court granted summary judgement against your clients.

'I

Y ou sub~equently filed a notice of appeal of the order granting summary judgment on
behalf of your d,lients. However, you did not discuss with your clients appealing the order prior
to filing the notice. You subsequently met with yom clients regarding pursuing an appeal and ,
provided them with copies of the surwnary judgment order with the date of the order deleted. By
your own admis:sion, you deleted the date so that your clients would not be aware that you
already had file<;l an appeal before discussing the matter with them.
The Committee concluded that your above-mentioned actions violated the following
Revised Rules of Professional Conduct. First, by failing to pursue any discovery, submit
evidence in response to the motion for sl!1Dl1iary judgment, or attend the mediation conference,
you violated ReVised,Rules Ll(b) ..and 1.3. Second, by failing to advise your clients of the order
granting summaty judgment before the appeal time expired, you violated Revised Rule 1.4(a)'and
(b). Third, by filing an appeal without diSCUssing the matter with your clients, you violated
Revised Rule 1.2(a); Fourth, by deleting the filling date on the order granting summary
judgment that you provided to your clients; you misled your clients and misrepresented the status'
of the case in an :attempt to cover up your failure to communicate with them promptly in violation
of Revised Rule $'.4(c)

~:..

The Committee found the following aggravating and mitigating factors: In aggravation,
the Committee found multiple violations and substantial experience in the practice oflaw. In
mitigation, the Cbll1Ihittee found that you experienced serious health problems, which
Significantly impacted yom ability to practice law. The Committee also foUnd as mitigating
factors your abse:pce of a prior disciplinary record, the' ab~ence of a dishonest motive, and the
federal court's imposition of other sanctions for your failure to attend the medIation conference.
You are hereby Reprimanded by the North Carolina State Bar due to yoUr professional
misconduct. The Grievance Committee trusts that you will heed this Reprimand, that it will be
remembered by you, that it will be beneficial to you, arid that you will never again allow yourself
to depart from ~dherence to the high ethical standards of the legal profession.
