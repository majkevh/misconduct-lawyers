Based upon Defendant's admissions in the complaint an Order Granting Partial
Summary Judgment was entered on 21 February 2014. Therefore, the following
undisputed facts were established by the Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment:
1.
Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar (hereafter "State Bar"), is a body
duly organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this
proceeding under the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statntes of North
Carolina, and the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar promulgated
thereunder.
2.
Defendant, Kia N arissa Scott (hereafter "Defendant" or "Scott"), was
admitted to the North Carolina State Bar on 24 August 2007 and is an Attorney at Law
subject to the rules, regulations, and Rules of Professional Conduct of the North Carolina
State Bar and the laws of the State of North Carolina.
3.
During the relevant period referred to herein, Scott was actively engaged
in the practice of law and maintained a law office in Concord, Cabamls County, North
Carolina.

Trust accounts - failure to reconcile
Scott maintained two attorney trust accounts, Wachovia Bank trust
4.
account ending in no. 6620 (hereinafter "Wachovia trust account") and Fifth Third Bank
trust account ending in no. 5268 (hereinafter "Fifth Third trust account").
5.
Scott failed to maintain proper client ledgers which accurately tracked the
deposit and disbursement of client funds in the Wachovia trust account and Fifth Third
trust account.
6.
Scott failed to perform quarterly or monthly reconciliations of the
Wachovia trust account and Fifth Third trust account as required by the Rules of
Professional Conduct.
Alteration of official court records
On or about 19 October 2012 at approximately 11:35 a.m., Scott appeared
7.
in Cabarrus County Administrative Traffic Court on behalf of ten clients.

8.
ADA Jennifer Hancock was the assistant district attorney assigned to run
administrative traffic court on 19 October 2012. By the time Scott arrived at
administrative traffic court, the Cabarrus County's District Attorney's Office had already
completed their plea negotiations with defense attorneys. Therefore, ADA Hancock was
not available to talk with Scott about Scott's clients' cases when Scott arrived.
ADA Hancock informed Scott that though ADA Hancock was unable to
9.
talk with Scott, Scott could go to the Cabarrus County District Attorney's Office to
attempt to negotiate plea agreements for her clients with another assistant district
attorney.
10.
After talking with ADA Hancock, Scott left the courtroom with the
official court files ("shucks") for the following clients:
a. J. Manning;
b. V. Smith;
c. R. Price;

d. Y. Culbreth;

e. K. Doe;
f. T. Taylor;
g. A. Childs;

13 DHC 21 - Page 2 of 22

h. E. Brown;

i.

D. Japp; and

j.

L. Robinson.

11.
When Scott left the courtroom, the only handwritten notations on the
shucks were: (i) the date, (ii) the court case number, and (iii) another number that
identified the page of the court docket on which the case could be found.

12.
Approximately ten to twelve minutes later, Scott returned to the
cOUliroom. When Scott returned to the courtroom, the shucks for her clients' cases had
additional handwritten notations of "IE" or "IEND" on them. Scott told ADA Hancock
that ADA Megan Baumgardner had reviewed Scott's clients' cases and had approved the
dispositions as written on the shucks.
13.
In Cabarrus County, it is the prosecutor's office's duty to handwrite any
agreed upon dispositions on the shucks.

14.
The prosecutor's office did not make the additional handwritten notations
on the shucks for Scott's clients' cases. Scott made these additional handwritten
notations.
15.
Scott had also handwritten "VD" on the North Carolina Unifornl Citation
- Court Copy for her clients, V. Smith and J. Manning.
Only the prosecutor's office is authorized to note voluntary dismissals by
16.
handwriting "VD" on the official court copy of the citation.

17.

Scotl's handwritten notations on the shucks, on the official court copies of
the citations for V. Smith and J. Manning, and her statements to ADA Hancock gave the
false impression that the Cabarrus County District Attorney's Office had agreed to
resolve Scott's clients' cases by voluntary dismissal or plea to the lesser offense of
improper equipment.
18.
Scott presented these altered shucks and altered official court copies of
citations to the court as if they represented dispositions that had been agreed upon by
Scott and the Cabarrus County District Attorney's Office. Scott falsely represented to
the court that all parties agreed that the cases should be resolved according to the
handwritten notations on the shucks.

19.
Scott did not engage in any plea negotiations with anyone from the
Cabarrus County District Attorney's Office on behalf of the clients listed in paragraph
10 above.

13 DHC 21 - Page 3 of 22

20.
The Cabanus County District Attorney's Office did not agree that these
cases should have been dismissed, or to accept pleas to the lesser offense of improper
equipment.
21.
On Or about J 6 July 2013, Scott pled guilty to and was convicted of one
count of misdemeanor common law obstruction of justice.
FlNDlNGS OF FACT MADE AT HEARlNG
Based upon the stipulations of the parties and the evidence presented at the
hearing, the Hearing Panel hereby makes by clear, cogent and convincing evidence the
following findings of fact:
22.
ADA Baumgardner did not see Scott on 19 October 2012, nor did she
speak with Scott.
23.
Scott would have been unable to obtain volnntary dismissals for Manning
and Smith had she actually attempted to negotiate these pleas with members of the
District Attorney's Office for Prosecutorial District 19A.
24.
When each case was called before the magistrate and the fraudulent plea
was annonnced, Scott answered "responsible" on behalf of each client, thus further
perpetuating the appearance that the fraudulent pleas were legitimate.
Misappropriation of entrusted funds - Wachovia accounts
25.
Scott maintained the Wachovia trust account for use primarily in her
representation of clients in traffic court matters.
26.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and the
evidence presented at the hearing, the Hearing Panel hereby makes by clear, cogent and
convincing evidence the following:
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. Scott has no prior discipline.

2. Scott had been practicing law for approximately four years when she embezzled
client's entrusted funds and had been practicing for approximately five years when she
altered the official court copies of her clients' traffic citations.
3. Scott was seen by a therapist on 19 October 2012 in connection with stress Scott
was under due to personal and family problems.
4. F~om 27 February 1999 through 3 June 1999, Scott sold Sears merchandise to her
friends for less than the retail price, misused her employee discount card, took Sears
merchandise, and on one occasion, took money from Sears and gave it to her boyfriend.
As a result, Scott was charged with several counts of felony larceny by employee and
pled guilty to 3 counts of misdemeanor larceny.

5. The District Attorney's Office for Prosecutorial District 19A spent approximately
three - four weeks investigating the issue of whether any member of the office agreed to
the dispositions obtained in Scott's clients' traffic cases.
6. The District Attorney's Office has been unable to determine whether Scott
engaged in similar misconduct in any other traffic cases.

7. After Scott's crime was discovered, defense attorneys in Cabarrus County were
no longer trusted to properly handle the official court copies of traffic citations. The
prosecutor's office began to take extra steps to protect the integrity of the official court
copies of traffic citations.

13 DHC 21 - Page 17 of22

8. The extra protective measures instituted by the prosecutor's office have resulted
in a more burdensome process for prosecutors and defense attorneys in Cabarrus County.

Spainhour, Senior Resident Superior Court Judge for Cabarrus County, reassigned to
other lawyers all felony cases in which Scott was appointed to represent the defendant.
10. Judge Spainhour sent a request to district cOUlt judges in Cabarrus County asking
them to reassign any criminal cases in which Scott was appointed to represent the
defendant. Three of the four district court judges reassigned to other lawyers those
misdemeanor criminal cases in which Scott was appointed to represent the defendant.
II. The allegations of Scott's misconduct were well known in Cabarrus County.

12. Reports of Scott's misconduct and criminal guilty plea were reported in the news,
to include: 15 February 2014 Charlotte Observer Article: Concord Attorney Faces
Claims; 18 September 2013 Concord & Kannapolis Independent Tribune Article:
Concord Attorney Faces Disciplinaty Action; 20 October 2013 Concord & Kannapolis
Independent Tribune Article: Concord Lawyer Denies Intentional Wrongdoing; 17
Febluary 2014 Charlotte Observer Article: Concord Attorney Faces Disciplinary
Hearing.

13. Scott has established a reputation among some attorneys in Cabarrus County,
other than those in the district attomey's office, as a hardworking and prepared attorney.

2.

k. imposition of other penalties or sanctions, to wit, interim suspension,

14.

13 DHC 21 - Page 20 of 22

15.
The Hearing Panel has considered all lesser sanctions including:
suspension, censure, reprimand and admonition, and finds that discipline less than
disbannent would not adequately protect the public from Defendant's future misconduct
for the following reasons:

a. Defendant committed a criminal act on multiple occasions, specifically
embezzlement, that reflects adversely on her honesty, trustworthiness or
fitness as a lawyer in other respects;
b. Before being licensed as a lawyer, Defendant committed criminal acts
while serving in the trusted capacity of an employee with access to her
employer's funds and despite being criminally sanctioned for these acts
has again engaged in criminal conduct;
c. Defendant's acts of dishonesty is conduct that is beneath the minimum
standard required as an officer of the court, particularly in regard to her
conduct of presenting false negotiated plea agreements to the court;
d. Defendant has demonstrated a willingness to place her personal interests
above the interests of her clients;
e. Defendant has demonstrated a failure to respect court process and the law
which poses a threat of significant potential hal1ll to the public;
f. Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Defendant committed and
would send the wrong message to lawyers and the public regarding the
conduct expected of members of the Bar of this State;
g. The protection of the public and the legal profession requires that
Defendant not be pel1llitted to return to the practice of law until she
demonstrates the following by clear, cogent and convincing evidence: (i)
that she has refomled, (ii) that she possesses the moral qualifications
required for admission to practice law in North Carolina taking into
account the misconduct that is the subject of this order, (iii) that she
understands the current Rules of Professional Conduct, including but not
limited to those Rules relating to "Safekeeping Property" as set forth in
Rule 1.15 et seq.; and (iv) that reinstatement will not be detrimental to the
public or the integrity and standing of the legal profession. Disbal1llent is
the only discipline that will require Defendant to make such a showing
before returning to the practice oflaw.
