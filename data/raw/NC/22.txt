TO:

The Council ofthe North Carolina State Bar

I, Gordon H. Brown, hereby tender my license to practice and desire to resign from the
North Carolina State Bar. My resignation is extended freely and voluntarily, and is not the result
of coercion or duress, and I am fully aware of the implications of submitting this, my resignation.
I am aware that there is presently pending an investigation or other proceeding regarding
allegations that I have been guilty of misconduct, including the following:

1.
I served as trustee of a trust established by the will of Pinkie Cowan Smith
for the benefit of Edward Tyrone Smith. The trust for Mr. Smith included accounts at
Branch Banking & Trust Co. ("BB&T") checking account number 5111241092, BB&T
certificate of deposit ("CD") account number 58041158628, BB&T CD account number
5804154800, and BB&T CD account number 5804158784.

2.
Between December 15, 1998, and June 1, 2001, I issued checks totaling
approximately 542,000 from the trust checking account payable to myself,
Gordon H. Brown, as payee. These payments of trust funds were without justification or
consideration, without benefit to the beneficiary of the trust, and without prior or
suosequenl Jisdvsure io or approval by llle Coun VI the (1lIST Lenefi::iaiY. I was not
entitled to these funds and misappropriated them. No disclosure or accounting of the
disbursement of trust funds paid to me was made in any document filed by me with the
Court.
3.
I commingled funds belonging to the Smith trust with funds belonging to other
wards and beneficiaries for whom I acted as a fiduciary.
4.
Prior to January I, 2002, I directed that two checks from the firm trust account to
be paid to me. I was not entitled to those funds. The checks were in the amount of
$5,216.96 and $11,242.46

l.

T acknowledge that the facts as set forth in Paragraphs 1-4 are true. I am submitting my
resignation because I know if charges were predicated upon the misconduct under investigation,
I could not successfully defend against them.
This the lfv~ of November 2002.

Gordon H. Brown
