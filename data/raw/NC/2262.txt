)
This matter came on for hearing before the undersigned District Court Judge on August 13 and 14, 2002
in Courtroom 301 of the Civil Courts Building. Present were James M. Goard, counsel for Plaintiff, and Keith
McNary, counsel
, for Defendant.

This Court fmds as fact that this is a case involving issues of motor vehicle negligence and causation.
Jam~s M. Goard (hereinafter Goard) represents Plaintiff. Keith McNary represents Defendant.

2.

Judge for tria~ in Courtroom 301 of the Civil Courts Building. The trial commenced.

Both attorneys, acknowledged the Courts' displeasure and recognized the warning evident in the Courts'
comments.

unprofessional conduct in his reference to opposing counsel. This admonition was made on the recOl:d

6.

Goard proceeded to continue to disregard th~ Court's admonitions, making loud noises during defense
counsels; cross-examination of Plaintiff's witness. Goard continued to sigh, yawn, drop his pen and
make facial expressions that registered incredulity, disgust and exasperation at defense counsel's
questidns.

1.

These ~isruptions and expressions were plainly visible to the jury, serving to undermine the proper
respect and solemnity necessary for the court system to meet its mandate. In addition, the Plaintiffs
counsels' overt display of his feelings and opinion of defense counsel's questions appeared to be
calcula,ted to influenc'e the jury in its consideration of defense counsel's case.
