to a 20 year jail term.
7. As of June, 1988, the tax value of the Booker Avenue house was
approximately $10,000.
8. Between May 23 and June 2, 1988, Regan made several attempts to find
buyers for the Booker Avenue house,but was unable to do so.
9. On May 24, 1988, Regan advised Gavin that he would have to pay $2,500
to $3,000 to prevent the Booker Avenue house from being sold to pay the debts
of the elder Gavin's estate.
10. Regan further advised Gavin in the May 24, 1988 letter that if the
house was sold at auction, that Gavin would probably receive no proceeds
whatsoever.
11. On June 2, 1988, while Gavin was in jail, Regan advised him that he had
been unable to locate any purchasers for the Booker Avenue house.
Regan then agreed to purch?se the Booker Avenue house for $5,000.
12. On June 21, 1988, while Gavin was in prison, Regan brought to Gavin a
deed which Regan had drafted, transferring ownership of the Booker Avenue
house to Regan. Regan als9 provided Gavin with a written release which
revealed that the tax value of the house was $10,000, that Regan was paying
$5,000 for the house and that Regan intended to make a profit from the
transaction with Gavin. Gavin read and signed the release before signing the
deed transferring the house to Regan.
13. Regan did not advis~ Gavin to obtain independent counsel prior to
deciding whether to sell the house to Regan.
14. Regan has no prior

of professional misconduct.

15. Regan did not engage in dishonest conduct with Gavin or with the N.C.
State Bar respect-irig Gavin' sgrievance against Regan.
16. The Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar found that
there was no probable cause to beli~ve th,at Regan fraudulently altered
documents to incorrectly reflect a pttrchape price of $5,000 rather than
$50,000 for the Booker Ave. house, as initially alleged by Gavin in his
grievance against Regan.
Based upon the foregoing stipulated Findings of Fact, the Hearing Committee
makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. The Defendant's cohd~ct constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to
N.C. Gen. Stat. Section 84-28(a) in that Regan violated Rule 5~4(A) by
engaging in a business transaction which was not entirely fair to the client.
2. The Defendant did not violate any other provisions of the Rules of
Professional Conduct in relation to his representation of Gavin.
Based upon the ~oregoing FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW and upon
tne -\.,;",-.:.s~n1;_of the parties j the Hearing Committee- euters the following:
