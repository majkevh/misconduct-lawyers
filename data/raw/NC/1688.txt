CENSURE

,
On July 16, 1992, the Grievance Committee o,f the North"
Carolina state Bar met and considered the grievances' filed.,',
against you by MichelleM. Price and the North Carolin~ State
Bar.
'
,
Pursuant to section 13(A) of article IX of the Rules and
Regulations of the North Carolina state Bar, the Grievance ,
Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering"the
information available to it, including your ~esponsetb the
letter of notice, th'e Grievance Committee found probable dCiuse;:.
Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable cause to, '
believe that a member of the North Carolina state Bar is guilty"
of misconduct justifying disciplinary action. il
,
,,'.,.'
, , The rules proviQ.e that after a finding of probable cause,
the Grievance Committee may determine that the filing Q!.a "
cbmp'~aint and a hearing before the Disciplinary HeCi'ril1g ,
Commlssion are not required and the Grievance Committee may issue
various levels of discipline dep!3nding upon the misconc,iuct., the"
actual or potential injury caused, and any aggravating or ,
mi tigating factors. 'The Grievance committee may issue an
admonition, reprimand, or a censure.
A, censu,re is a written form of discipline more seriotr;i':l:lra'n " '
a reprimand, issued in cases in which an attorney 'haS v:i,Qlatej1,
one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional .Condudt.(l~·d,'
has caqsed significant' harm or potential $ignificant 'Aa:rinto, a,,'
'Clj,ent, the administration of justice, the professiono;J;' a'memlier ','
of the public, but the misconduct does not require susp~hsj,on' c.,f .
the attorney's license.
'
The Grievance Committee believes that a hea~ing ,bef,o:r:e tb$· '
Di$ciplinary Hearing Commission is not required in ,thiscas~,a:hd
issues this censure to you. As chairman of the Gr:i.ev,a:11ce
" '",'
committee of the North Carolina state Bar, it is, now my dut,y>to . ,
issue this censure. I am certain that you will unde,rstand fuJ,ly' '
the spirit in which this duty is performed.

'In the matter of Cynthia Monat (91G0579), the,Committee
found that Ms. Monat hired you shortly after her accident ort ,
December 15, 1987 to pursue her personal injury claim~ that "from
March of 1988 through Janua~y 1990 there was ~ittle, if anY'w~rK
done on this matter; that a claim was filed with the'ins\ll;:'a,'tloe ,
company in April of,'1990; that from April of 1990 through Qdt6l:;>er
of 1990 there were ongoing settlement negotiation$ in an effort

to s~ttle this matter; that M~. Monat rejected the final
settlement offer from'the insurance company; that in January of
1991 the insurance company notified you that in their opinion,
the statute of limitations had expired; ahd that a co~plaint was
eventually filed in this matter on JUly 8, 1991.
'
In addition, the committee found that you failed to respond
to the Letter of Notice issued by the Chairman of the Grievance
Committee concerning, this matter and failedtb app.ear and produce
records as ordered by subpoena dated November 21, 1991.
The Qommittee determined that you failed to 4iligently
pursue Ms. Monat's personal injury claim in, violation of Rule
6(B) (3) and failed to respond to the Letter of Notice and
,subpoena served on you in violation of Rule 1.1 o,f the Rules of
Professional Conduct.

I

The Committee found as an aggravating factor the Reprimand
issued to you on February 16, 1992 for similar misconduct
concerning Peter Warren. The Committee' found in mitigation the
personal problems you were experiencing during this time and your
assurances that ~heseproblems are being, dealt with.
II.
In the matter of Michelle Price (92G0362), the Committee
found that you repr~sented Ms. Price at a hearing for temporary
alimony, custody and support held August 14, 1989; that Ms. Price
was award temporary alimony, custody and support and you were
requested to draw the oro-er; that you failed to draft the order
and have it signed despite numerou~ requests by Ms. Price to do
.so: that you were l$ter hired by Ms. Price to represent her
concerning her divorce and to resolve all issues concerning
alimony, custody, suppo~t and visitation; that the divorce
judgment was ultimately entered on January 23, 1992 but it failed
to address the othet outstanding issues; and that you failed to
schedule a hearing and conclude these remaining matters in a
diligent fashion.
The Committee determined that this conduct violated Rule
6(B) (3) which states that a lawyer shall act with reasonable
diligence and promptness in representing the client. As stated
in the comment' to Rule 6, perhaps no professional, shortcoming is
more widely resente~ than procrastination. A client's interests
often can be adversely affect by the passage of time or the
change of conditions. In extreme ~nstances, as when a lawyer
overlooks a statute of limitations, the client's legal position
may qestroyed. Even when the client's interests are not affected
in substance, however, unreasonable delay can cause a client
needless anxiety and undermine confidence in the lawyer's
trustworthiness.

I

The Committee found in aggravation your previous Reprimand
for similar miscqnduct concerning Peter Warren. The Committee
found in mitigation the personal problems you were experiencing
dUring this time and your assurances that these problems are
being dealt with.
'
You are hereby censured by the North Carolina state Bar for
your violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The
Grievance Committee~rusts that you will ponder this censure,
,recognize the error, that you have made, and that you will never
