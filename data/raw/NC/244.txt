I, Glennie M. Matthewson II, hereby tender my license to practice law and desire
to resign from the North Carolina State Bar. My resignation is extended freely and
voluntarily and is not the result of coercion or duress. I am fully aware of the
implications of submitting my resignation.
I am aware that there is pending against me an investigation regarding allegations
that I have been guilty of misconduct, to wit:
I. On July 5, 1994, I settled a personal injury claim for Robert Harris for
$50,000. Pursuant to my agreement with Mr. Harris, I was entitled to a fee amounting to
1/3 of the settlement amount, or $16,666.67. The remaining funds were to be disbursed
to Harris and his medical care providers. Between July 18, 1994 and Nov. 17, 1994,
however, I withdrew a total of $18,241.67 from Mr. Harris' settlement proceeds without
Mr. Harris' consent or knowledge.
2. On April 1, 1993, I settled a personal injury claim for Albert Knight for
$25,000. A total of$16,666.67 of the settlement funds should been disbursed to the
North Carolina Department of Transportation pursuant to a subrogation claim. Following
April 1, 1993, I disbursed the $16,666.67 belonging to the State of North Carolina to
myself and third parties without the knowledge and consent of Albert Knight or the State
of North Carolina.
3. On Oct. 14, 1993, I settled a personal injury claim for Linda Taylor for a total
of $26,000. On Oct. 20, 1993, I disbursed $8,666.67 to Ms. Taylor. Pursuant to my
agreement with Ms. Taylor, I was entitled to a fee of $8,666.67 and the remaining
$8,666.66 should have been disbursed to Ms. Taylor's medical care providers. Between
Oct. 22,1993 and June 20,1994, however, I paid myself a total $13,500 from Ms.
Taylor's settlement proceeds without her knowledge or consent.
I acknowledge that the material facts set out above are true. I am submitting this
resignation because I know that if a complaint was filed based upon the misconduct set
out above, I could not successfully defend against them.
