{a}

By negotiating the $1,000 draft from the insurance company for :cash instead of depositing the draft

funds of a client in a trust bank account separate
from, his own person'al a'ccount in violation of

(b)

By f'ailing to deposit the $1,0.00 draft from the

i

'(c)

By receiving and devoting to his own personal use
more than otle-'third o,f the proceeds del,:j.vered to
