the following
.
FINDINGS OF FACT

I

1. Plaintiff, the'North Carolina State Bar (hereinafter "State Bar"), is a
body duly organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to
bring this proceeding under the' authority granted it in Chapt~r 84 of the General
Statutes of North Carolina., and the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina
State Bar promulgated thereunder.
,
.
2. Defendant, Martin J. Horn (hereint;tfter "Horn"), was admitted to the
North Carolina State Bar on August 23, 1991 ano is, and waS at all times referred
to herein, an Attorney at Law licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the
rules, regulations, and Revised Rules of Professional Conduct of the North
Carolina State Bat and the laws of the State of North Oarolina. .
3. During the times relevant herein, Horn a9tively engaged in the practice
of law in the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office in the City of
Durham, Durham County, North Carolina.

I

,

.
f

4. On or about August 1, 2000 and at all other times relevant herein, Horn
was a partner, and Rose Marie Candy Pahl (hereinafter "Pahl") was employed as
an associate, in the firm Qf Browne, Flebotte, Wilson & Horn, P.L.L.C.
(hereinafter "the firm") .
.d5. on orabout August 1, 2000, Ralph Cecil Bennett (hereinafter
"Bennett") eogageq the firm to represent him in' connection with a domestic
dispute between Bennett and his estranged wife. The attorney at the firm
aSSigned to Bennett's case was Pahl.
'
I

.

,

_

I

e. Pahl represented Bennett in that dispute which concluded on
November 20, 2001 with the entry of various final orders resolving the issues that
had arisen during Pahl's representation of Bennett. Although a previous
Memorandum of Judgment/Order signed by the parties in September 2001
contained language that all attorneys would be released as attorneys of record
upon sighing of the formal jUdgment, none of the orders dated November 20,
2001 b~:>re language relieving Pahl as attorney of record.

I

I

7. On November 27, 2001 opposing counsel in Bennett's case sent to
Pahl a motioh alleging that Bennett was in contempt of a court order dated
November 20; 2001. The motion was scheduled for De'cember 4, 2001 and it
. was eventually heard on January 8, 2002. Before the hearing, Bennett was
timely ~erved With the motion.

e.

When Pahl received the contempt motion, Bennett had no funds on
deposit with the firm upon which to draw to represent him on the contempt matter
and P~hl had difficulty contacting Bennett concerning the motion. On December
3, 2001 Pahl prepared a 'motion requesting permission of the court for the firm to
withdraw from further"representation of Bennett. As of January 8, 2002, Pahl's
motion to withdraw had not been heard by the court and no order allowing
withdrawal had been signed.

9. Before the hearing on the contempt tr\otion on January 8, 2002, Horn
instructed Pahl not to attend the hearing to represent Bennett based on Horn's
belief that the firm was no longer engaged to represent Bennett because of the
various orders entered on November 20, 2001 resolving the disputes for which
Benne~t had originally engaged ·the firm.

I

I

10. Pahl did not attend the hearing on January 8, 2002.
I

:11. When Bennett appeared at the contempt hearing he was appointed
couns~1

by the court.

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Committee enters the
followi~g

2

I

f

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. All parties are properly before the Hearing Committee, and the
Committee has jurisdiction over defendant and the,subject matter ofthis
proceeding.

I

2. Horn's foregoi-ng actions constitute grounds for discipline pursuant to
N.C.G.S. §84,.28(b)(~) in that Horri violated one or more of the Revised Rule$ of
Professional Conduct in effect at the time of the actions as follows:
a. by instructing Pahl not to attend the contempt hearing on Bennett's
behalf, Horn failed to make reasonable efforts in the exercise of direct
supervisory authority over another attorney to ensure Pahl conformed to the
Rules of Professional Conduct in violation of RLile 5.1 (b).
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and ConClusions of Law, the
Hearing Committee also enters the following
FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. Defendant's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
(a) SUbstantial experience in the practice of law.
- 2. pefendant's misconduct is mitigated by the following factors:

I

(a) absence of a prior disciplinary record;
(b) absence of a dishonest motive,
(c) full a!1d free disclosure to the Hearing Committee and
cooperative attitude toward proceedings, and
(d) good reputation in the legal community.
3. the mitigating factor$ outweigh the aggravating factors.
4. Proper -supervision of subordinate attorneys is essential to assure that
all members of the bar adhere to ethical tenets established to maintain the quality
of justice. 9ubordinates who look to a supervisory attorney for guidance should
receive a well-thought-out response consistent with the Rules of Professional
Conduct. However, the Hearing Committee finds and concludes that under the
circumstances of this case Horn's conduct is a minor violation of the Rules and
the public will be adequately protected by admonishing defendant not to continue
or repeat such conduct.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and
Findings Regarding Discipline, and upon consent of the parties, the Hearing
Committee enters the following

.ADMONITION

<>

Pursuant to §§.0109, .0114, and .0123 of the Discipline and
Disability Rules of the North Carolina State Bat; the Hearing Committee of
the Disciplinary Hearing Commission entered a Consent Order of Discipline
of even date herewith. After con~idering the information available to it
contained in the pleadings and within the findings of facts,· conclusions of
law and findings regarding discipline of the Order of Discipline, the Hearing
Committe~ has determined that an admonition is an appropriate disCipline
given the circumstances of this action.

I

The rules provide that after a finding of misconduct, the Hearing
Committee may issue various levels of discipline depending upon the
misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any aggravating or
mitigating factors. The Hearing Committee may issue an admonition,
reprimand, censure, suspension or disbarm~lit.
An admonition, which is the least serious form of discipline
authorized, is imposed in cases in which an attorney has committed a minor
violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.
On or about August 1, 2000, your law firm ~as retained to represent Ralph
Cecil Bennett in a domestic case. Rose Marie Candy Pahl, an associate in YOLir
law firm, was assigned to handle Mr. Bennett's case. The court entered final
orders regarding child custody and support,. a parenting agreement, and divorce
from bed and board and post-separation support. All orders were filed on
Novemb~r 20,2001 and none of those orders contained language releasing the
.
attorneys of record. .
A contempt proc~eding was initiated against Mr. Bennett on November 27,
2001 and initially served on Ms Pahl. Before the hearing regarding contempt

I

.

..
heard on January 8, 2002, Mr. Bennett was timely served with the contempt
documents by opposing counsel.
' .
Attorney Pahl filed a motion to withdraw from Mr. Bennett's case, but as of
Januarx 8. 2002 the court had hot ruled oli her motion. You instructed Attorney
Pahl no~ to attend Mr.· Bennett's contempt hearing on January 8, 2002 because
Mr. Be~nett had hot paid the law firm for representation in that matter.
Ms. Pahl had an obligation to appear at Mr. Bennett's show cause
hearing; Although a Memorandum of Judgment/Order filed on September 25,
2001 st?ted<that all attorneys would be released as attQrneys of record upon
signing bf the formal judgment or order by the presiding judge, the Hearing
Committee believed that Ms. Pahl could not withdraw from representing Mr.
Bennett; in the proceeding until the court had given her permission pursuant to
her motion to withdraw.

I

I

'four conduct violated Rule 5.1 (b) of the ReVised Rules of Professional
Conduct, as your instruction that she not go to court on Mr. Bennett's behalf in
the shoW cause hearing was not in compliance with the rules of professional
conduct~
.
y'ou are hereby admonished by the North Carolina State Bar for your
professibnal misconduct.
