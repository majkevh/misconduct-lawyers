of the Grievance Committee. Schoch never
contacted the clerk's Office of the Middle
Distr~ct; never obtained any documents f~om

I

17. Defendant's statements to Rob~rt F. Hartsell,
investigator for the North Carolina state Bar, as set out in
paragraph 15, subparagraphs (b) and (c) above, were knowing
misrepresentations and/or false statements knowingly made in a

Admissions form was sent to the clerk's office
in th~ Middle District on or after June 8,
1989.

b)

Defendant had contacted his former law
Barbara Moreno l in .an effort to
locate their former Secretary, Lisa George,
who then worked in Washington, D.C. Moreno
had advised Defendant that she had contacted
Lisa George ~nd that Lisa George had no.
rec91lectioh of preparing or sending a
Declaration of Admissions form to the clerk's
office in the Middle District. Moreno gave
Defendant Lisa George's telephone number, but
he never called her.
D~fendant was aware of
Lisa George's position and should have had no
reason to believe that Lisa George would
provide an affidavit supporting Defendant's
version 'of the·facts. Defendant's contact
witn MorenO and ~orenQ's response to Defendant
occur~ed months prior to Defendant's hearing
before the Grievance Committee on January 17,
