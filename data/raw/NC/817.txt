Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the panel cnters the following
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
I.
All parties are properly before the hearing panel and the panel has jurisdiction
over Defendant, Jolm M. Kirby, and over the subject matter of this proceeding.
2.
Defendant's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes
grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(2) as follows:
(a)

By registering and using an accow1t containing another attomey's
biographical and contact information in his interactions with JustAnswer
Corp. and the third-party users of the JustAnswer website, Defendant
engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit and
misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c);

(b)

By advising third-party users ofthe JustAnswer website about the law of
states in which Defendant was not licensed to practice, Defendant practiced
law in jurisdictions where doing so violates the regulation of the legal
profession in that jurisdiction in violation of Rule 5.5(a);

3

(c)

By registering with JustAnswer Corp. and providing legal advice to thirdparty users of the JustAnswer website, Defendant assisted JustAnswer
Corp. in the unauthorized practice oflaw in violation of Rule 5.5(d); and

(d)

By splitting fees paid by third-party users for legal advice received through
the JustAnswer website with JustAnswer Corp., Defendant shared legal
fees with a nonlawyer in violation of Rule 5.4(a).

Based upon the consent of the parties, the hearing panel also finds by clear, cogent,
and convincing evidence the following
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
Defendant acted in a dishonest and deceitful manner when he knowingly and
impermissibly registered and used another attorney's biographical and contact infonnation in
the "ADillon" account with JustAnswer Corp. and conducted business as "ADillon." Such
conduct shows Defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness, and integrity and manifests
Defendant's dishonest or selfish motive in establishing and acting under the false profile for
monetary gain.
2.
Defendant's conduct had the potential to cause significant hann to attorney
Anthony Dillon in that Defendant provided legal advice to numerous individuals using the
"ADillon" account. In doing so, Defendant circumvented Mr. Dillon's ability to protect his
name and reputation in the legal community and with the public in generaL At the time of
Defendant's conduct, such potential harm was foreseeable to Defendant.
3.
Dcfcndant's dishonest conduct caused potential significant ham] to the
standing of the legal profession in the eyes of the public in that such conduct by attorneys
erodes the trust of the public in the profession. Such erosion of public confidence in attorneys
tends to sully the reputation of, and fosters disrespect for, the profession as a whole.
Confidence in the legal profession is a building block for public trust in the entire legal
system.
4.
Defendant's disregard for the licensing requirements of each state in which he
engaged in the lmauthorized practice of law caused potential significant hann to the standing
of the legal profession in the eyes of the public and those individuals to whom he provided the
unauthorized services. Each state has individual licensing requirements that typically include
demonstration of sufficient familiarity with the laws of the state prior to engaging in the
practice oflaw in that state. This system is designed to protect the public by ensuring clients
receive competent representation by a qualified attorney who is properly licensed in that
jurisdiction. By disregarding these requirements, Defendant showed his indifference to his
obligations concerning those to whom he provided legal services as well as the sovereignty of
the attorney regulatory system of each state.
5.

Defendant has no prior disciplinary offenses in over 17 years of practice.

6.
Defendant has fully cooperated with the State Bar's investigation oftb.is matter
and in reaching a resolution in these proceedings.

4

7.
With the exception of the professional misconduct at issue in this case,
Defendant enjoys a reputation of good character in his personal and professional life.
8.
Defendant understands the wrongfulness of his misconduct and is remorseful
for his actions.
9.
When Defendant was contacted by JustAnswer about the discrepancy in the
"ADiIlon" account on or about 30 January 2009, Defendant responded to JustAnswer and
infonned them that he responded to questions under the "ADillon" account, and Defendant
then provided JustAnswer with his con'ect biographical and contact information. JustAnswer
subsequently terminated all of Defendant's accounts with JustAnswer Corp.
Bascd upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel also enters the following
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the hearing panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง .0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and detennines the following factors are applicable:
a. Defendant's lack of prior disciplinary offenses;
b. A dishonest motive on Defendant's pact;
c. Defendant's cooperative attitude toward the proceedings;
d. Remorse;
e. Defendant's reputation for good character; and
f.

Defendant's substantial experience in the practice oflaw.

2.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. 1B ยง .0114(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and
concludes that altllough acts of misrepresentation are present in this case, disbarment is not
necessary in order to protect the public.
3.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. IB ยง .0114(w)(1) of the Rules and Regulations ofthe North Carolina State Bar and
detemlines the following factors waITant suspension of Defendant's license:
a. Defendant's intent to commit acts where the harm or potential harm is
foreseeable;
b. Circumstances reflecting Defendant's lack of honesty, tmstworthiness, or
integrity;

5

c. Defendant's actions potentially had a negative impact on the pnblic's
perception of the legal profession; and
d. Defendant's conduct had a potential adverse affect on third parties.
4.
The hearing panel has considered all other forms of discipline and concludes
that any sanction less than suspension would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the
offenses cDlllinitted by Defendant, would not adequately protect the public, and would send
the wrong message to attorneys and to the public regarding the conduct expected of members
ofthe Bar.
5.
Due to the misrepresentations described in the present action as well as the
significant potential hann resulting ยฃi'Dln Defendant's conduct, the heming panel finds and
concludes that active suspension of Defendant's license for a set period of time is the only
discipline that will adequately protect the public from future transgressions by Defendant.
6.
Defendant should be allowed the opportunity to apply for a stay of a portion of
the suspension imposed by this Order upon compliance with certain conditions designed to
ensure protection of the public and designed to ensure Defendant's continued compliance
with the Rules of Professional Conduct.
