CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27 N.C.
Admin. Code IB § .OI14(w)(I), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar, and
concludes that the following factors that warrant suspension or disbarment are present:

a. intent of the defendant to cause the resulting harm or potential harm;
b. intent of the defendant to commit acts where the harm of potential

harm is foreseeable;
c. circumstances reflecting the defendant's lack of honesty,

f. negative impact ofthe defendant's actions on the administration of
justice;
g. impainnent of client's ability to achieve the goals ofthe
representation; specifically, Mr. Holbrook and the Pritchards; and
h. acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication.
2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27 N.C.
Admin. Code IB § .Ol14(w)(2), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar, and
concludes that the following factors that warrant disbarment are present:
a. acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication;
b. misappropriation or conversion of assets of any kind to which the
defendant or recipient is not entitled, whether from a client 01' any
other source; and
c. commission of a felony.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.
Admin. Code IB § .OI14(w)(3), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar, and
concludes that the following are applicable in this matter:
a. dishonest or selfish motive;
b. pattern of misconduct;
c. multiple offenses;
d. 19 years experience in the practice oflaw.
4.
By misappropriating entrusted client funds, Defendant has caused harm to

8.
The Hearing Panel has considered all lesser sanctions including:
suspension, censure, reprimand and admonition and finds that discipline less than
disbarment would not adequately protect the public from Defendant's future misconduct
for the following reasons:
a. Defendant committed a criminal act, specifically embezzlement,
that reflects adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness
as a lawyer in other respects and violated the trust of his
clients, including the Pritchards and Holbrook;
b. entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Defendant
committed and would send the wrong message to lawyers and
the public regarding the conduct expected of members of the
Bar of this State;
c. the protection of the public and the legal profession requires that
Defendant not be permitted to return to the practice oflaw until
he demonstrates the following by clear, cogent and convincing
evidence: (i) that he has reformed, (ii) that he possesses the
moral qualifications required for admission to practice law in
North Carolina, taking into account the misconduct that is the
subject of this order, (iii) that he understands the CUiTent Rules
of Professional Conduct, including but not limited to those
Rules relating to "Safekeeping Property" as set forth in Rule
1.15 et seq.; and (iv) that reinstatement will not be detrimental
to the public or. the integrity and standing of the legal
profession. Disbarment is the only discipline that will require
Defendant to make such a showing before returning to the
practice of law.

Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel hereby enters the following:
DEFAULT ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
