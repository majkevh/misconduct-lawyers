Panel makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.
All patties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the DHC has jurisdiction
over Defendant, Steve L. Combs, and over the subject matter of this proceeding.

2.
Defendant's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes grounds
for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(2) in that Defendant violated the Rules of
Professional Conduct as follows:
4

(a)

By failing to timely complete the final title opinion and disburse the title

with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client in violation
of Rule 1.3 and failed to promptly disburse client funds in violation of Rule
1.1S-2(m);

(b)

By failing to inform Duan of his failure to complete the final title opinion and
disburse the title insurance premium to obtain the title policy for Duan,
Combs failed to keep his client reasonably informed about the status of the
matter in violation of Rule 1.4(a)(3);

(c)

By failing to preserve the title insurance premium entrusted to him and
deposited in his trust account and by disbursing his client's entrusted funds to
himself or to a third patty for his personal benefit or for the benefit of
someone other than the beneficial owner of the funds, Combs failed to
properly maintain and disburse entrusted funds in violation of Rules I.lS-2(a),
0), and (m);

(d)

By failing to timely complete final title opinions, by failing to timely disburse
title insnrance premiums, by failing to disburse title insurance premiums to
obtain title policies for owners and/or lenders, and by failing to address title
issues raised by the title insurance company, Combs failed to act with
reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client in violation of
Rule 1.3 and failed to promptly disburse client funds in violation of Rule I.IS2(m);

(e)

By failing to preserve the title insurance premiums entrusted to him and
deposited in his trust account and by disbursing his clients' entrusted funds to
himself or to a third party for his personal benefit or for the benefit of
someone other than the beneficial owner of the funds, Combs failed to
properly maintain and disburse entrusted funds in violation of Rules 1.IS-2(a),
0), and (m);

(f)

By disbursing more funds for clients than he had in his trust account for such
clients, thereby misusing entrusted funds he held in his trust account for the
benefit of other clients, Combs failed to properly maintain and disburse
entrusted funds in violation of Rules I.1S-2(a), 0), and (m);

(g)

By failing to maintain proper client ledgers, by failing to perfOlm monthly and
quatterly reconciliations of the accounts into which he deposited entrusted

attorney bust account in violation of Rules I.1S-3(b)(I), 1.1S-3(b)(2), 1.1S3(b )(S), 1.1S-3(d)(l), and I.1S-3(d)(2);

S

(h)

instead depositing Mason's entrusted funds in his operating account, Combs
failed to deposit mixed funds in his trust account in violation of Rule 1.152(g) and failed to preserve entrusted funds provided to him in violation of
Rules 1.15-2(a) and (b); and

(i)

By depositing $125.00 of entrusted client funds into his operating account and
disbursing those funds for personal or office expenses without authorization
ii-om the legal or beneficial owner of the funds, Combs failed to preserve
entrusted funds provided to him in violation of Rules 1.15-2(a) and (b), and
used entrusted funds for his personal benefit or the benefit of a person other
than the legal or beneficial owner of the funds in violation of Rule 1.15-20).

Based upon the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel also finds by clear, cogent, and
convincing evidence the following
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

I.

Defendant has substantial experience in the practice of law.

2.
There is no evidence that Defendant intended to harm his clients and there is no
evidence of any dishonest or selfish motive on the pad of Defendant.
3.
Defendant's conduct in over-disbursing entrusted funds from his trust account
caused significant harm to his clients whose entrusted funds were used for the benefit of
someone other than the beneficial owner of the funds without their lmowledge or consent.
Defendant's conduct also impaired his clients' abilities to achieve the goals of their respective
representations by delaying the conclusion of their real estate transactions and compromising
their financial ability to do so.
4.
Conducting quarterly reconciliations of the trust account is the lynchpin of proper
maintenance and protection of entrusted funds. Had Defendant been conducting quarterly
reconciliations, he would have seen balances remaining for various clients which would have
signaled that work, such as obtaining the title policy, still needed to be done in the file.
Additionally, had Defendant been conducting quarterly reconciliations, he would have also had
to identifY the funds in his trust account and would have maintained awareness of whose funds
were in his trust account and the appropriate disbursement of those funds. Defendant's
continued failure to reconcile his trust account and failure to maintain proper tr'ust account
records demonstrates a pattem of misconduct and demonstrates Defendant's intent to commit
acts where the potential harm is foreseeable.
5.
The lenders in the residential real estate transactions closed by Defendant were
vulnerable clients in that it was solely through Defendant that the title insurance premium from
the loan proceeds held by Defendant in his trust account could be disbursed to the title insurance
company and the title policy obtained.
6.
The title insurance companies are third pmties affected by Defendant's failure to
timely disburse title insurance premiums and complete final title opinions. Defendant's failure to
6

pay the premium and provide the necessary final title opinion impedes the title 111surance
companies' abilities to issue title policies.
7.
Defendant's conduct - allowing client funds to be improperly maintained or
disbursed, even if inadvertent - places entmsted funds at risk and has the potential to cause
significant harm to the standing of the profession in the eyes of the public because it shows his
disregard for his duties as an attorney. Such erosion of public confidence in attorneys tends to
sully the reputation of, and fosters disrespect for, the profession as a whole. Confidence in the
legal profession is a building block for public trust in the entire legal system.
8.

Defendant has no prior disciplinmy offenses.

9.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fOlms of discipline
available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and disbarment, in
considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, and with the consent of the parties, the I-Iearing Panel makes the
following:
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fotms of discipline
available to it.
2.
The Hem'ing Panel considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code 1B ยง .OI14(w) ofthe Discipline and Disciplinmy Rules of the North Carolina State Bar.
3.
The Hearing Panel concludes that the following factors fi'om ยง .0114(w)(I),
which are to be considered in imposing suspension or disbarment, me present in this case:
(a) intent of the defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential hmm is
foreseeable;
(b) Defendant's actions had a potential negative impact on his clients' and the
public's perception of the legal profession;
(c) impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the representation; and
(d) effect of Defendant's conduct on third patiies.
4.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enwnerated in ยง .OI14(w)(2)
of the Rules and Regulations of the Notih Carolina State Bm' and concludes no factors are
present in this instance that would wmTant disbarment.
5.
The Hearing Panel concludes that the following factors from ยง .0114(w)(3),
which m'e to be considered in all cases, are present in this case:

7

(a) absence of prior disciplinary offenses;
(b) absence of a dishonest or selfish motive;
(c) a pattern of misconduct;
(d) multiple offenses;
(e) vulnerability of Defendant's clients; and
(f) Defendant's substantial experience in the practice oflaw.
6.
Defendant's conduct caused significant harm to his buyer and lender clients,
whose funds were not properly maintained and disbursed and who did not receive the desired
product ofthe intended disbursements (e.g. title policies).
7.
Defendant's conduct caused potential significant harm to both his clients and to
the title insurance companies. The absence of title policies could have been, or could be in the
future, significantly harmful to the client and the title insurance company if a title issue arose or
arises before being remedied.
8.
Defendant's conduct, if continued or tolerated by the Bar, poses significant
potential harm to future clients.
9.
The Hearing Panel has considered admonition, reprimand, and censure as
potential discipline but finds that admonition, reprimand, or censure would not be sufficient
discipline because of the gravity of the harm to clients and the significant threat of potential harm
to the public.
10.
The Panel finds that any sanction less than suspension would fail to acknowledge
the seriousness of the offenses committed by Defendant, would not adequately protect the public,
and would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar in this State.
11.
Due to Defendant's numerous violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the
public can only be adequately protected by a period of active suspension of Defendant's law
license. Defendant should be allowed the opportunity to apply for a stay of a portion of the
suspension imposed by this Order upon compliance with certain conditions designed to ensure
protection of the public and to ensure Defendant's compliance with the Rules of Professional
Conduct.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Findings and
Conclusions Regarding Discipline, and with the consent of the pmties, the Hearing Panel enters
the following
