CENSURE

On Jamlary 13, 1999, the Grievance Commlttee ofthe North Carolina State Bar met ~d
considered the grievances filed against you by several clients.
Pursuant to section .OI13(a) of the Discipline and Disability Rules ofthe North Carolin;:t.
State Bar, the Grievance Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the
information available to it, including your responses to the letters of notice, the Grievance
Committee foUnd probable cause.
Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable cause to believe that a member of the
North Carolina State Bar is guilty of mIsconduct justifying disciplinary action."
The rules provide that after a finding of probable cau~e, the Grievance COl11111itt~e may
determine that the filing of a complaint and a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission are not required, and the Grievance Committee may issue various levels or
discipline depending upon the misconduct~ the actual or pot~ntial injury caused, and any
aggravating or mitigating factors. The Grievance Committee may issue an Admonition, a
Reprimand, or a Censure.

I

A Censure is a written form of discipline more serious than a Reprimand, issued in cases
in which ~ attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct
and has caused significant harm or potential significant harm to a client, the administration of
justice, the profession or a member of the public, but the misconduct does not require suspension
of the attorney's license.
The Grievance Committee believes that a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission is not required in this case and issues this Censure to you. As chairman of the
Grievance Committee ofthe North Carolina State Bar, it is now my duty to issue this Censure. I
am certain that you will understand fully the spirit in which this duty is performed.

a stipulation .of dismissal on April 15, 1998 to avoid sanctions being imposed ag~inst him for
filing this suit.
The Committee found that your above-described conduct violated several Rules of

administrative remedies, ensuring that the statute of limitations had ri5t expired, and determining
that his claims were governed by the arbitration clause of a collective bargaining agreement, you
filed the suit without preparation adequate under the circumstances in violation of Rule 6(a)(2)

File Number 98G0478(1V)
In approximately April 1997, your client, AK, retained you to represent him in a
previously filed ADA claim against Roadway Express and Teamsters Union, his employer and
union, respectively. Ultimately, AK was forced to dismiss this suit, which was filed by another
attorney, because the summons was not timely served on the defendants.
You subsequently filed. a second suit on behalf of AK 011 February 3, 1998 in the United
States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina against the same defend;mts.
This suit was for breach of contract of a collective bargaining agreement. The c()llective
bargaining agreement contained a mandatory arbitration clause. Also, the breach of contract
Claim was subject to a six-months limitation period which the Committee found ha4 run
significantly before February 3, 1998.

determine whether or not AK had a viable claim for breach of contract before filing the second
suit. The Committee found that your above-described conduct violated several Rules of
Professional Conduct. The Committee foun~ that by filing AK's second suit and doing little, if
any, background investigation or basic researc;h on his claim, you violated Rules 6(a)(2) and
7.2(a)(l).

In deciding to issue you a censure for the above-mentioned misconduct, the Committee
considered the following aggravating and mitigating factors. In aggravation, the Committee
considered the following factors:
(a) You were previously reprimanded by this committee in November of 1997 for
. filing a frivolous employment discrimination claim;
(b) You were sanctioned on five occasions between January 1997 .and March
1998 for filing frivolous employment discrimination lawsuits;

(e) You had committed multiple violations of the Rules; and

(1:) You have substantial experience in the practice oflaw.
lIn mitigation, the Committee considered heavily the fact that you are already under a
four-year stayed suspension and one of the conditions of the stay is that you commit no future
violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. the Committee noted that all of the allegations
set forth above in the Censure occurred before the Disciplinary Hearing Commission ("DHC")
trial, which resulted in YOl.ir four-year stayed suspension. In other words, it appeared that you
had undergone some interim rehabilitation between the times of the actions set forth in the
Censure and the time of the quarterly Grievance Committee meeting. The Committee also noted
that the: DHC panel that imposed a stayed suspension was aWare of your pattern of misconduct
set forth in this Censure.

as a strong reminder and inducement for you to weigh carefully in the future your responsibility
to the phbiic, your clients, your fellow attorneys and the courts, to the end that you demean
