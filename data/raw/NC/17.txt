AFFIDAVIT

TO:

The Council of The North Carolina State Bar

I, Percel H. Brown, hereby tender my license to practice and desire to resign from The
North Carolina State Bar. My resignation is tendered freely and voluntarily, is not the result of
coercion or duress. and I am fully aware of the implications of submitting the resignation.

I am aware that there are presently pending investigations or other proceedings regarding
allegations that 1have been guilty of misconduct, specifically that:
I) On or about May 28, 1998. funds totaling $97,687.20 were wired into my trust account

for a loan closing on behalf of David Stauffenberg. About a week after the closing the lender
rescinded the loan and demanded the funds be returned. Even though checks totaling $13.457.28
relating to the Stauffenberg loan had cleared the trust account, I returned the entire loan amount to
the lender. This caused a defalcation in my tryst account of $13,457.28. Stauffenberg refused to
repay the trust account. Although I have received fees that could have been used to replace at least
part of the funds misappropriated. 1 have not replaced any of these funds. [ chose to use fees
received for business and personal purposes.
2) On January 5, 2001, 1 closed a loan for Jeffrey Frierson. Due to my error. 1 disbursed to
the seller over $4,800 more than he should have received causing an additional defalcation in my
trust account. I have not made any attempt to recover these funds from the seller and have not
replaced them in my trust account. Although I have received fees that could have been used to
replace at least part of the funds misappropriated, [ chose to use fees received for business and
personal purposes.
3) 1 have failed to keep adequate and accurate records of my trust account transactions, as
required by the Rules of Professional Conduct. As a result in numerous instances I have failed to
disburse all closing funds received on behalf of clients. Presently. there is not enough money in my
trust accOlmt for all money owed to or on behalf of clients.
4) [ have fully coopcrated in the investigation by the State Bar.

-.

1 acknowledge that the material facts set forth in paragraphs 1 through 4 are true. 1 am
submitting my resignation because I know that if charges were predicated upon the misconduct
under investigation I could not successfully defend against them.
