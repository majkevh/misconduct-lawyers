Marty Steven McConchie, being first duly sworn, deposes and says as follows:

1.

I desire to resign and hereby tender my license to practice law in North Carolina.

2.
My resignation is freely and voluntarily rendered, and is not the result of coercion or
duress. I am fully aware of the implications of submitting my resignation.

3.
I am aware that there is a pending investigation by the State Bar regarding allegations
that I misappropriated approximately $1,275.13 of entrusted client funds.

4.

I acknowledge that the material facts upon which the investigation is predicated are

true.
5.
I am submitting my resignation because I know that if disciplinary charges were
predicated upon the misconduct under investigation, I could not successfully defend against them.
