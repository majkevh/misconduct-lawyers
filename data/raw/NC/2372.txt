A reprimand is a written form of discipline more serious than ali admonition issued in
cases in which a:n attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Rllies of Professional
Cond uct and has caused harm or potential harm to a client, the administration of justice, the
profession, or a ~lember of the public, but the misconduct does not require a censure.
The Grievance Committee was ofthe opinion that a censure is not required in this case
and issues this ff1pl;mand to you. As chairman of the Grievance Committee ofthe North
Carolina State Bar, it is now my duty to issue thl;: '~'~6;:)rimand, and I am certain that you will
understand fully the spirit in which, this duty is ,perfoimed•

.In 2002, }'OU agreed to represent Karen,and jeffrey Krull in a Chapter 13 bankiuptcy

The Grievance Committee found tha~ the delay in preparing and filing the Krulls.' Chapter
13 bankruptcy action was unreasonable and in violation ofR1-l1e'.1.3 of the Revised Rules of
Professional Conduct.
. ",."
.
Prior to y~)Ur representation of the Krulls in their Chapter 13 action, the Krulls hired YOll
in August 2001 to assist them with iheir tax problems. At the time you agreed to represent the
Krulls in their lJankruptcy case, the K.r411s owed you approximately $4, 650.00 in attorney's fees.
Furthermore, at the time' that the bankruptcy petition was filed on behalf of the Krulls; they owed
you approximately $3;700.00 in attorney's fees. Since the Krulls owed you money fQr attorney's
fees, you were considered a creditor of the Krulls. The Grievance Committee found that you had
a conflict of interest in violation of Rule 1.7, as you were a creditor representing debtors in their
bankruptcy action: There is no evidence that you waived the prior attorney's fees in the tax case,
'before agreeing to represent the Klulls in the bankrup~cy case.
.

I

'i-

The Griev.ance Committee was also concerned about the arrangement you had with the
Krulls to pay your attorney's fee in their tax case outside of the Chapter 13 bankruptcy action.
You did not disclose to the bankruptcy court that the Krulls owed you attorney's fees for
. representing them. in their tax case. It could be argued that .the Krulls committed perjury when
. :~ they signed the bankruptcy petition and stated under penalty of law that they had discfosed all
. their debts. You also signed the petition, as the Krulls' attorney, indicating that all of their debts
had been disclosed to the court. The Grievance Cortunittee found that your conduct in this regard
: violated Rule 3.3(a)(1) and (3), Rule 8.4(c) and (d).

.

';.,

.

,

You charged the Krulls by the hour for your representation in the bankruptcy case. Your
...:. attorney's fee in the bankruptcy case totaled approximately $7,479.28. You did not list these fees
. :....! on the ba¥ruptcy petition that you filed on behalf of the Krulls. In a letter dated NQveml?er 12,
'
2002 from John F.·Logan, the standing tru$tee.ofthe Chapter 13 office, he specifically asked for
a, statement of attorney's fees. The trustee eyen asked if you were handling the matter pro bono.

I

The standard base fee for a Chapter 13 action in the Eastem District bfNorth Carolina is
$1,400.00. This base fee includes time spent counseling the clients as to whether to file
bankruptcy, the bankruptcy chapter to file under, preparation of the petition, and also any
research time required to prepare the petition. The Grievance Committee foUnd that the
$7,400.00 you charged the Krulls for the bankruptcy case violates Rule l.S(a) in that the fee
charged was either illegal or clearly excessive.

The committee noted that Mr. Logan's November 12, 2002 letter to you pointed out
numerous deficiencies with the Krulls' Chapter 13 filing.' In fact, the Chapter 13 officetru$tee
threatened to mo'~e for dismissal of the plan due to "plan ipfeasibility, failure to file schedules, '
incomplete schedules, and discrepancies in schedules.''- TIwcommittee believed that your failure
to file a complete Chapter 1~ petition violated Rule 1.3 ofthe Revised RU~l;ls of Professional
Conduct.

You are hereby rl;lprimanded by the North Catolina State Bar for your professional
misconduct. , The Qrievance Committee trusts that you will heed this reprim~d, that it will be
