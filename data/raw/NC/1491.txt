A meeting to consummate the settlement wa~ scheduled on November 18,
Present at the meeting in addition to yourself
were Hodges, Taylor, Rader and Leroy Frailey, a man to whom the McGovern note'
and deed of trust had pu,tportedly been assigned by Rader. At the meeting you
a~ked Hod,ges for permission to examine the Mc;Govern note and deed of trust
prior to concluding the settlement, presumably for the purpose of ascertaining
authenticity of the documeQ,ts and the validity of any assignment. As an
,apparent expression of your good faith and that of your client, you handed
Hod~es your client's check in the amount of ,$40,000 which had been signed but
which was blank as to the payee. After you handed .Hodges the check, she
hande4 you the McGovern note and dee'd of trust for your examination. You
scruti'nized the documents for a few mOments and then left t:he office along
.~th your ci:L,ent witb.out giving any explanation to Hodges or her client.
After leaving Hodges' office you met a ,deputy sheriff in the hall whose
presence you had ef'ther arranged or foreseen and handed the McGovern note and
deed of ·trustover to the de'puty sheriff so that the documents might be
attached. When Hodges asked for an explanation of your conduct and exhibited
your client's checlt, 'you took the check from her and tore it into pieces.
Immediately thereaf,~er, you .~rranged for th~ ,c;1eputy sher,Hf 'to serve a
cross-c:'I,.aim up.on Rader which you had previously prepared.

1986, in Hodges' law office.

it was apparent to the Grievance Committee that 'you abused the confidence
and trust of a fellow attorney in t.his .situation by surrendering to the
depu,tysherif£ d.Qcument$ ,Which w~re en~t1.lsted t'P you for the sole purpose of
permit·t:f;:ng 'yo~ ,to ~xaminethem on bella1f 'of yOtircl~en.t,.Yout conduct was
un4ert~ke~ ,dellbe1"at~;t:y and. with fu~l awat~ness of the limited 'scope

R~~e 1.2-(C) of the Rules of P.roiessioQ,31 Conduct prohibits conduct

I

I

involving di'shones,ty, £ri:11.ld, deceit andmisrepresen'tlil'tiQn. Your actions in
this s!,tuat'ion violated both the letter and the spirft ·of that rule,.
In order for the Bar to effectively serve its clients and the
adminis;tration of justice it is absol'utely n!'!c,:essary that its members be able
to tr,tlst one another·. Your conduct in this matter was cOmpletely inconsistent
with that notion and seriously compromised your ability to deal effectively
w:J.th othe.r members ·of t.he Bar who ha,,!'! and will ,become aware of your bad
faith. It is no '~o~~,t ~,lso '1:+,ue 1;hAt ypur ,miscond4ct tended to cast' .the
ent1.re pr,ofess:J;onin ,d!sr~pute :fl,nd cou1:·:r:i:'buted in soine ttleasut:e to ,diininish,ing
pub'lic c'OD.~i'dence .in tbe Bar.
In the Committee's judgment, it is no excuse that the action you took
might have been in your client' sbes·t interest. While a 14,wyer has an
obligation to serve his cllEmt' s interest with zeal, he is never justified in
employing means which are de.ceitful. Likewise, the fac·t that your actions in
this matter may have facii:.{.tat.ed the ·sheriff's w.ork is no excuse for your
conduct. A lawyer is nev~r required to or justif-ied. in subordinating his
personal i~tegrity to any objective of the State.

i '

The Committee is confident that this Public Censure win be heeded by
you, that it will be remembered by you, and that it will be beneficial' to
you. The Committee is confident that you will never ag/iiin allow yourself to
depart from strict adheren(:eto the 'highest standards of th!'! profession.
