In re:

MATTHEW A. MARINO,
Attorney at Law

ORDER

An Order of Interim Suspension suspending the law license of Matthew A.
Marino ("Marino") pursuant to 27 N.C. Admin. Code Chapter I, Subchapter B, Rule
.0115(d) of the Discipline & Disability Rules of the North Carolina State Bar was filed in
this case on November 13, 2008. The State Bar has not filed a complaint in this DHC
case. Subsequently, Marino filed an affidavit surrendering his law lieense before the
Council of the State Bar. The Council considered Marino's affidavit of surrender at its
meeting on July 24,2009. Marino's affidavit was accepted and an Order of Disbarment
was entered on that date.
The Order of Disbarment renders this DHC case moot and therefore it is hereby
ORDERED that the Interim Suspension previously imposed in this case is terminated and
this disciplinary proceeding is discontinued and now closed.
This the 13th day of August, 2009.
