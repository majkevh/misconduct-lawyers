MARY MARCH EXUM, Attomey,
Defendant

Plaintiff, complaining of Defendant, alleges and says:
1.
Plaintiff, the NOlih Carolina State Bar ("State Bar"), is a body duly organized
under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this proceeding under the
authority granted it in Chapter 84 ofthe General Statutes ofNolih Carolina, and the Rules and
Regulations of the NOlih Carolina State Bar (Chapter 1 of Title 27 of the NOlih Carolina
Administrative Code).
2.

Prior to July 12,2017, Defendant was engaged in the practice oflaw in the State
ofNOlih Carolina and maintained a law office in Asheville, Buncombe County, North Carolina.
4.
On June 12, 2017 the Disciplinary Hearing Commission suspended Defendant's
license to practice law in North Carolina for five years. The suspension became effective on July
12,2017.
Upon information and belief:
5.
In anticipation ofthe suspension of hel' license and/or after the effective date of
the Order suspending her license, Defendant held out to others as able to provide them with legal
services by sending communications on letterhead in the name of "Exum Consultants," an entity
she alleged could provide others with "Legal Services, Wealth Management & Intemational
Trading."
6.
In anticipation ofthe suspension of her license and/or after the effective date of
the Order suspending her license, Defendant stated on networking and/or referral websites
1

Linkedln.com and AVVO.com that Defendant opened a consulting firm called Exum
Consultants that provides legal services to clients.
7.
On July 12,2017, the effective date of the suspension of her license, Defendant
represented multiple clients for whom she had agreed to provide legal services 01' initiate legal
action once the clients paid a designated amount toward Defendant's total fees.
8.
As of July 12,2017, some of those clients had paid money toward Defendant's
fees but had not yet paid the designated amount at which Defendant had agreed to provide
specific services or initiate legal action on their behalf.
9.
Instead of refunding the money paid by the clients for whom she was no longer
pelmitted by law to provide legal services, Defendant infOlmed her clients she could continue to
provide legal services to them through her consulting firm called Exum Consultants.
10.
Defendant told her former clients that if they chose to continue representation
through Exum Consultants, they could do so under the same fee arrangement as before, receive
credit for the money already paid, and continue to pay to Defendant money that would be applied
toward fees for services to be provided by Exum Consultants.

Through Exum Consultants, Defendant offered to her former clients and to the
public to provide legal services by attorneys she would hire, pay and supervise.
12.
N.C. Gen. Stat. §84-4 states that "it shall be unlawful for any person 01'
association of persons, except active members of the Bar of the State ofNOlth Carolina admitted
and licensed to practice ... to prepare legal documents ... 01' to hold out himself, 01' themselves,
