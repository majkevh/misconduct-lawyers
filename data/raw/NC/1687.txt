,Pursuant to section 13(A) of artic;Le IX of the Rules and
Regu~ations of the North Carolina state Bar, the Grievanoe
Commlttee conducted a preliminary hearing. After cons~dering the

, ' I ',' ,"
The rules provide that after a finding of probable cause, the
Grievance Committee, may determine that the filing, of a c0mplai·nt. '
and a 'hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing com~is~i6n ar.not
required and the GrievanceCom~ittee may issue various lev~l~s p,i
'discipline depending upon the misconduct, the actual or, potentiaJ,:
injury caused, and any aggl;'avating or mitigating fa6tors,. T.lle'"
Grievance Committee may issue an admonition, repri.mand, or
censure to the respondent attorney.
'
" A reprim~nd is a written form 'of discipline m~re serious t:ha~an,"
'admQrrition issued 'in caSeS in which an attorney has vio,1;g.t,eqbf.u:~,<" '
or mOre provisions of the Rules of Professional 'CQnduct and ha.;s' ' '
caused harm or potential harm to a client, the adminis:t:lr~,t.ion:Qf
justice, the profession, or a member of the publ.ic, ,J;iut the ;'
misconduct does not require a censure.

is not necess~ry for'me to settle the record on appeal by

with the appellate division"; that despite receiving, this, " .

The, Committee determined that this conduct violated Rule 6(B) (3)
of the Rules of Professional Conduct which states that "a lawyer
. 'shall act ~ith reasonable diligence and promptness in
representing 'the client", and Rule 1. 2 (C) which states that "it
is professional mi$conduct for a lawyer to engage in condudt
inv'ol ving dishonesty, fraud , deceit or misrepresentation. ,II
The 'Committee,t"ounq. as an aggravating fq.ctor the Letter of
Warning isSued to you on June 27, 1992 for similar misconduct
concerning your representation of Calvin k~arny, Jr.

As stated in the cQmment to Rule 6, perhaps no professional
shortcoming is more widely resented than procrastination. A
cliertt's inte!."ests often can be adversely affected by the passage
of time or the cha~ge of conditions. Unreasonable delay can also
cauSe a client needless anxiety and undermine confidence in the
lawyer's trust~6rtniness.

I

You are hereby reprimanded by the North Carolina state Bar due t6
your professional misconduct. The Grievance.committee trusts
that you will heed this reprimand, that it will be remembered by
you, that it will be beneficial to you, and that you will never

standards of the legal profession.
