Referr.al service distributed brochures or leafi-ets at various
locations and that the' serVice adver.tised in the· Y~ilow Pages of
the local, telephone directory and the Black P~ges, a pUblication "
widely: disseminated througqout the black business community in

8. Between June 1990 and June 1991, when Deferidant was
associated :with CRS, non-attorney employees of'C,RS contacted

REPRIMAND

This Reprimand is delivered to you pursuant to section 23A 'of
Art. lX' of the Rules and Regulations of' th~ North Carolina $,tat,e
Bar as ordered by a Hearing Committee o! the Dipciplinary H~aring
commission.
:rn approximately June 1990, you were contacted by a'
non-attorney named Anthony King. King tol,d you. that he had a
l~wyer referral service business called Charlotte'Referral
,
Service. King further indicated that Charlotte Referra.l Service
had among 'its c~ients individuals who had,b~eninvolveg in
.
automobile accidents and who needed legal representatipn.· King
offered to refer pote,ntial clients· to you in return for a f~e. '

I

Aiter some ,negotiations with ~ing, yo~ agreed to pay CRS~lbO
for each client referred to you, by CRS and whom you agreed to
'
,represent. The fee paid by you to CRS was not based upon CRS'
administrative ¢osts. 'pursuant to Rule 2.2(C) of the RuIes of
Professional Conduct an attorney ,may not pay any amo~nt to an
individua,l or entity fo~, recommending the lawyer's servic~s. A
lawyer may only pay as compensation to"a private lawyer ~eferral,
se;rvice amounts which represent the administrativ~ costs 'of the
service. The fee which you paid was not related to' CRS"
.
administrative costs and therefore represented a payment to c~S
>, for recommending yom;o' services.
Your conduct in, this rega,rd
"violated Rule 2.2 (C) of the Rules of Pro~essional Conduct.
In your initial meeting with King in June 19~0, Kih'g told yoti
that he had sub,stantial contacts in the black communi tyin
Charlotte, through his church and busine9s activities., He ~lS9
·told'You that CRSc6ntacted potential clients by distributing
leaflets at commercial. laundries and other locations ahd by
.advertising in the Yellow Pages and th~ Black Pages.
King did not tell you, however, that employees,of CR$ also
contacted potential clients by telephoning individuals who had

" business .cards tq individuals at accident scenes. '
,

'

"Rule 2.2 provides tpat an attorney may not participate in a
referl;:'al. serVice whqse employees engage in in-person solicitation
ofpotentia1 clients. By participating in a lawyer referral
"service whose employees and/or agents engaged in in-person
,
solicitation of prospective clients, you violated Rule 2.2(0)(4),
of the Rules of Professional Conduct.
.

.1

Althoug~ you were apparently unaware that CRS' employees were
engaging inin~person solicitation of potential c~ients, Rule
2.2 (C) ~xpres;sly provides tha.t lawyers who participate in a
referral se~ic~ are professionally responsible for the operation
of ..the service,. This responsibility attaches regardless of
whether the lawyer has; actual knowledge of viola,tions committed
by non-attorney employees of the referral service.
In June 1991 , two of your fellow 'attorneys told you that CRS
. might be contacting clients in person .or by telephone. This was
the first time you had heard a question raised about the way CRS
was contacting clients. It is to your credit that you
immediately terminated you~ association with CRS and did not
accept any qther client referrals from CRS. TneHearing
Committee i~ confident that you now understand your ,obligation
regarding ~awyer referl;:'al services and that, in the future, you
will be more car-eful regarding the selection of any referral
service·with which you associate yourself.
1

The Hearing Committee found in mitigation of your conduct in
this matter :tha·t none of the clients who testified at the
disciplinary hearing of this matter had any complaint about your
services and that there was no evidence that any client referred
to you by CRS was harmed in arty way.

I

You are hereby reprimanded by the North Carolina state Bar
for you:!;" viC?latio.ns of the R,ules of Professional Conduct set Qut
above. The Disciplinary Hearing committee trusts that this
reprimand will be heeded by you, that ~t will be remembered by
you and that it will be beneficial to you and other members of
the bar., This Committee trusts that you will'never again allow
yourself to depart frqm the adherence to the h;i.gh ethical
standards of the legal profession. To remain a respected member
of the legal profession'whose conduct can be relied upon without
que'stion, you must in the future carefully weigh your
'
responsibility to the public, your clients and your fellow
attorneys. :The Disciplinary Hearing Committee expects that no
professiona~ misconduct will occur in the 'future:
