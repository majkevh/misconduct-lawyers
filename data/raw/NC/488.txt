follows:

22 To the best of my knowledge ilnd belief. the statements, representations and declarations made by the Defendant in this

each count. I have discussed with the Defendant the facts and circumstances about the charges and any lesser included offenses. f have
explained to the Defendant the possible penalties to which s/he may be subjected as a result ofthis plea. (Initial the paragraph that applies.)
a.

I believe the Defendant and J arc fully informed on all such matters. I have fully investigated this case and illl
witnesses for and against the Defendant (including alibi witnesses ifnny were revealed to me). I have discus.'icd
with the Defendant the defenses available to him/her and motions thnt might be filed on the Defendant's behal r.

,

Because the Defendant wishes to accept the State's plea offer, with the Defendant's agreement, I have not fully
investigated his/her case or talked to all orthe witnesses.

24. The plctt of guilt Inolo contendere eing entered by the Defendant is in accord with my understanding ofthe facts, the law and
possible defenses. If the Defendan
lve a sentence of incarceration, T have not promised the Defendant that s/he will serve il
specific length of time incarcerated. J have made no promises to the Defendant that arc not set forth in this agreementto induce him/hel' [Q
enter this pica, nor have I threatened, coerced or intimidated the Defenuunt in nny way to indncc himlhcr to enter this plea.

25. Huving discLlssed this matter fully with the Defendant, it is my opinion that s/he is mentally and physically competent, ami
there is no mental or physical condition which would affect his/her understl.lnding ofthe5c proceedings. I have no rcaSf)n to believe that s/hc
i:; under the influence of drugs or alcohol at this time. The exceptions to this arc listed in Paragraph 8.
26. I have ex.plained to the Defendant the difference between a direct appeal and a coi!ateral attack upon his/her conviction. J havC'
