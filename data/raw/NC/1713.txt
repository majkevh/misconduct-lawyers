mitigating factors. The Grievance Cornrrtittee may issue an admonition,

provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct and has caUsed harm or
potential harm to -a client, the aQrnin:j..stration of justice,. the profession, or

with 'the North carolina state Bar. Although the ,conduct that Schneid~and
Wallace complained about did not warrant discipline, the Grievance cammittee
hOW reprimands you about the manner in which you responded to these,
,
cfrievances. With respect to the SChneiders grievance, you failed 't9 respond
to the letter of Notice' within 15 days of receiving it. You were sent a '
letter dated Sep~ 25, 1992 which required you to provide a respQI1$e on or
before October 5, 1992. You failed to ~pond to this follow-up letter. A

Your failure to resporxi to th,e letters of Notice in the 'SChneiders' and·
WC:\llace grievances is a violation of Rule 1.1 (B)' of the Rules of Professional

failure to answer a fonnal inquily of the North carolina, state Bc;lr is
'
misconduct for which discipline is appropriate.
You have an 'obligation as an licensed attorney in thi$ state to respond,
, promptly to inquiries from the State Bar regarding allegations of professional
misconduct. Your obligation to respond to the North ·carolina Sta,te Bar flowS
from the state Bar's obligation to regulate its members cU1d protect. the
public. '!he state Bar can only successfully engage' in thi~ self-regulation "
when lawyers cooperate with the ruies with respect to theinvestigatioI1of
disci~liI1ary complaints.
