. 6. By Dec. 20, 1990, Friendelearned that the Bowman Gray
School· of Medicine; Department of Clinics had filed a claim
~gainst the Saunders estate for ari additional $6,028.94
in October, 1990.
7. Bowman Gray did not serve a copy of its claim upon
Friende al th'ough a, copy was sent to the Clerk of Court of Forsyth
County.
8.
Friende ihformed' GilJl10re in late December 1990 that the
Bowman G.ray claim would hav'e to be resoi ved, as the Saunders
estate was solvent and the Bowman Gray claim was timely.
_, .----,
Friende offered'to try to negotiate a settlement of the Bowman, .. ,-,
Gray claim for a lesser amount.

I'

9. On Dec. 28, 1990, after receiving Gilmore's permission to
try to settle the cla'im, Friende called Angela Kellam, an estate
coul1selor in Bowma,n Gray's Patient Accounts'Serv.ices'Department,
and offered to settle the S~unde~s bill for $2,000.
10.
During th~ Dec. '28, 1990 conversation, Kellam told
Friende that she wbuld have to check with her supervisor
regarding the $2,000 settlement offer. Neither Kellam nor
Friende ever discussed settling the clai~ for any sum other than
$2,000.
11. On Jan.2~ 1991 or Jan. 3, 1991 j Kellam telephoned
Friende and accepted the $2,000 offer to settle the Bowman Gray
claim against the SaunderS estate.
Friend~ asked Kellam to send
him a letter conf~rming that the matter had been settled.
12. On Jan. 3, 1991, Kellam wrote-to Friende, confirmipg
that Bowman Gray had. agreed to settle the claim against the
Saunders estate fo+ $2,000.
13. On Jan. 2 or 3, 1991, Friende telephoned Gilmore and
told her that Bowman Gray had agreed to settle the claim for
$3, 000. ';-At:'· the time of the telephone call, Friende knew that the
claim had actually been settled for $'2,000.

I'

14. On Jan. 4, 1991, Gilmore delivered a chepk for $3,000 to
rriende's office t?pay the Bowman Gray qlaim against the
Saunders estate.
15. On Jan. 4, 1991 Gilmore's $3,000,check was deposited
into Friende's attorney trust account.
16. On Jan. 7, 1991, Friende issued a $2,000 trust account
check to Bowman Gray in payment of the Saunders ~state debt.
17. On Jan. 7, 1991, Friende's secretary, Dorothy Williams,
transferred the remaining $1,000 which had been received from
Gilmore into Friende's general office account. Williams
transferred the money because she believed the money represented
Friende's fee.

18. Between Jan. 4 and jan. 9, 1991, Miriam ,cI~mons, another
secretary employed by Friende, altered a'copy of Kellam's letter
of Jan. 3, 1991 to, indicate that the Bowman Gray claim·~ad been
settled for $3,000.
f

~ ~

19. Clemons altered th~'letter beca-use she believed thqt the
figure $2,000 in th~original ietter from Kellam was, a
typographical ~rror.
Friende did not direct Clemons' to alter the
letter, nor did Clemons immediately notify him that she had
altered the letter. !

Clemons ma:i\E?d a copy of the altered letter ~b Gilmore., ,." ~-'

2l. On Jan. 9, 1991, Gilmore telephoned ~ellam and learn$d
that Bowman Gray had settled the debt against Saunders' estate
for $2,000.
22.
In a telephone conversation with Gilmore on Jan. 9,
1991, Friende agreed to return the entire $1,000 to Gilmore~
23. Gilmore received the $1,000 from Friende shortly after
jan. 9" 1991 .
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Committee
makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. ,By falsely telling Gilmore that Bowman Gray had agreed to
settle the claim aga~nst the Saunders estate fbr'$3,OOO when
Friende knew that that Bowman Gray's representatives ~ad agreed
to accept $2,000, Friende engaged in conduct involv.ing'
'dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresent·ation, 'in viola·tion of
Rule 1.2(C) of the Rules of Professional Conduct and knowingly
made a false statement of fact in violation of R\lle 7.4 (A)'( 4) of
the Rules:'of Professional Conduct.

I

2. The N.C. State Bar has failed to prove by clear, 9 6 g ent
and convincing evidence tl1at Friende violated any o,ther
provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct.'
Signed by the chairman with the consent of all part;i.,es an¢!,
