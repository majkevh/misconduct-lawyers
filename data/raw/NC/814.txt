By 2008,

KINLAW had assumed control of the business

operations of Group Eight, Ltd., Parnell-Kinlaw Group, Inc., Kinlaw
Investment Company, Inc., and Hurst-Law Group, Inc.

After assuming

control of these entities, KINLAW used them to fund his real estate
development projects and other personal interests in the Onslow
County area.
11.

Beginning at a time unknown, but no later than January of

2011, and continuing to a time unknown, but no earlier than April
of 2013, KINLAW used Group Eight, Ltd., Parnell-Kinlaw Group, Inc.,
Maclaw Group, Inc., and Kinlaw Investment Company, Inc., to defraud
BB&T and First Citizens Bank on multiple loans.

KINLAW committed

3

Case 7:16-cr-00047-BO Document 1 Filed 04/26/16 Page 3 of 10

the fraud in two ways:
(A)

False Legal Descriptions of Collateral.

When extending

loans to the entities and investors referenced in this Criminal
Information, BB&T and First Citizens Bank required security for the
debt.

Specifically, BB&T and First Citizens Bank required a Deed

of Trust on the real estate that was the sUbject of the development
loan.

The purpose of the Deed of Trust was to provide First Citizens

Bank and BB&T recourse in the event of default on a loan.

BB&T and

First Citizens Bank relied upon KINLAW, as a licensed attorney, to
draft the Deeds of Trust,

Instead of providing the accurate legal

_ . __ ._g(3jlS!:t;j,IltiolLOJ__ th~.Qol:Lateral
for the loans, KINLAW substituted
a
._- - . --_._-_._--_._--..--------- - --

-~~-.--

legal description of unrelated real estate of a substantially lesser
value. In some instances, the false legal descriptions related to
unimproved swampland instead of improved residential real estate.
These false legal descriptions were material because when entities
and individuals defaulted on loans, the collateral for the loans was
worth only a fraction of the disbursed loan proceeds.

By drafting

a false legal description of the property in the deed of trust, KINLAW
was able to use the cOllateral for other real estate investment
activities and loans.
(B)

Unauthorized Release of Collateral By Deed.

In many

instances, after loan proceeds had already been disbursed to one of
KINLAW's entities or investors,

but before the loans had been
4

~

satisfied, KINLAW drafted and filed fraudulent and unauthorized
deeds conveying rights to collateral belonging to BB&T and First
Citizens Bank to entities controlled by KINLAW, such as Hurst-Law
Group, Inc.

In some instances, KINLAW then conveyed the properties

to third parties for value.

In other instances, KINLAW conveyed the

properties back to himself, to other investors, or other entities.
On certain loans from First Citizens Bank, KINLAW further drafted
fraudulent satisfactions of liens to make it appear that the bank's
loan had been paid off when, in fact,

it had not.

All of these

fraudulent actions were material to BB&T and First Citizens Bank
because, ..in
the event of default, BB&T and First
Citizens Bank
no

~

longer had good. title to the collateral for their loans.

By

fraudulently releasing the banks' collateral before the banks' loans
had been satisfied, KINLAW was able, in several instances, to convey
the collateral to third parties for value and further perpetuate the
scheme.
12.

To perpetuate the scheme and prevent its discovery, KINLAW

used outside funds,

that is, funds unrelated to the real estate

development activity that was the subject of each loan, to make
ongoing loan interest payments to BB&T and First Citizens Bank.

In

some instances, KINLAW used loan proceeds on one transaction to make
loan interest payments on another transaction.

In other instances,

KINLAW fraudulently extracted funds from other investors and their
