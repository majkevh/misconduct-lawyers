AFFIDAVIT

To:

The Council of the North Carolina State Bar

I, Ronald Kent Campbell, hereby tender my license to practice and desire to

resign from the North Carolina State Bar. My resignation is tendered freely and

voluntarily, is not the result of coercion or duress, and I am fully aware of the

implications of submitting the resignation.

I am aware that there are presently pending investigations or other proceedings

regarding allegations that I have been guilty of misconduct, to wit:


Misappropriating $5,600 in funds from the Brian Alston trust.
I acknowledge that the material facts upon which the complaints are predicated
are true. I am submitting my resignation because I know that if charges were predicated
upon the misconduct currently under investigation I could not successfully defend against
them.

This the 31 day of December, 1997.

Subscribed and sworn before me this the
December, 1997.
