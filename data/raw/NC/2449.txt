FINDINGS OF FACT kEOARbIN'G 'DISCIPLINE
1. Poling;s conduct is aggravated by the following facts:

a) lle was motivated by adisbonest Or selfish motive,
b) He engaged in a pattern of nUseonduct
c) He engaged in mUltiple violations of the Rules of Professional
Conduct.
- .·d) He h~ failed to Jilake
restitution.
He b;3S substantial expenet1ce in the practice of law.

e)

fun

f,PoiiIig;s miscond,uct is mitigated by the fact that he has .no prior discipline.

I

~. The aggravating factorS substmitia1ly outweIgh the mitigating factors.

4. Poling's· miscond.uct has caused significant harm to his clients and members of

the public.

.

5. PoJh1g;s miSConduct bas al~ hatmed the standing of the legal profession by
undetllli'bing trust anu confidence in laWye~ and the legai system.
~. Disbatm:ent is· the only sanction that cau adequately protect the public for the
foil6Wm:¢ reasons:
'
.
(a) Ai1arder of discipline less than disbarment would Dot sUfficiently protect tbe
public because POling committed Itlisdeedsinvolvmg moral turpitude and
violations· ofthe public trust.
(b) Entry of an order jmposing Jesserdisciplme would fail to acknowledge the
~rio1iSt1ess of the offenses that Poling colfimitted and would send the wtong
~essase toattomeys and the pUblic regarding the conduct expecte!J ofmembets
of the Bar in North Carolii1a..
.
(c) the protection of the public requires that Polii1g not be permitted to resmne
'the practice of law unless and until he demonstrates that he has refotined, that he
un:rletstands his obJigations to his cliemts~ the public, the courts and the legal
profession, and that tei.nstakmlent would not· injure the Standing of the legal
profession. 'Disbarred attorneys must show refOilIiation amohg other things,
before they may reswne the pt~ctit:e of law~ Wliereas no s1)ch showing of
reformation is required of attorneys whose Hcenses aresuspe.ttded fot a term
