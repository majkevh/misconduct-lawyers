Bryan, and the sellers, J. W. Robinson and his wife, Lillian Robinson,
and A. H. Gainey, Jr. The Robinsons and Gainey were charged a $35.00
closing f,ee for the preparation of the settlement statement, the
preparation of a 1099-B forin, and for the disbursement of funds to the
parties.

I'··

,

5.
At the time of the real estate closing, Mark Lewis and the
defendant practiced law in a partnership known as Ramos and Lewis.
The Ramos and Lewis partnership was formed on April 1, 1984.
6.
At no time during his representation of the parties referred
to above did Lewis. limit his or the law firm's representation to
either the Sellers or th,e purchasers in the closing.·
7.
Lewis prepared a
disburseI:l\ent sheet for the closing
transaction and he instructed his secretary to disburse the funds in
accordance with the disbursement sheet. The Robinsons and Gainey were
due $60,289.71 from the closing transaction.
8.
At LewiS' request, Check number 1595 in the amount of
$60,289.11 was issued from the. Rqmos and Lewis"
trust account on
July 23, 1987 to A. H. Gainey, Jr., J. W. Ropinson and Lillian F.
Robinson. This amount represented the sellers' proceeds from the sale
of the property.
9.
After recordation of the closing documents, the defendant
learned that the law firm had closed a sal.e .of property .in which J. W.
Robinson had some ownership interest.
10. Upon
learning
of
Robinson's . interest,
the
defe:pdant
contacted William F. Fairley, an attorney for Sea Pearl Seafo.od
corporation, rnc. (a creditor of J. W. ~obinson) and advised him that
the law. firm had funds belonging in part to J. W. Robinson in the law
firm's trust apcount.
Sea Pearl Seafoog Corporation, Inc. had a
judgment against J. W. Robinson as docketed in Judgment Docket 12 ,
Page 123 on May 14, ,1984 in the office of the Brunswick County Clerk
of Superior Court and the defenqant had knowledge of that fact.
11. After the closing, qefendant instr'ucted Faith Ramos, an
employeeo,f the law firm; to vqid check number 1595. After the levy
on defendant's trust account by t~e Sheriff's D~partment, Ms. Ramos
issued check number 1596 from the law firm's trust account to the
Brunswi.ck County Clerk of Superior Court on July 23, 1987 in the
amount of $15,072.42.
The name "J. W. Robinson" appears on the
memorandum 'line on this check.
Ms. Ramos issued check number 1597
from the law firm's trust account to A. H. Gainey, Jr. and Lillian F.
Robinson on July 23, 1987 in the amount of $45,217.29.
This check
repr.esented the balance of the proceeds from the sale of property to
Mr. and Mrs·. Jack D. Bryan.
12. As a result of the defendant's communications to Fairley and
Fairley's notification to the Brunswick County Sheriff's Department,
the Sher iff's Department' levied on the defendant's trust account and
seized Robinson's share cf the proceeds from the real estate closing.
Pursuant to the levy by the Sheriff's Depar.tment and :per the

contact the attorney for J. W. Robinson's. creditor and inf.Q~m him b~
J. W. Robinsons' funds being held in.tp.e law firm's trust ac;::eount •.
16.
The defendant was
aware
of
the Sea Pearl
Seafood
Corporation I s judgment against J .W·. Robinson because he had ~q.il.ed to
1i$t this judgment on a title opinion in an earlier, uprelated;clo$ing
of property where J. W. Robinson was a predece$sor in titl$.
When
thi$ omission was brought to defendant I IS attention, (seYera,lweeks
before the Robinsbns and Gainey/Bryan closing), defendant' contacted.
William Fairley, ,Sea Pearl Seafood's attorney, and det.ermined the
amount needed to release his client's p;roperty from Sea Pearl
Segfood's lien.
The defenda'nt and Fa;Lrley agreed upon $5,000.00 and
defendant paid that amount ollt of his pocket.

Sea Pearl Seafood's judgment (inclUding: principa,l, interest,
CO$t and Sheriff's commission) against' J. W. Ro:Qins'on was
$32,460.13 as of July 13, 1987.

By informing the attorney for J. W. :Ro}:)insc;:m's j'udgmeht

This public censure is delivered to y,ou pursu~nt to sect:i.on 23 of
Article IX of the Ru,ies and Regulations of the Nqrth. Carolina . St,ate
. Bar as ordered J:;ly a hearing committee of the Piscdplinaty' Heari,ng
Commission fc;>llow1ng a hearing in the apove-captioned p}to'ceedingon
June 16, 1989.
The hearing committee, foUnd that you hag v;i.olated
certain of the Rules of Professionai Conduct o,f the NQrtll Carolina
state Bar.
dn July 18, 1987, your Partner Ma.rk A. Lewis closed a real·
estate transaction between the purchasers, Mr. and.M~s. dack'O. Bryan,
and the sellers, J. W. Ro]:)inson and his wif~, Lillian Robinson and A.
H. Gainey, jr. Th.e purchasers and the sellers wereeacllchargeg by
and paid your firm a closing fee fo~ the preparation of th.esettlejt\ent
statement, the preparation of al099-B form and for th~disbur~ements .
of funds to the parties. At no time did your partner MEI.1:k, I.;.ew,is limi'\:
his or the law firm f s representation to either the sellers Qr.: the
purchasers in the real estate transaction in que$tiqn~
J

Your partner Mark Lewis prepared a disburs'ement sheet f'or the
closing transaction and he instr'l;lcted his secrc.etary to 'd:i~p~r~e. thea
funds in accordance with the disbursement sheet.
The,se inst.ructions
were in accordance with instructions from the firm'; s client$ ahd.u,hder

;,

an attorney for Sea Pearl Seafood Corporation, Inc. and informed him
that your law firm was holding funds belonging in part to J. W.
Robinson in your law firm's trust account.

I

As a consequence of your informing Mr. Fairley of these facts,
Mr. Fairley notified thel Brunswick County Sheriff's Department and the
Sheriff's Department levied ex~cution op your firm's trust account and
seized Mr. Robinson's share of the proceeqs from the real estate
closing.
As a result, your firm's client J. W. Robinson failed to
receive the $15,072.42 which your firm held in its trust account in
trust for him and hiS funds were not disbursed according to the
settlement statement prep~red by your law partner in accordance with
Mr. Robinson's instructions.
This conduct which yqu have admitted violated numerous prov'l.sl.ons
of the Rules of Proff?ssional conduct. 'In particular, you revealed
confidential information of your client and used the confidential
information of your cli~nt to the disadvantage of your client and to
the adv<;tntage of a third person.
By alerting the attorney for' your
client',s creditor. of yourr client"s funds being held by your la:w firm's
tr~st account and by not. allowing the fUI)ds to be disbursed ac:cording
to the settl.ement statement prepared by your partner, you have
prejudiced your client during the course of the professional
relationship.
You have: failed to payor deliver promptly to your law
firm's client, as directed by your client, funds belonging to him and
to which he was entitled.

1

Just as surely as your actions violated the letter of the
Disciplinary Rules referred to , it also violated the spirit Qf the
Rules of Professional Conduct. Your conduct tended to cast disrepute
upon not only yourself but also upon your f~llow m~mbers of the Bar.

.

The hearing c;:omm~ttee was ultimately persuaded that YOl,lr
misconduct in this C'a$e, was generally the product of neglect. in
failing to realize 'that, Mr. Robinson waS the cli~nt of your firm in
the transaction. Nevertheless, the committee is compelled to observe
that a client who' entrusts his or her property to a lawyer has an
absolute right to expect that the property will be pre'served and
disbursed in accordance w,ith the instructions of the client.
The fact that the hearing committee has chosen to impose the
relati vely moderate sa'nction of public censure should not be taken by
you to indicate that the Disciplinary Hearing Commission in any way
feels that your conduct in this matt'er was excusable. Were it not for
the presence of several signif'icant mitigating circumstances , it is
likeJ,.y that a more Severe disciplinary sanction would have been
imposed. The committee was particularly impressed by your cooperati.on
wi th the S,ta:te Bar wi th its investigation as well as the absence of
<;tny dishonest or selfish motives on your part. We were convinced that
this 'was, an isolated incident and the absence of. a prior record Of
misconduct was a significant factor in our decision.

I'

The North Carolina S'tate Bar is conf ident that this public
censure will be heeded by you, that it will be remembered by you, and

Hopefully you will never again

respon~ibilities to the public; your clients, your fellow attotneys,
