disbar:ment. '
You undertook, to represent ,Keretha Woolard: and her minb~
Child, Germaine, both of FloJ::iq.~, afte~ Ms. Woolard"s husband ,was
killed in a work related accident, in F:j..orida in January, ' 198~.
W;hile you obtained worker's compensation penefits 'for Ms. Woolard,
you failed to thoroughly pursue the correct calculation o~ benefit,s
due her and you faileq to thorougbly pursue apy plaim on behalf of'
the minor child. Your actions,viol~ted Rule 6(A) (2) of the Rules
9£' Professional 'conduct whichpl;"ovides that an attorney shall not
handle a legal, matter without adequate :preparation under the
circumstanCes. '

I

During the 'period in whiCh you represented M.s. Woolard, you
received worker's compensation check!? for Ms. Woolard. Some of the:
checks were placed in her file rather than a trust account and in
fact became stale.
While ,·there 'was no fraud,
deceit or
tniasappropriation o,f client funds on, ~ om:' . part, you:,.- conduct ih
this respect was in violation of'Rul~ 10.1(e) of the North Carolina
Rules o'f Professional Conduct, which,req~ires attorneys to place
funds of a client into a trust 'account. '
It appears that you and MS. Woolard agreed that some of the
checks you were holding should be used to ,pay a funeral home bill,
an autopsy bill arid to reimburse you for expenses incurred in
represepting Ms. Wqolard. Pursual1t:to Florida and North Carolina
law, worker's compensation bepefits': are exempt from tp,e claims of,
.creditoJ::s.
'While you advised l1s. Woolard t;hat she was not
obligated'~o'pay these claims, ,you prejudice~ her, in v~olatidn of
Rule 7.1(A) (3) by failing to advise, her that this' exemption could
not be 'w~ived.' '
.
Ms. Woolard aischarged y.ou ,i~ October 1989 and her new
attorney, James T. Earle, Jr. ~ tpe' comp;J..ainant', asked you for pp
accounting' of the worker's compensation benef its that you had
received in your office on MS. Woo~ard's 'behalf., 1\lthough you may
have had several teJ,.ephone conferences w.j.th Mr. Earle and did in
fact advise him of the checks in her file, as well as forward such
checks to' him on, November 7, 1989, you did not respond to Mr.
Earle's reque,st fo+, an accounting on l1s. Woola,rd's behalf until
early April,' 1990~
Moreover, the acqounting .which you ;tinaL!.y
provided was inacc~rate.
For instance, the acc'ounting mistakenly
indicated that all of the worker's compen'sation checks listed on
the accounting ha~'been promptly relayed to Ms. Woodard when, in
fact; some of the ohecks had b$en deposited in your, trust account
and others' had become st'ale a:fter being, left in the file for a
,period of time.
':Rule 10.2 (D) of the North" Carolina Rules of
Professional Conduct requires ,an attorney to provide accountings
when requested to do So by a 'client. - You violated this rule by
failing to provide a prompt accurate response, to Mr. Earle's
request for an accounting on behalf of Ms. Woolard.
