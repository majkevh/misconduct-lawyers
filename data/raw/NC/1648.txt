Pursuant to section 13 (7) of Article Ix of the Rilles arrl Regulations of
the North carolina state Bar, the ,Grievance Conunittee, after considering the
evidence, :includ~ your' ,response to 'the Letter of Notice, found probable
cause Which is defmed in the rules as "reasonable cause to believe that a
nleItlber of the North ca:p;,lina state Bar 1s guilty of misconduct justifying
disciplinary action."

'!he rules provide that after a firrling of pi;obable cause, the Grievance

, the Disciplinru:y Hearihc] Commission are not requlreci' arrl the Grievance

are not required in this case arrl issues this' Public Reprimand to you., As
chainnan of the Grievance Conunittee of the North carolina State Bar, it is I1CM
my dUty to issue this PI,lblic Reprimand ani I am certain that you will
understand fully the ,spi,rit 'in which this dUty is perfonned. '
A Public Reprimand is a serious fom ,of 'discipline lluposed by the
Grievance committee. '!he Grievance Committee felt that your conduct warranted
pdPlic discipline duetQ your violation of the Rules of Professional Oonduct.
The committee trusts that this miscondUct will not recur.

You represented Cephus McNeil regarcUng drug charges in federal court in
Mr. McNeil was convicted after two trials, the first of which ended in
a mistrial. Aftef t;l1,e 5eC9nd fric;tl, ~eil told you ~t p~ ~ted ,to al?~"
Although you pronused t9 flle notl,ce of appeal, you falled to do so. While
Mr. McNeil later expressed some dissatisfaction with you, you failed to file a
i1ot~ce of withdrawal with th~ Court, to notify the,court of Mr. McNeil's
deslre to appeal arrl to,obtam other counsel for him.
\
1981.

Rule 6(B) (3) of the Rules of Professional Oonduct requires attorneys to
handle ,legal matters entrusted to them with' reasonable diligence. You
, violated this rtile by f~iling to enter a notice of appeal' 0n 'Mr. McNeil's
behalf, or in the alternative; seek a court order allowing you to withdraw as
his attorney before the deadline for filing the apPeal elapsed.
