THIS MATTER was heard by the Council of the North Carolina State Bar pursuant to 27

surrender of license executed by Charles K. Blackmon on January 16,2019 and filed in the offices

dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation that reflects adversely on his fitness as a lawyer in
violation of Rule 8.4( c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. This conduct constitutes grounds
for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28 (b)(2).

Disability Rules.
