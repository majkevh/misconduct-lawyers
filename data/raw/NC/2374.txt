4. There is potential significant harm to the administration of justice, the legal
profession and members of the public wl;1en a iawyer repeatedly fails to file the
accountings and reports required by law and order of the Clerk of Court in a case
in which an attorney has been appointed to serve. as a general guardian Of an
incompetent adult. This potential harm is aggravated when the guardian does not
timely tum over the ward's assets to a successor general guardian. Protection ,of'
the public does warrant suspension of the attorney's license. However, since the
ward's assets Were not misappropriated, disbarment i$ not warranted and th~
staying the suspension is appropriate, provided that the defendant meets the
conditions of the stay.
