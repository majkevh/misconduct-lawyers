Based upon the foregoing Findings or Fact nnd Conclusions of Law and the consent of the
parties, the Hearing Panel also enters the l'oIlO\ving:

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.

'1'he findings of lact in paragraphs I

2.

Defendant has been licensed to practice law fbr more than 35 years.

3.

Defendant has prior professional discipline. He was:

J 08

above are reincorporated as if set forth

herein.

(a) Admonished by the Grievance Committee in October 2006 for lack of diligence

and failure to communicate,
(b) Suspended from practice by the DHC in March 2016 for trust account
mismanagement, misllse of interest on escrowed funds, and dishonest statements,
among other things, and
(c) Reprimanded by the Grievance Committee in July 2016 for failure to
communicate and failure to protect a client's interests upon ,termination.

4.
Defendant's misconduct illvolves repeated failure to participate in the self-regulatory
processes of the profession. Self-regulation of the legal profession depends upon lavvyeJs'
cooperation and participation. Defendant's persistent refusal to n1eaningfully participate in the selfregUlatory process interferes with the State Bar's ability to regulate its members and undermines the
profession's privilege to remain self-regulating.
5.
In mUltiple instances, Defenclant received payment of fees 11'0111 clients, failed to
perform (or complete) the services for which he was hirecl, and did not proniptly refund unearned
fees. In so doing, Defendant elevated his own pecuniary interests above the interests of his clients
and caused foreseeable financial harm to his clients. This course of action impaired the clients'

ability to <1chicYe the goals
motive.

or the

representation and rellccts that Defendant acted with selfish

Defendant's conduct harmecl his clients' perception of the legal profession, making
them less likely to trust I,m'yers in the future due to their e:'\perience v\:lth Defendant.
6.

7.
In early 2016, \\'hen DeJenciant was defending against the prior DHC action and
winding clown his practice. he was also contending with the dissolution of his marriage and a
dispute over child custody. Soon after the 2016 DHC proceeding, he experienced the death of a
sibling. These personal and emotional strcssors contributed to the misconduct described herein.
Defendant has been cooperative with this disciplinary proceeding, and voluntarily
participated in a settlement conference ill an cfTort to resolve this maller.
8.

9.
Defendant uncierstands that he is entitled to counsel and acknO\'vledges that he had an
opportunity to seek counsel. but freely and voluntarily electeci to proceed jJro se and agree to the
terms of this Consent Order or Discipline.

] O.
Defenclant acknowledges and agrees tbal. as a <;:ondilion of this Consent Order of

conduct expected of members of the Bar of this State.
