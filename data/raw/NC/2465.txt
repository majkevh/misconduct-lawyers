REPRIMAND

!'

On April 14, 2005 the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar met and
considered the grievances filed against you regarding your representation ofS. T. and J. I.
Pursuant to Section .0113(a) of the Discipline and Disability Ru1e~ of the North Carolina
State Bar, the Grievance Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the
information available to it, including your response to the letter of notice, the Grievance
Committee found probable cause. Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasohabl~ cause to
believe that a member of the North Carolina State Bar is guilty of misconduct justifying
disciplinary action."

The rules provide that after a finding of probable cause, the Grievance Committee may
determine that the filing of a complaint and a hearing before the Disciplmary Hearing
Commission are not required, and the Grievance Committee may issue various levels of
discipline depending upon the misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any
aggravating or mitigating factors. The Grievance Committee may issue an admonition, a
reprimand, ot a censure to the respondent attorney.
A reprimand is a written form of discipline more serious than an admo~tioh issued in
cases in which an attotney has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional
Conduct and has cau:;ed harm or potential harm to a client, the administration of justice, the
profession, or a member of the public, but the misconduct does ;not require a·cens1.1fe.The Grievance Committee was of the opinion that a censure is not required in this case
and issues this reprimand to you. As chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North
Carolina State Bar, it is now iny duty to issue this reprimand, ~d I am certain that you will
tinderstand fully the spirit in which this duty is performed.
