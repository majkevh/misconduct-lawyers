2. Johnson's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes.
grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28(b)(2) & (3) as follows:

Arbitration Committee, Johnson failed to participate in good faith in non-binding
arbitration of a fee dispute in violation of Revised Rule I.S(f), and.

the grievance initiated for his failure to respond to the Fee Arbitration Committee,
Johnson knowingly failed to respond to a lawful demand for information from a
disciplinary authority in violation of Revised Rule 8. 1(b).
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and the consent
of the parties, the hearing committee hereby makes additional

I

FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE

to respond to a client's grievance and for failing to zealously
represent that client; and
(2) Johnson was reprimanded in November 1992 for failing to
communIcate with a client and for repeatedly failing to respond to
that client's grievance.
b. Substantial experience. in the practice of law
2. Johnson's misconduct is mitigated by the following factors:
a. absence of dishonest or selfish motive;
b. personal or emotional problems: Johnson has suffered several deaths
in his family, whioh in turn have contributed to his depression
mentioned below;
c. cooperative attitude toward the proceedings;
d. character and reputation;
e. mental disability or impairment: Johnson has been diagnosed with and
is curren~ly being treated for recurreht major depression;
f. remorse;
g. remoteness of prior offenses.
3. The aggravating factors do not outweigh the mitigating factors.
