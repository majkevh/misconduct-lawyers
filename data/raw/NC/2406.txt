,
I put the cash payment in an envelope with a notation on the face
that it was to go to bookkeeping. On the envelope I wrote, "It Loye
Bonding Fee $3,700.00 cash, no billirtg number had yet been obtained, any
questions please call me, E.Z." I went to the bookkeeping office and since
no one was there I brought the envelope back and put it in my outbox in
my office. the following morning the envelope was not in my outbox. I
assumed it had been picked up ~d delivered to bookkeeping.

I

21.: The portion of Zotian' sresponse to the grievance quoted above was false.
BA:SED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact, the hearing committee makes the
following:
i

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. All parties are properly before the hearing committee of the Disciplinary Hearing
Commis~io:n and the hearing committee has jurisdiction over Zotian and the subject matter.
i

2. ~otian's conduct, as set out above, constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C.
Gen. Stat. ยง 84..28(a) & (b)(2) in that Zotian violated the Revised Ru1es of Professional COIlduct
as follows: !
(a) ,

By appropriating the fees Zotian received from Loye while an associate with the
finn to his own use in~tead of remitting the fees to the firm, Zotian committed a
criminal act that reflects adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a
lawyer in other respects in violation ofRu1e 8.4(b), and engaged in conduct
involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c);

(b)

By asking Loye to make false statements to the firm about the $3,700.00 fee for
Zotian's benefit, Zotian cOlmseled his client to falsify evidence in violation of Rule
3.4(b) and engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or
misrepresentation in violation ofRu1e 8.4(c);

i

(c):

By making false statements, to the managing partner in the finn about his handling
of the Loye funds, including denying that he had taken the funds for his personal
use, Zotian engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or
misrepresentation in violation ofRu1e 8.4(c);

:

"<f-.

,..~

.,'

I

(d)

I

By making ralse statements to the grievance committee in his November 6,2002
response to the letter of notice, Zotian offered evidence that he knew was false in
violation of Rule 3.3(a)(4); knowingly made a false statement of material fact fu a
disciplinary matter in violation of Rule 8.1; and engaged in conduct involving
dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4{c).

)3ASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the evidence
presented at the hearing and the argUments of counsel, the hearing committee hereby makes the
following:
.
.
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. Zotian's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
(a)

Zotian had a dishonest or selfish motive in taking his firm's funds and in
attempting to get his client to lie to the finn for his own benefit;

(b)

Zotian made false statements to his firm- during its investigation of the Loye
fee;

(c)

Zotian submitted false statements to the State Bar during the dis~pIinary
process;

(d)

Zotian had substantial experience in the practice of law; and

(e)

Zotian's conduct involved :Q1ultiple offens~s.

2. Zotian's misconduct is mitigated by the following factors:

I

(a)

Zotian has no prior disciplinary record;

(b)

Zotian lllade timely reimbursement to the law finn;

(c)

Zotian presented evidence at the hearing of mental health impairment that
may have affected his judgment; 'and

(d)

Zotian expressed remorse during the hearing.

3. The aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The hearing committee specifically finds that Zotian's conduct involves material
misrepresentations, dishonest conduct and misappropriation Qf money belonging to his former law

I

fjnn. The hearing committee believed Zotian's assertion that he did not know why he took the
firm's money and concludes that this isolated incident of misappropriation did not warrant
disbarment.' However, Zotian's attempt to get his client to cover up his misconduct and his false
statements to his firm and to the State Bar warrant a substantial suspension of his ljcense.

2.
Suspension of Zotian' s license is the Dilly sanction that can adequatelY.protect the
public for the following reasons:
I

. (a)
An order of discipline less than suspension would not sufficiently protect
the public because Zotian's .misconduct involved corrunission of misdeeds involving moral
turp~tude and violations of the public trust.

I

Zotian's attempt to have his clieht, Loye, make false statements to the law
firm !about the $3,700.00 fee caused significant harm to his client, the legal profession, and
the ~dministration ofjustice.
(b)

(c)
Zotian's false statements made to the member of the law:firm that.
questioned him about the Loye fee violated the trust and honesty that all officers of the
court owe to each other, causing significant harm to our system ofjurisprudence.
(d)
Zotian's false statements to the Grievance Committee during the
investigation of this matter undenrtines the State Bar's ability to regulate attorneys and
undehnines the privilege of attorneys in this state to remain self-regulating.
i

~
e)
Entry of an order imposing lesser discipline would rail to acknowledge the
seriousness of the offenses that Zotian committed and would send the wrong message to
attorneys and the public regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar in North.
Carolina.
I

(

BAS)ill UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline and the arguments of
counsel, the ltearing committee. hereby enters the following:

I
