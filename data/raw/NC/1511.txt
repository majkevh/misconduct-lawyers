3.

The Defendant'sljudgment in this matter was impaired
and influenced by pressures' frem his per,senal demestic
difficultie~; his increased ~erklead caused by his
having to' assume responsibility fer his father's
easel cad inasmuch as his father, with whem he alene
practiced, wq.s not able to' centiliu~ to' practice at his
fermer capacity due to' his age: and his persenal
physical health, including a diagnesis ef an ey~
diserder presented to' him as likely to'. cause reading
blindness just two. weeks prier to' Defendantis meeting
with his client in this matter.

4.
