Defendant

This matter was heard on 14 March 2008 before a hearing committee of the
Disciplinary Hearing Commission composed of M. Ann Reed, Chair, and members C.
Colon Willoughby, Jr. and Donald G. Willhoit. Carmen K. Hoyme represented Plaintiff,
the North Carolina State Bar. Defendant, Shonna R. Alexander, appeared on her own
behalf. Based upon the pleadings and admissions pursuant to 27 N.C. Admin. Code
Chapter 1, Subchapter B, ยง .0114(f), the Hearing Committee hereby finds by clear,
cogent, and convincing evidence the following
FINDINGS OF FACT

organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this
proceeding under the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North
Carolina, and the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar (Chapter 1 of
Title 27 of the North Carolina Administrative Code).
2.
Defendant, Shonna R. Alexander ("Alexander" or "Defendant"), was
admitted to the North Carolina State Bar in 1999, and is, and was at all times referred to
herein, an attorney at law licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the laws of the
State of North Carolina, the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and
the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct.
3.
During all or part of the relevant periods referred to herein, Alexander was
engaged in the practice of law in the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office
in Winston-Salem, Forsyth County, North Carolina.
4.
Alexander was properly served with process, a hearing in this matter was
set, and the matter came before the hearing committee with due notice to all parties.

5.
Defendant failed to provide discovery in this action and failed to comply
with this Committee's 28 November 2007 Order Compelling Discovery Responses.
6.
On 21 December 2007, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Order of Sanctions, and
on 22 January 2008, the Disciplinary Hearing Commission entered an Order of Sanctions
against Defendant.
7.
The 22 January 2008 Order of Sanctions provided that Defendant's
responsive pleading filed 1 October 2007 was stricken from the record.
8.
Upon Plaintiff's motion, default was entered against Defendant by the
Secretary of the State Bar on 12 February 2008.
9.
On 12 February 2008, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Default Judgment. On
26 February 2008, Default Judgment was entered by the Chair with the consent of the
other Committee members.
10.
The Default Judgment entered findings of fact and conclusions of law and
reserved as the sole issue for hearing what discipline, if any, should be imposed. The
remaining findings of fact in this order recite the findings of fact found by Default
Judgment.

hearing.

Alexander failed to appear on Allen's behalf at the 20 September 2005

28.
Because Alexander was not present, Allen requested that the cases be
continued, and a continuance was granted until 25 October 2005.
29.
Allen made telephone calls and left repeated voicemails for Alexander,
inquiring about the status of his case and Alexander's failure to appear in court on his
behalf.
30.

to Allen's inquiries.
31.
Alexander failed to appear on Allen's behalf at the 25 October 2005
hearing of case numbers 05CR16281 and 05CR17657.
32.
Because Alexander did not appear at the 25 October 2005 hearing, Allen
was charged with failure to appear, and another Order for Arrest was issued.

33.
In early 2006, Allen encountered Alexander at a shopping mall and asked
her why she had failed to represent him and failed to return his telephone calls.
34.
Alexander told Allen that she would "take care of everything" if he came
to her office the following Monday morning.
35.
When Allen went to Alexander's office the following Monday morning,
Alexander was not there.
36.
On 13 April 2006, Allen filed a Petition for Resolution of Disputed Fee
("fee dispute") with the North Carolina State Bar. Allen's fee dispute was assigned file
number 06FD0241.
37.
The State Bar sent a notice of Allen's fee dispute to Alexander's Winston
Salem office on or about 13 April 2006. Alexander received this letter by certified mail
on 24 April 2006.
38.
Alexander was required to respond within fifteen days of receipt of the
notice of fee dispute, as specified in the notice. She failed to respond to the notice within
that time period.
39.
Alexander's response to Allen's fee dispute was received by the State Bar
on 23 May 2006.

In Alexander's response to the fee dispute, she stated that the MAR was
drafted and she was prepared to proceed in representing him.
41.
On or about 23 May 2006, the State Bar fee dispute mediator relayed to
Allen Alexander's offer to resolve his traffic matters. Allen agreed to Alexander's offer
and the mediator left a voice message for Alexander indicating Allen had accepted her
offer to continue the representation.
42.
The State Bar Fee dispute mediator left additional messages for Alexander
on 24 May 2006, 30 May 2006, 2 June 2006, and 6 June 2006. In each message, the
mediator asked Alexander to call back.
43.
Alexander did not return any of these five calls from the State Bar
regarding Allen's fee dispute.
44.
On 7 June 2006, Allen attended a scheduled hearing of case numbers
05CR16281 and 05CR17657.

voice message for Alexander asking her to contact the State Bar.
49.
After Alexander failed to appear at Allen's hearing, Allen went to
Alexander's office. Another tenant in the building informed Allen that Alexander had
not been in her office recently.
50.
On 12 June 2006, the State Bar opened a grievance file against Alexander
for failure to participate in good faith in the fee dispute resolution process concerning
Allen's fee dispute. This grievance was assigned file number 0600639.
51.
The State Bar issued a letter of notice to Alexander on or about 16 June
2006, advising her that a grievance had been filed against her. The letter of notice was
returned marked "unclaimed." The State Bar sent the letter of notice to Alexander again
on 6 July 2006. Again, it was returned marked "unclaimed."
52.
The State Bar sent the letter of notice to Alexander a third time on or
about 1 August 2006. Alexander received the letter of notice regarding the Allen matter
by certified mail on 3 August 2006.
53.
Alexander was required to respond within fifteen days of receipt of the
letter of notice. She failed to respond.

The letter stated that Alexander "is avoiding service and is ignoring all attempts to be
served."

Despite these additional reminders, Alexander failed to respond to the letter of notice in
the Saunders matter.

As previously found in the Default Judgment and now recited herein, based on the
foregoing Findings of Fact the Committee enters the following
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.
All the parties are properly before the Hearing Committee and the
Committee has jurisdiction over Defendant, Shonna R. Alexander, and the subject matter.
2.
Defendant's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes
grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยงยง 84-28(b)(2) and (3) as follows:

(a)

By failing to provide the legal services Allen and Saunders hired her to
perfonn, Alexander failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness
in representing her clients in violation of Rule 1.3;

(b)

By failing to respond to inquiries from Allen and Saunders about their
cases, Alexander failed to keep her clients reasonably informed in
violation of Rule 1.4(a)(3) and failed to comply with reasonable requests
for infonnation in violation of Rule 1.4(a)(4);

(c)

By collecting fees from Allen and Saunders and then failing to provide the
legal representation for which they paid the fees, Alexander collected
clearly excessive fees in violation ofRcle 1.5(a);

(d)

By failing to promptly refund unearned fees upon tennination of the
representation by Saunders, Alexander failed to protect a client's interests
upon termination of the representation in violation of Rule 1.16(d) and
failed to promptly deliver to a client funds belonging to the client in
violation of Rule 1.15-2(m);

(e)

By failing to respond to the State Bar regarding Allen's fee dispute,
Alexander failed to participate in good faith in the fee dispute resolution
process in violation of Rule 1.5(f); and

(f)

By failing to respond to the State Bar's letters of notice and follow-up
letters regarding grievance file numbers 06G0639 and 06G0737,
Alexander failed to respond to lawful inquiries of a disciplinary authority
in violation of Rule 8.1(b) and N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(3).

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and upon the
evidence and arguments presented at the hearing concerning appropriate discipline, the

-7-

Hearing Committee hereby finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following
additional
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.

Alexander's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
a.

Pattern of misconduct;

b.

Multiple offenses;

c.

Bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceedings by
intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the
disciplinary agency; and

d.
2.

Indifference to making restitution.

Alexander's misconduct is mitigated by the following factors:
a.

Absence of a prior disciplinary record;

b.

Personal or emotional problems; and

c.

Physical or mental disability or impairment.

3.
Defendant has engaged in conduct that has caused significant harm to her
clients, in that:
a.
She accepted fees from Saunders and did not provide the legal
services for which the fee was paid, resulting in delay in resolving Saunders' legal
matter.
b.
She accepted fees from Allen and did not provide the legal services
for which the fee was paid. As a result, the relief that Allen sought was
considerably delayed. Allen suffered additional financial harm as a result of
Defendant's conduct, in that he was required to pay a $1,000.00 bond and had to
pay another lawyer $1,350.00 to help him resolve his legal matters.
4.
Defendant's failure to participate in the fee dispute resolution process and
failure to respond to letters of notice from the State Bar regarding grievances results in
potential significant harm to the profession and to the public. The legal profession is
entrusted with the privilege of self-regulation. The State Bar can only regulate the
profession if its members respond to inquiries of the State Bar and otherwise participate
in this self-regulation. Defendant's failure to participate in the self-regulation of the
profession shows an unacceptable disregard for the regulatory authority of the State Bar.
Defendant's failure to participate in the profession's self-regulation impedes effective
self-regulation and jeopardizes the privilege ofthe profession to remain self-regulating.

-8-

5.
Defendant's conduct caused significant harm and potential harm to clients,
to the profession, and to members of the public.
6.
This DHC Hearing Committee has considered lesser alternatives and finds
that a public censure or reprimand would not be sufficient discipline because of the
gravity of the harm caused by the conduct of Defendant to the public, to Defendant's
clients, and to the profession.
7.
An Order imposing discipline short of a suspension of Defendant's law
license would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses, would be inconsistent
with other orders of discipline entered by this body in similar cases, and would send the
wrong message to attorneys regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar.

Based upon the foregoing factors and with the consent of the parties, the Hearing
Committee hereby enters the following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1.
three years.

The license of Defendant, Shonna R. Alexander, is hereby suspended for

2.
Alexander shall submit her license and membership card to the Secretary
of the North Carolina State Bar no later than 30 days following the service of this order
upon Defendant.
3.
Alexander shall comply with the wind down provisions contained in 27
N.C. Admin. Code Chapter 1, Subchapter B, ยง .0124 of the North Carolina State Bar
Discipline and Disability Rules, including but not limited to distributing any client
property, including funds held for clients in her trust account, to her former clients or
initiating appropriate escheat procedures. Defendant shall file an affidavit certifying she
has complied with the wind down rule with the Secretary of the North Carolina State Bar
within 10 days of the effective date of this order.
4.
After serving one year of the active suspension of her license, Defendant
may apply for a stay of the remaining period of suspension upon filing a petition with the
Secretary of the North Carolina State Bar demonstrating by clear, cogent, and convincing
evidence that, in addition to complying with the general provisions for reinstatement

received by the State Bar and paid any refund found appropriate by
the mediator;

f.

Complied with all Continuing Legal Education (CLE)
requirements on a timely basis as if still in practice during the
suspension. The State Bar does not send CLE notices to members
who are suspended, so it is Defendant's obligation to contact the
appropriate department on a timely basis, ascertain her CLE
obligations during her suspension, and timely satisfY those
obligations;

g.

Within three months prior to the filing of the petItion, been
examined, at her own expense, by a board certified psychiatrist
approved by the North Carolina State Bar and obtained a written
report from that psychiatrist setting forth: (a) the findings of the
examination; and (b) the psychiatrist's opinion as to whether
Defendant has any physical or mental condition that could
adversely affect her ability to practice law;

h.

Prior to or at the time of filing her petition, provided a copy of the
psychiatrist's report described in paragraph (e) to the State Bar,
and executed a written release authorizing the examining
psychiatrist to provide medical records to, and communicate with,
the Office of Counsel of the North Carolina State Bar regarding the
evaluation and report;

1.

Refunded the $1,200.00 in fees paid to her by Kevin D. Allen; and

J.

Refunded the $445.00 in fees paid to her by Robert L. Saunders.

5.
If Defendant successfully seeks a stay of the suspension of her law license,
such stay will continue in force only as long as she complies with the following
conditions:

- 10-

a.

Respond to all letters of notice and requests for information from
the North Carolina State Bar by the deadlines stated in each

f.

Not violate any provision of the Rules of Professional Conduct.

6.
If an order staying any period of this suspension is entered and Defendant
fails to comply with anyone or more of the conditions referenced in Paragraph 5, then
the stay of the suspension of her law license may be lifted as provided in ยง .OII4(x) of
the North Carolina State Bar Discipline and Disability Rules.
7.
If Defendant does not seek a stay of the active portion of the suspension of
her law license or if some part of the suspension is stayed and thereafter the stay is
revoked, Defendant must comply with the conditions set out in paragraphs 4 (a) - (j)
above and the provisions of 27 N.C. Admin. Code Chapter 1, Subchapter B, ยง .0125
before seeking reinstatement of her license to practice law, and must provide in her
application for reinstatement clear, cogent, and convincing evidence showing her
compliance therewith.
8.
The Disciplinary Hearing Commission will retain jurisdiction of this
matter pursuant to 27 N.C. Admin. Code Chapter 1, Subchapter B, ยง .0114(x) of the
North Carolina State Bar Discipline and Disability Rules throughout the period of any
stayed suspension.
