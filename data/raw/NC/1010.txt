Defendant represented Charlie H. Barney, Jr. ("Barney") in a civil lawsuit against
Michael and Jill Drennen ("the Drennens").
21.
In accordance with a settlement agreement, the Drennens purchased land from
Barney secured by a note and deed of trust executed by the Drennens for the benefit of Barney.

Under the terms of the agreement, the Drennens were to make monthly payments
to Barney.

to Barney.
24.
During the course of this arrangement, with the exception of one payment made
by check, all of the payments the Drennens made to Defendant were cash payments.
25.
The funds paid to Defendant for the benefit of Barney were entrusted funds.
26.

Defendant did not deposit into his trust account the $200.00 cash payment that
Barney picked up from his office.

Consent Order
Page 3 of14

28.
Defendant did not maintain a ledger showing the receipts from the Drennens and
the disbursements to Barney.
29.
In 2013, Barney and the Drennens requested an accounting of funds paid to and
disbursed by Defendant.
30.

Defendant initially refused to provide an accounting of the funds.

31.
Eventually, Defendant provided Barney with a chart showing receipts and
disbursements between January 2007 and Apri12010, but did not provide Barney with a
complete accounting of all funds received by Defendant or all funds disbursed to Barney.
32.
Defendant provided the Drennens with a list of payments he had received from
November 2006 to June 2013 which totaled $13,095.00.
33.
A comparison of Defendant's chart showing payments received from the
Drennens with checks drawn on Parker's trust accounts showing disbursements to Barney, shows
that Defendant deposited into his trust account $1,086.00 more from the Drennens than he
disbursed to Barney.
Administrative Suspension
On August 20,2014, the State Bar issued Notice to Defendant to Show Cause
34.
("Notice") within thirty days of service why his license to practice law should not be suspended
for failure to pay outstanding 2014 membership fees in the amount of $555.00 and failure to
timely certify his IOLTA status for 2014.
35.
The State Bar sent the Notice to Defendant by certified mail at his address of
record with the State Bar's Membership Department.
36.

The Notice was delivered on August 22,2014.

37.

Defendant did not respond to the Notice within thirty days of service.

On or about November 18,2014, the Secretary of the North Carolina State Bar
38.
entered an Order of Administrative Suspension ("Order") suspending Defendant's law license.
39.
The Order provided that Defendant's license would be suspended thirty days after
service ofthe Order. The Order further provided that if Defendant complied with the conditions
of the Order within thirty days after service of the order, his license would not be suspended.
40.
The State Bar sent the Order to Defendant by certified mail at his address of
record with the State Bar's Membership Department.
41.

The Order was delivered on November 20,2014.

Consent Order
Page 4 of14

42.
In a letter dated December 23,2014 and mailed to Defendant at his address of
record with the State Bar's Membership Department, the State Bar notified Defendant that
December 22,2014 was the effective date of the suspension of his law license.
43.
The notification letter also informed Defendant that he had thirty days from the
effective date to wind down existing matters, but that he was prohibited from accepting new
legal fees or engagements as a lawyer.
44.
On Januaty 5, 2015, Jeny Lagle ("Lagle") went to Defendant's office seeking
legal counsel concerning his financial situation.
45.

Specifically, Lagle sought legal counsel about the impending foreclosure on his

home.
47.
On January 5, 2015, Defendant gave Lagle legal advice concerning the
foreclosure. Defendant did not tell Lagle when he spoke with him on January 5, 2015 that his
license was administratively suspended.
48.
Defendant did not tell Lagle when he spoke with him on January 5, 2015 that his
wife, attorney Julie Parker, and not Defendant, would be representing him.
False statement to State Bar
49.
On December 4,2014, Defendant was appointed to represent Leah Chunn
("Chunn") on criminal offenses for which Chunn was arrested on December 3, 2014 for willful
failure to appear, Davie County file nos. 14 CR 51466-51547.
50.
Chunn's parents, (the Clements), paid a professional bail bondsman to bond
Chunn out of jail on the charges referred to in paragraph 49 above and on December 5, 2014
Chunn was released from custody.
51.
Chunn was charged with additional criminal offenses on January 6, 2015, Davie
County file nos. 15 CR 50028, 15 CR 50029, 15 CR 50034, and 15 CR 50035.
52.
On January 7, 2015, the Clements went to Defendant's office to inquire about a
new matter concerning posting a property bond for their daughter, who was in jail.
On January 9, 2015, the Clements went to Defendant's office and Defendant's
53.
paralegal provided them with a deed of trust which stated that it was prepared by Defendant, a
promissory note, and a title opinion which bore Defendant's name but was not signed by him.
54.
The Clements provided the documents to the Davie County Clerk of Court in an
effort to get their daughter out of jail.
55.
Because the deed of trust and title opinion bore Defendant's name, the Clerk, who
was aware that Defendant's law license was suspended, notified the State Bar.

The North Carolina State Bar v. Michael J Parker, 17 DHC 20
Consent Order
Page 5 of14

56.

The State Bar opened grievance file no. 15G0014, and sent Defendant a Letter of

Notice.
57.
In his signed response to the Letter of Notice, Defendant falsely asserted that his
only involvement in the property bond for the Clements was that he had performed a title search
for the Clements on December 10,2014, during his previous representation of Chunn.
58.
Defendant's law license was not in a state of suspension on December 10,2014,
the date on which he claimed to have performed the title search.
59.
There was no need for Defendant to perform a title search for the Clements on
December 10,2014 since Chunn had been released from custody on December 5, 2014 on the
charges on which Defendant represented her.
Based upon the consent of the parties and the foregoing stipulated Findings of Fact, the
Hearing Panel enters the following:
Conclusions of Law

1.
All parties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the Panel has jurisdiction
over Defendant and the subject matter of this proceeding.
2.
Defendant's conduct, as set out in the stipulated Findings of Fact above,
constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(2) as follows:
(a) By failing to truthfully account for and timely remit to the IRS the employment taxes
owed to the IRS, Defendant engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or
misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c);
(b) By failing to maintain a ledger containing a record of receipts and disbursements and
showing the current balance of funds held in the trust account for Barney, Defendant
violated Rule 1.15-3(b)(5) and failed to act with reasonable diligence in representing
a client in violation of Rule 1.3;
(c) By failing to disburse to Barney funds to which he was entitled, Defendant failed to
promptly payor deliver to the client entrusted property belonging to the client and to
which the client was currently entitled in violation of Rule 1.15-2(n) 1;
(d) By failing to deposit cash received from the Drennens for the benefit of Barney into
his trust account, Defendant failed to properly maintain entrusted funds in violation of
Rule 1.15-2(a) and failed to deposit trust funds into his trust account in violation of
Rule 1.15-2(b);
(e) By giving Lagle legal advice at a time when his law license was administratively
suspended, Defendant engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in violation of
1 Previously codified as Rule 1.15-2(m)

The North Carolina State Bar v. Michael J Parker, 17 DHC 20
Consent Order
Page 6 of14

Rule 5.5(a) and accepted representation when the representation would result in a
violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct in violation of Rule 1.16(a);
(f) By failing to inform Lagle that his law license was suspended and that he could not
represent him, Defendant made a false or misleading communication about his
services in violation of Rule 7.1(a)(1) and engaged in conduct involving dishonesty,
deceit, or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c); and
(g) By falsely informing the State Bar that he had performed the title search in December
2014, Defendant knowingly made a false statement of material fact in connection
with a disciplinary matter in violation of Rule 8.I(a).

Upon the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel also finds by clear, cogent, and convincing
evidence the following;

Additional Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline
1.

The findings of fact in paragraphs 1 - 59 above are reincorporated as if set forth

herein.
2.
On or about October 16, 2011, the partnership remitted to the IRS $3,031.08 for
the 1st quarter of2011, $2,120.24 for the 2nd quarter of2011, and $2,612.33 for the 3rd quarter of
2011.
3.
On November 7, 2012, the partnership remitted to the IRS $3,495 for the 2nd and
3 quarters of2012.
rd

4.
In the ensuing years, through the efforts of the partnership and the IRS, the
pminership's employment tax obligations to the IRS were satisfied, and at present, the
partnership has no indebtedness to the IRS for employment taxes.
5.
Defendant and Julie Parker still have a significant indebtedness to the IRS for
personal income tax.
6.
Defendant's failure to truthfully account for and timely remit employment taxes
to the IRS created the foreseeable potential harm of misleading the Department of the Treasury
in its administration of the Internal Revenue Code regarding the partnership's compliance with
the law.
7.
Defendant's failure to timely remit employment taxes withheld from employees
of the partnership demonstrates a disregard for the laws of this state and country and for civic
duty, brings the legal profession into disrepute, and undelmines public confidence in lawyers.
8.
Keeping accurate client ledgers and following sound accounting practices are vital
to ensure proper trust account maintenance and protection of entrusted funds. Defendant's failure

The North Carolina State Bar v. Michael 1. Parker, 17 DHC 20
Consent Order
Page 7 of14

to properly account for entrusted funds for an extended period of time demonstrates Defendant's
intent to commit acts in which the potential harm is foreseeable.
9.
Defendant's conduct placed entrusted funds at risk and had the potential to cause
significant harm to the standing of the profession in the eyes of the public because it shows his
disregard for his duties as an attorney.
10.
Defendant's inattention to the Barney-Drennen matter resulted in the failure to
provide Barney all funds maintained in the trust account for Barney.
11.
Defendant elevated his interest over his clients' interests by failing to properly
account for the funds he was receiving for Barney and by providing legal advice while his
license was administratively suspended.
12.
Defendant impaired Barney's ability to achieve the goal of the representation by
failing to properly account for and disburse the funds he received on Barney's behalf.
13.
Defendant impaired his clients' ability to achieve the goals of the representation
by failing to inform them that he was administratively suspended from the practice of law and
thus unable to provide legal representation.
14.
Although Defendant was not entirely cooperative during the grievance process, he
did cooperate with the State Bar throughout the DHC disciplinary process.
15.
since 1987.

Defendant has substantial experience in the practice of law, having been licensed

16.
The legal profession is entrusted with the privilege of self-regulation. The Bar's
system of self-regulation relies upon attorneys providing full and fair disclosures of the pertinent
facts.
17.
By falsely informing the State Bar that he had performed the title search in
December 2014, Defendant created the risk that the State Bar would be misled which posed
potential harm to the State Bar's system of self-regulation, the profession, and the administration
of justice.
18.
The privilege oflicensure to practice law is accompanied by the fundamental
requirement that an attorney practice law solely within the bounds of licensure. By giving Lagle
legal advice at a time when he was administratively suspended, Defendant caused significant
potential harm to his client and to the standing of the profession in the eyes of the pUblic. Such
erosion of public confidence in attorneys tends to sully the reputation of, and fosters disrespect
for, the profession as a whole. Confidence in the legal profession is a building block for public
trust in the entire legal system.
19.
Defendant has prior professional discipline. In 2009, Defendant was censured in
grievance file 0800186 for violating Rule 8A( c) by making misrepresentations in a loan closing;
Rule l.15-2U) for improperly distributing closing funds; and Rule 8A(a) for his actions in
preparing closing documents and advising the closing agent.

The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fonns of discipline
available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and disbarment, in
considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
Based on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the additional Findings
of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel makes the following:
Conclusions With Respect To Discipline

1.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fonns of discipline
available to it. In doing so, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C. Admin. Code 1B .0116(t)(1) and concludes that the following factors are present:

The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.
Admin. Code 1B .0116(t)(2) and concludes that although Defendant engaged in acts of
misrepresentation and failure to truthfully account for and timely pay over employment taxes,
suspension is warranted, but disbannent is not necessary to protect the public.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.
Admin. Code. 1B .0116(t)(3) and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a)
