CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

I.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง .OI14(w)(1) of the Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and concludes the following factors warrant suspension of
Defendant's license:
(a)

Intent of Defendant to commit acts where harm
foreseeable;

(b)

Elevation of Defendant's own interest above that of his clients;

(c)

Negative impact of Defendant's actions on client's or public's perception
of the profession;

(c)

- 10-

Bar and concludes that none of the factors mandating that disbarment should be
considered is present.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27N.C.A.C. lB ยง .0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the NOIth Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a)

Prior disciplinary offenses;

(b)

A pattern of misconduct;

(c)

Multiple offenses;

(d)

Effect of any personal or emotional problems on the conduct in question During the first half of 20 II, Defendant was under tremendous personal
and emotional stress;

(e)

Effect of any physical or mental disability onthe conduct in questionDefendant has recently been diagnosed with major depressive disordersevere with anxious distress and other health problems;

(f)

Substantial experience in the practice of law; and

(g)

No letter of warning issued to Defendant within the three years
immediately preceding the filing of this complaint.

4.
The Hearing Panel has considered issuing an admonition, reprimand or
censure but concludes that such discipline would not be sufficient discipline because of
the gravity of the harm and potential harm to the clients. The Panel fUlther concludes
that such discipline would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses committed
by Defendant and send the wrong message to attorneys regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar in this State.
5.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser altematives and concludes that
suspension is necessary to ensure Defendant complies with necessary conditions to avoid
significant harm or the potential for significant harm to clients.
6.
For these reasons, the Hearing Panel finds that an order imposing
discipline short ofa suspension of Defendant's law license would not be appropriate.
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law and the findings
of fact and conclusion regarding discipline, and based upon the consent of the parties, the
Hearing Panel enters the following:
