Howle was not successful in receiving reimbursement from the finn for his February 14,2007
reimbursement request.

State Bar intended to be considered by the State Bar in a disciplinary investigation into his
conduct relating to his submission of multiple false expense reimbursement requests submitted to
the firm. In part, Howle represented to the North Carolina State Bar:
In 2004,2005, and 2006, I submitted expense reports and received
payment for CLE trips I planned on taking, but did not take. I did not
refund the advance payments, although I did apply the funds to other
CLE courses and trips taken in those years. [Bold print added.]

31. Howle's April 18,2007 representation to the State Bar was false in that Howle
applied no more than $400 on CLE trips in any of the years that he submitted false CLE
reimbursement forms.
BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact, the hearing committee makes the
following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. All parties are properly before the hearing committee of the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission and the hearing committee has jurisdiction over Howle and the subject matter.
2. Howle's conduct, as set out above, constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C.
Gen. Stat. Â§ 84-28(a) & (b)(2) in that Howle violated the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct
as follows:
(a)

By obtaining funds belonging to the firm, to which he was not entitled,
through the submission of false CLE reimbursement request forms on
January 6,2004, January 18, 2005 and January 17, 2006, Howle
committed criminal acts that reflect adversely on his honesty,
trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in violation of Rule 8.4(b) and
engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or
misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c);

(b)

By attempting to obtain funds belonging to the firm, to which he was not

violation of Rules 8.4(a) and 8.4(b), and engaged in conduct involving

and

5

(c)

By making false representatlons in hls April 18, 2007 letter to the North
CaroEna State Bar relating to his having applied the CLE funds he had
received from the firm to other CLE's in the relevant years when he had
applied no more than $400 on CLE in any of the relevant years, Howle
made false statements of material fact to a tribunal in violation of Rule
3.3(a)(1); and knowingly made a false statement of material fact in a
disciplinary matter in violation of Rule 8.1(a).

BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the evidence
presented at the hearing and the arguments of counsel, the hearing committee hereby makes the
following:
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. Howle's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:

(a)

A dishonest or selfish motive;

(b)

A pattern of misconduct;

(c)

Multiple offenses;

(d)

Submission of false statements during the disciplinary process; and

2. Howle's misconduct is mitigated by the following factors:
(a)

Absence of a prior disciplinary record; and

(b)

Otherwise good character and reputation; and

(c)

Personal or emotional problems.

3. The aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
Disbarment is the only sanction that can adequately protect the public for the
following reasons:
(a). Theft is one of the most serious offenses that anattomey can commit,
whether the theft is from a client or from a law firm. Such an offense demonstrates that
the offending attorney is not trustworthy. Clients are entitled to have trustworthy
attorneys. When an attorney violates that trust, it hanns the public. No discipline short of
disbarment can protect the public from an untrustworthy member of the legal profession.

6

(b)
In addition to the public harm, an untrustworthy attorney harms the legal
profession and the administration of justice. No discipline short of disbarment can
maintain the reputation of the legal profession and instill the public's trust in the
administration of justice.
(c)
Entry of an order imposing discipline short of disbarment would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses that Howle committed and would send the
wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct expected of members of
the Bar in this State.
(d)
The protection of the public, the legal profession and the administration of
justice requires that Howle not be permitted to resume the practice of law until he
demonstrates that he has reformed, and that permitting him to practice law will not be
detrimental to the public or the integrity and standing of the legal profession or the
administration ofjustice. Disbarred attorneys must show reformation, among other
things, before they resume the practice oflaw, whereas no such showing of reformation is
required of an attorney whose license is merely suspended for a term certain.
BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline and the arguments of
counsel, the hearing committee hereby enters the following:
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1. The Defendant, Jeffrey A. Howle, is hereby disbarred.
2. Howle shall surrender his license and membership card to the Secretary within 30 days
ofthe effective date ofthis order.
3. The costs of this proceeding are taxed to Howle and shall be paid as assessed by the
Secretary within 90 days of the entry date of this order.
Signed by the Chair with the consent of the other members of the hearing committee this

~

the ~ day of March 2008.
