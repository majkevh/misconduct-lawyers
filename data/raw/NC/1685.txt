On July 16, 1992, the Grievance Cormnittee of the North carolina state Bar
met and considered the grievance filed against you by the North carolina state
Bar and Fred Tirmns.'
.

. Pursuant to section 13 (A) of article IX of the Rules 'and Regulations of
the North carolina state Bar, the Grievance Committee corrlucted a preliminary
hearing. After considering the infonnation available to it, including your
response to the letter ofn<;>tice, the Grievance Committee found probable
cause. Probable cause is defined in the rules as llreasonable cause to believe
that a member of the North carolina state Bar is gUilty of miscorrluct
justifying disciplinary action."
'!he rules provide that after a firrling of probable cause, the Grievance
Conirnittee may detennine that the fili,n; of a complaint and a hearing before
the Disciplinary Hearing Connnission are not required and the Grievance
Corrnnittee may issue various levels of discipline deperx:ling upon the
misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any aggravating or
mitigating factors. '!he Grievance Committee may issue an adironition,
reprimand, or censure to the resporrlent attorney.
A reprimand is a written fonn of discipline more serious than an
admonition issued in cases in which an attorney has violated one or more
provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct and has caused hann or
potential ham to a client, the administration of justice, the profession, or
a member of the public, bUt the miscorrluct does not require a ,~.
,
'!he Grievance Committee was of the opinion that a censure is not required
in this case and issues this reprimand to you. As chainnan of the Grievance
Corrnnittee of the North cat:olina state Bar, it is roN my duty, to issue this
repd.rllaro and I am certain that you will urrlerstan:i fully the, spirit in which
this duty is performed.
You represented I.arrY Wayne Klein in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding.
You were ordered by the bankruptcy court to file an application for allowance
~tionand

of

reimbursement of expenses in connection with the Klein

case.

You failed to comply with the court's order. By order dated Janum:y
22, 1990, you were required to file an application for fees in the Klein case.
You failed to comply with that order and the bankruptcy court required you to
return all compensation paid' to you which was not app~ed by the court.
Again, you failed to' obey the bankruptcy court's order that you pay your
~ttorneys 1:ee to the' bankruptcy clerk •

ifue court ordered in' a June 21, 1990 ord~ tkt you be heU<;iin civi1l.
contempt for your noncompliance of previous'~ orders. As' a sanct.i,on, you
w~ required to pay interest at the per anrn.nn rate established by fedaral· :li;lW
on $3,025.50 (the fee paid to you) .fram March 19, ,1990 until paid. You were
all?O prohibited from practicing law 'in the bankruptcy cotUt for the~tern
Oistrict of N()rth carolina until the fee had been paid in to ·th~~. '!be
court :furtl)er pointed out th.at you failed to atten:i the' JUrie 20, 1990 h~ing
which resulted in the June 21, 1990 order.
"
.'

I

Even after the ,aforem:mtioned orders fram the bankruptcy court,' you
continued to disregard the .sanctions inp:>sed by t.,he court. ConseqUently, a
hearing was scheduled for September 19, 1990 'to determine what' furtl1er civil
contempt sanctions should be inp:>sed against you. 'Ih~ court was also 1:9
consider whether to refer the matter to the U. s. District Court for
consideration of whether your failure to canply with the court's' ord~
constituted criminal contempt.
'.

.

.

. Your corrluct with respect to noncompliaI1.G6 of Court orders violates
Rqle .1.2 (D) of the Rules of Professional Corxiuct. ~ an officer of the court,
you have an obligation to adhere to the court'$ orders. You hqv~ indicated '
that· you were ill and cou).d not "competently reac;:t" to the si~tion regarding
the bai1kruptcy court's orders. It does not appear that you aQvisea. th~' court
, ot your illness and inability to comply with the qaurt"$ orders until I after ,
several orders. had been entered.'
-.
,
. You are reminded that as an officer of .thecoUr1;:., 'it is ~tiYe t:nat
th~ court's work can pi:'oce$:l 'in q.n ,
orderly fashion.
.

yoil follCM the court's orders so that

In February or March of 1991, you consulted with Fred and Paul.ine 'rimrns '
regarding their filing for bankruptcy. You claim that you advised Mr. and
MrS. Tinims that you charged a non-refun::1able $120.00 for the bankruptcy
consultation. Mr. and Mrs. Tinnns claim that you did noi: ;i.hfonn tpem that the
$120.00 fee was not refurxlable.
.'
'

Your consultation with Mr. and Mrs. Tilnrns OQC:urreqaiter tl)e bankrliptcy
ordered you to cease 'practicing bankruptcy law. In fact, the banJO:uptcy
cOurt scheduled a hearing to detennine whether additional sanctions' should be
imposed for your failure to cOmply wfth the court's orders p:tahibiting you
'from practicil:lg bankruptcy law as a result of your bankruptcy co~tations.
Your consultations constituted the practice of bankruptcy law. , ,OI.lr North
. carolina General statutes (Section 84-2.1) provide that the giving ofaQvice
or opinions upon the legal rights of a perSon is the prg,ctice ,of U"lW. 'Ih~
your bankruptcy consultations to the Timms and others' violateq 'the ,bankruptcy
coUrt's o1;:'der.
.
~

Your corrluct with respect to noncompliance with thecOurt's'order
violated Rule 1. 2 (D) ot the Rules of Professional Con:1uct.- Again; as, an
officer of the court you must be ever ,mirxiful of your Obligation to c;:on1ply
with the court's orders.
