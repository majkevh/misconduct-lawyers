A reprimand is a written form of discipline more serious than an admonition issued in
cases in which an attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional
Conduct and ihas caused harm or potential harm to a client, the administration of justice, the
profession, or a member of the public, but the misconduct does not require a censure.

and issues this reprimand to you. As chairman bfthe Grievance Committee of the North
Carolina StatÂ¢ Bar, it is how my duty to issue this reprimand, and I am certain that you will
understand wIly the spirit in which this duty is performed.

April 22, 2004 regarding your advertisement in the teleph()ne book's yellow pages. This

the Revise4 Rules of Professional Conduct. You received a letter of warning relative to your
violation of Rule 7.l(a)(1) by certified mail on May 17,2004.
As of September 29,2004, you had neither removed the advertisement from the yellow

to discontinue the advertisement. in the yellow pages, but the ad could not be removed until the .
new telephone books were published for 2005.
