On July·19, 2000,·the Griev~nce·Committee of the North Carolina State Bar met and considered
the grievance filed against you hy \The North Carolina State Bar.
.,

,

Pursuant to section .0113(a)ofthe Discipline and Disability Rules of the North Car6lmaState
Bar, the Grievance Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considerhtg the informa~o!1 .
available to it, including your respqnse to the letter ofnotice, the Grievance Committee found probable
cause. Probable cause is defined in· i4e ~es as "reasonable cause to believe that a member of tlle North·
Carolina Sta,te Bar is gtlilty of misconduct justifying disciplinary action."
The rules provide that after.a.:tindingofprobable cause, the Grievance Committee m~ydet¢rmine
that the filing ofa complaint and ~ hearing before the DisciplilJ,ary Hearing Commission are not
required, and the Grievance CoInIItittee may issue various levels of discipline depending upon t1!le .

Grievance Committee may i~sue an 'ad.m,onition, a reprimand, or a censure to the respondent attorney•.

A reprimand is a written fotID 'of discipline more serious than an .admonition issued in c8is.eshl'
which an attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct andlhas .'
caused harm or potential harm to a client, the administration of justice,. the profession,or a member of
the pUblic, but the misconduct doe.s. not require a censure.
The Grievance Committee:was of the opinion that a censure is not required in this casel ;:md
issues this reprimand to you. As cb,aiiman of the Grievance Committee of the North CarqlinaS1(ate Bar,
it is now my duty to issue.this reprimand, and I am certain that'you will understand fully the.spitiit in
which this duty is performed.
.
In 1999, you were charged with six counts of obtaining property by false pretel1se,and O.n.e count
of attemptipg to obt~n property by false pretenses. These charges arose 01,lt of your cond1,lct ill :fPrging
prescriptions to obtain medications, to which you had becomeadqicted.
.

.

In January 2000, the criminal charges against you were dismissed, after you succ.essfully:
completed a deferred prosecution program in Cumberland CQunty.

Although you were not cqmj,cted criminally, thery is considerable evidence that you were in fact
guilty of the underlying offem,es.:, ,~n fact, you confessed your guilt to one of the investigating officers.
In mitigation, the GrievaIl~e Committee noted that you volUiltarily ceased practicing law about
the time of your arrest, that you h~ve made attempts to recover from your addiction and that the
addiction which caused yoUr mis90nduct occurred from prescription medication and not illegal
experimentation with drugs. "
Because of the strong nrltig~ting factors in your case, the Grievance Committee elected to
impose discipline, rather than sending tJ1.e matter for trial before the Disciplinary Hearing Commission.

depart from adherence to the high ethjcal,standard~ of the legal profession.
