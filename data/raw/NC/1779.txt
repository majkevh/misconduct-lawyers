, On April l4, 1994, the Grievance Committee of the North
Carolina State Bar metanc;i considered the grievance f;Lled ~gains't
you by the State Bar.
Pursuant to Section 13 (A) of Article IX of the Rules ana
Regulations of the North,Caroliria St~te Bar, the Grievance
Committee conducted a p~eliminary hearing. Afterconsiqering the
information available to'it, including your response to the ,
letter of notice, the Grievance Committee found probab1e cause.
J?robable cause is defined in the rules as II reasonable, cause to
believe that a member o'f the North Carolina State Bar is. g'\J.il ty
of misconduct justifying ,disciplinary action. I I
The rules provide that after a finding of probable cause,
the Grievance Committee may determine that the filing of a
complaint and a' hearing' 'pefore the Disciplinary Hearing
Commiss,ion are not required and the Grievance Committee may, is,sue,
various levels of discipline depending upon the misconduct, the
actual or potentia],. inj,ury. caused,and any aggravating, or
mitiga~ing factors.
The GrievanGe Committee may iss~e ,an
admonition, reprimand, or censure to the respondent ,a.ttorney.

Araprimand is a wiitten form of discipline more serioU~
than an admonition issue'd in cases in which p'n attorney has
violated ont? or more provisions of the Rules of Professional
Conduct and has caused harm or potential ha:l:"m to a c;::lient, the
administration of ju,sticel, the profession, or a member of the
public, but themiscondu~t does not require a censu,re.
Th.e Grievance Committ'ee was of the opinion that a censure is
not required in this ca,se and issues this reprimand to you.
As
cha'lrman of the' Grievance Committee of, the North Carolina stq.te
Bar, it is nqw my duty to issue this reprimand and I am cert~in
that you will understand fully the spirit in which this duty is
perfoJ:"med.

I

I

On Februa~y 10, 1993, UNC Hospital sent a certified copy of
Robert Sides'medical records by certified mail to the Clerk of
Superior Court: in Durham County. The records were under seal and
marked to be open by the presiding judge.
In additi9n, on February 5,1993 you had a subpoena duces
tecum issued to Duke University Medical Center and requested that
the hospital produce Robert Sides i medical records.' There was no
specific date to produce indicated on that subpoena 'and delivery
of the records was required 'iby February 1993". On ,February 16,
1993, the medical 'records custodian from Duke University Medical
Center certified that Mr. Sides' medical records w~re provided to
the court.
Attorney Fred T. Moutos and Catherine Constantinou, both
employees of Y9ur law firm, removed the medical records provided
by UNC Hospital and Duke University Medical Center from the
clerk's office and tOQk them to your office. Mr. Moutos and Ms.
Constantinou d~d not nave'authorization from the courts to remove
the medical re86rds from the clerk's office.
Mr. Sides' medical records were shown to your clients.
Also, a newspaper reporter from the Durham Herald Sun newspaper
visited your office arid discussed yo~r clients; cases against Ms.
Sides. A portion of Ms. Sides' medical records were given to the
newspaper reporter, although it is unclear who disclosed these
'confidential records to the reporter.

original records to the court, but you did not return th~ copies
that you made 0f the medical records until November 22,. 1993

sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 of the North Carolina.RUles of
Civil Procedure and a motion to quash subpoena. The motion for
sanctions was heard by Judge Brannon on November 22 and November
23, 1993.

subpoena duces tecum to TINC Hospital to obtain the confi4ential,
privileged, personal hospital records of Robert Sides, a
non-party to the action, was done for an improper purpose and
violated Rule 11 and ,Rule 45 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil
Procedure.

I

The Grievance Committee finds. that your conduct with resp~ct
to subpoehaing the med~c~l records of Robert Sides and the diS.closure of his medic~l r~cords to th~ press violates R-ule 1.i(D)
of the Rules of P:(ofeSsional Conduct. That rule provides that an

administration of justice. The Grievance Committee also found
that your removal, opening, and copying of the sealed medical
recor,ds without notice to Ms. ,Sides and without obtaining the
court's,p$rmission were improper and in violation of Rl;lle 1.2(D).
You disclosed ~onfidehtial medical records of a non~party,
with a newspaper reporter; The newspaper reporter then wrote'
apout this information in his article. Your conduct in this
matter was improper and infringed upon the physician-patient;.
privilege which was not waived by Mr. Sides.
The Grievance Committ$e took into consideration that you ,
were sanctioned py the cQurt. The Grievance Committee consi¢l,ered
your statement that you were unclear about Rule 45 and its
application.
You are advised to seek the advice of other lawyers
when you have some question in this area.

the high ethical standarqs of the legal profession.

I
