North Carolina State Bar by 27 N.C. Admin. Code Chapter I, Subchapter B, Rules .01 05(a)( 12)
and .01 16(b)(4) of the NOlih Carolina State Bar Discipline & Disability Rules. and based upon
the record in this matter, the undersigned finds as follows:
I.
On September 28,20 II, Russell Flint Crump (hereinafler "Crump") tendered a plea
of nolo contendere in the Circuit Court of the Eighth Judicial Circuit of Florida to onc count of child
abuse, a 3" degree felony. Defendant's plea was accepted by the court and Crump was sentenced to
community control for 90 days followed by 364 days in the Alachua County Jail, to bc followed by
~ g rnonths probatiun.
2.
As a result or Crump's felony conviction for child abuse, on November 28, 201 I,
the Disciplinary Hearing Commission of the North Carolina Stale Bar entered a consent order
suspending Crump !i'om the practice of law in North Carolina pending disciplinary proceedings
before the North Carolina State Bar.
3.
As a result of Crump's lelony conviction for child abuse, the Florida State Bar
initiated disciplinary proceedings against Crump and Crump was tried before a Referee.
4.
On 23 January 2012, the Referee issued a report concluding that Crump violated
Rule 4-8.4(b) of the Rules Regulating The Florida Bar by committing a criminal act that reflects
adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects, and
recommending that Crump be disbatTed.
5.
By order dated April 19. 2012 the Supreme Court of Florida entered an oreler
approving the report of the Referee and disbarring Crump. A celiified copy of the disbarment
order is attached hereto and incorporated by reference.
G.
On May 21, 2012, Crump was served by certified mail with the North Carolina
State Bar's Notice of Reciprocal Discipline Proceeding.

7.
More than 30 days have elapsed since Crump was served with the Notice of
Reciprocal Discipline Proceeding and Crump has failed to show cause that imposition of the
identical discipline would be unwarranted.
BASED UPON THE FOREGOING FINDINGS, the Chairperson of the Grievance
Committee makes the following CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:
I.
The North Carolina State Bar has jurisdiction over the subject maller of this
proceeding and over the person of Russell F. Crump.
?
The procedure for imposition of reciprocal discipline pursuant to n N.C. Admin.
Code Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Rule .0116 of the North Carolina. State Bar Discipline &
Disability Rules has been complied with.

3.
Crump's misconduct as found by the Supreme Court of Florida constitutes
conduct in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. 84-24(b)(I) and Rule 8.4(b) of the North Carolina State
Bar Rules of Professional Conduct and justifies the imposition of reciprocal discipline in this
state.
4.
The equivalent discipline imposed by the Supreme Court of Florida should be
imposed on Crump's right to practice law in the Stale of North Carolina. The equivalent
discipline in North Carolina to that imposed by the Supreme Court of Florida is disbarment.
