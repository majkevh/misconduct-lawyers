public censure is not the ,JOC)st serious discipline that: may be,' iniposec:1', by 'the'
North Carolina State Bar should not be taken ,by you to indicate that ~ny
member of the Corrini ttee feels that yOt.I,r conduct was exc1;lsap;leor 1e$S thqI) a

These were executed by Sherrie Hughey on March 23, 1983 and you filed them
when you filed the divorce action on March 25, 1984 in Buncombe County, file
number 83 CvB 0909.

I"

The Madison County Child
Support Enforcement Agency filed a motion to
I
intervene in the divorce action in Buncombe County on April 22, 1983.
On April 28, 1983, yqu prepared a Notice of Dismissal in the divorce
case, file number 83 CvD Q909. You also prepared a second Complaint for
divorce on Michael Hughey';s behalf,
,
On May 17, 1983, the tMadison County Child Support Enforcement Agency
filed a Complaint against ,Michael Hughey for back support paid to Sherrie
Hughey in Madison County, I'file number 83 CvD 63.

-

May 24,1983, you ,filed the second Canplaint for divorce in Buncombe
County, file number 83 CvP 1493. This Complaint also sought to have the
terms of the separation. agreement incorporated into any judgment. You filed
the second Compl~int know:i;ng that Madison County Child Support Enforcement had
a claim against Michael H~ghey.
On

On May 25, 1,983 an Entry of Appearance and an Answer was prepared under
your direction for execution by the opposing party; Sherrie Hughey. You filed
these doct.lI'Cents on May 27, 1983. You obtained a Judgment dissolving the
marriage between the Hugh~ys on May 27, 1983 before Madison County Child
Support Enforcement had an opportunity to intervene.

en June 1,1983, youifiled an Answer in the Madison County action on
Michael Hughey's behalf c~aiming that the Buncombe County Judgment rendered
the issue of Michael Hugh1y's support obligation res judicata.

I

By preparing an EntrY of Appearance and an Answer for Sherrie Hughey in
the lawsuit brought against her by your client, Michael Hughey, you violated
DR5-l05(A). Your preparation of documents for both sides of the lawsuit
constituted a conflict of I interest. Your filing the Entry of Appearance and
Answer of Sherrie Hughey ~n file nmtiber 83 CvD 1493 allowed you to get a
Judgment on Michael Hughey's behalf before Madison County Child Support
Enforcement could intervene with their claim against Micheal Hughey. You
filed these documents kno~ihg of Madison County Child Support Enforcement's,
claim against Miohael Hugq.ey~ Your attempt to cut off Madison County Child
Support Enforcement's claim by this method was prejUdicial to the
administration of justice in violatioh of DR 1-102(AH5).
I

YoU claimed to have been acting in your client's best interest, relying
on his statement that })e owed n6 back support. However, the question of back
suppbrt was for the Court to decide. Your filing of the Entry of Appearance
and Answer for Sherrie Hughey was an attempt to prevent the Court from
reaching the back support:issue by having it precluded through incorporation
of the terms o~ the separation agreement in the Judgment.
Your conduct was unprofessional. It violated not only the letter of the
Code of Professional RespOnsibility but also its spirit. Your conduct was not
the conduct expected of a member of the legal profession and an officer of the
court. It brought discredit upon you, the professioh, and the courts. It
