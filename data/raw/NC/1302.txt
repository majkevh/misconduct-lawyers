Mr. Smith oral~y presented his views to the Committee
ahd answered numerous questions directed to him.
,
TheConunittee has considered itself to be acting under
Rule IX, Secti.on 2S (A) (4) of. the Rules and Regulations of the
State Bar .for the purpos~ of making such inquiry into this matter
as the Council deems nec¢ssary.
Conditions applying to Mr. Smith
are contained in Rule IX!, Section 24 (A) (1.), which states that no
member of the State Bar suspended may resume practice until reinstated by the order of the Council, and Rule IX,. Section 24, which
in part requires a suspe~ded att9rney to give notice of his suspens'ion to 'his clients and, certain other persons.•
As a result of the hearing on ~une 24, 1977, the Commission made findings fq.'Vorahle to Mr. Snii th in 77 DHC 8 but found
against him in 77 DRC 4 ~nd imposed discipline. The terIns of the
discipline were to sus:pe'~d Mr. Arnold from the practice of law for
the period of one year, l;>egiI'ming on August 1, 1977, and to tax him
with the costs in 77 DHCI4. It was ordered that Mr. Smith might
apply for reinstatement six months after the date of the suspension
of his license. Mr. Coley, counsel for the State Bar, advises that
Mr. Arnold has paid the costs in question, and it is clear the period of the suspension. of,his law ,license has expired.
Mr. Smith toid:the Committee that he has fulfilled all
of the requirements set forth in Rule IX, Section 24; that, although
he has a histoU of alC9holi$~, he ha,s 'not indulged in alcohol since
Jun~ 13, 1976; t~at ~oth~ng has occurred since August 1, 1977 which
re·flects adversely oh his eharacter or his ability to practice law;
and that there are no co~plaints against him now pending with the
S·ta te Bar.
f

Prior to the m~eting, Mr. Coley confirmed there were no
complaints pending against Mr •.Smith, and advised that the State Bar
has no evidence of developments since August 1, 1977 which reflect
adver'sely ort Mr. Snii th 's character or his ability to practice law.
The file prepared by the ,State Bar contains Mr. Smith's Affidavit
dated August 10, 1977, th,at he has complied with Rule 24.
history:

There .are several negative factors appearing. in Mr. Smith's
the matter of his alcohoiism, now apparently under control;
