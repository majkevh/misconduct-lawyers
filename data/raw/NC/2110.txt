3. During the times "relevant to this complaint, Godwin actively engaged in
the practice of law in the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office in
the city of Wilmington, New. Hanover County, North Carolina ..

4. Since at least November 1994 and at all times relevant to this
complaint, Godwin has maintained a trust account at First Citizens Bank and
Trust Company (formerly Peoples Federal Savings Bank, hereinaft~r collectively
referred to as "First Citizens), account number 112304, in which all client or
fiduciary funds handled by Godwin were supposed to beheld in trust (hereinafter
"trust account").
5. At all times relevant to this complaint, Godwin also maintained the
following two accounts from which Godwin generally met his law finn's operating
or business expenses: (1) account number 112312 at First Citizens, out of
which general business expenses, other than payroll, generally were paid
(hereinafter "operating accoune); and (2) account number 142251 at First
Citizens, out of which payroll expenses for Godwin's employees generally were
paid (hereinafter "payroll account").

I

Trust Account Violations

6. Beginning on April 30, 1995, Godwin had insufficient funds in his trust
account to cover all the money he was supposed to be holding in trust for all his
clients.
"
7. From April 30, 1995 until April 30, 1997, when the State Bar enjoined
him from handling client funds (hereinafter "defalcation period"), Godwin never
had sufficient funds in his trust account to cover all the money he was supposed
to be holding in trust for all his clients.
, .
8. During this entire two year defalcation period, Godwin never reconciled
his trust account balances of funds belonging to all clients.
9. On at least six different occasions during the defalcation period,
checks made payable to Godwin were issued out of Godwin's trust account and
deposited into either Godwin's operating or payroll account.

I

10. Specifically, the following checks were drawn from Godwin's trust
account and made payable to Godwin in the following amounts:

(1) On December 11,1995, check number 2278 for $1,000;
(2) On December 21, 1995, check number 2283 for $170;
(3) On February 1, 1996, check number 2287 for $500;
(4) On February 8: 1996, check number 2288 for $400;
(5) On July 3, 1996, check number 2303 for $200; and
2

I
'..

.~.I'

906

(6) On November 1, 1996, check number 2205 for $300.
11. These six checks did not represent fe~s to which Godwin was
entitled. Moreover, Godwin did not have permission to use any part of the funds
held in trust for the benefit of himself or any third partY: other than his clients. .

12. In all six instances, the funds from Godwin's trust account were used
to pay Godwin's law firm operating and busQness expenses, including Godwin's
payroll.

I

13. At the time these six checks were withdrawn fro in Godwin~s. trust
account and deposited into his operating or payroll account, Godwin had
insufficient funds in the respective operating or payroll account to pay his or his
law firm's bills or obligations out of the funds in those accounts.

14. AdditionaJiy, on April 19, 1996, check number 2295 was issued from
the trust account made payable to Ryan Broussard in the amount of $1 ,323.49.
15. At the time check number 2295 was issued, the balance in the trust
account was $75.80. First Citizens honored the check but issued a NSF notice
to Godwin's office and included a NSF charge ori Godwin's next bank statement
for his trust account.
16. After check number 2295 was issued to Broussard and the NSF
charge "Yas made, the balance of Godwin's trust account was -$1,269.69.
17. On April 24, 1996, a check was issued from Godwin's operating
account and deposited into his trust account in the amount of $1 ,27.0. The check
from Godwin's operating account was issued after the Broussard check to
reimburse the trust account and to return the ac;count to a positive balance.

1

18. On April 25, 1996, First Citizens dishonored the $1,270 check from
Godwin's operating account.

19. On April 30, 1996, the $1,270 check from Godwin's operating account
was resubmitted to First Citizens for deposit into the trust account and honored.

20. At the time the Broussard check was presented for payment to First
Citizens, Godwin did not have on file with First Citizens a directive requiring First
Citizens to report to the North Carolina State Bar when any check drawn on his
trust account was presented for payment against insufficient funds.
21. All of the above-mentioned checks issued from and deposits into
Godwin's trust, operating or payroll aCCOUGlts were done by Godwin's legal
assistant, (hereafter referred to' as "LA").

22. Godwin employed LA as a legal assistant in his office beginning in
July 1995. LA was employed by Godwin until August 1997.
23. Shortly after he hired her, Godwin authorized LA to issue and sign
checks on and make deposits into his trust, operating and payroll accounts.

24. During the period in which Godwin gave LA authority to issue ~md
sign checks on and make deposits into his trust, operating and payroll accounts,
Godwin failed to make reasonable efforts to ensure that his law firm had in effect
~easures that would provide reasonable assurance that LA's actions were
compatible with his professional respmrlsibilWes and obligations.
Burton

M~}tter

25. Billy E. Burton (hereinafter "Burton") retained Godwin in
approximately December 1995 to represent him on a personal injury matter.
26. On approximately July 11, 1996, Godwin received medical payments
in the amount of $2,613.87 from the opposing parties in Burton's personal injury
claim. These payments were made under a liability insurance contract providing
for the payment of Burton's medic~1 expenses without regard to fault.

27. Godwin took a one-third fee from the medical payments in the amollnt
of $871.29, and disbursed the remainder, $1,742.58, to Burton.

.

,

28. On or about September 26, 1996, Godwin received a check for the
settlement of Burton's personal injury suit in the amount of $9,000. Godwin took
a one-third fee of $3,000, retained $2,577 in his trust account to pay various of
Burton's medical expenses, and disbursed ',.he r~91aining $3,423 to Burton.
29. As of January 21, 1997, almost ::our months after settling Burton's
personal injury case, Godwin had not paid l3urton's medical bills from the funds
he withheld from settlement.
30. Burton and his wife applied for a loan for a new vehicle on
approximately January 21, 1997, and discovered that the medical bills, which
Godwin was supposed to have paid, had not been paid and had been referred
as overdue accounts on the Burtons' credit report.

31. On the same day, Burton and his wife came to Godwin'S office and
were informed by Godwin's employee, Dave Perry, that there were insufficient
funds in the trust account to pay Burtc;m's medical bills.

I

32. Godwin subsequently became involved in the conversation with
the Burtons. After the Burtons told Mr. Godwin that the medi~al bills had
not been paid and that Dave Perry had told them that there were
insufficient funds in the trust account to pay the medical bills, Godwin told
the Burtons that there were sufficient funds in the trust account to cover
Burton's medical expenses. In fact, there were not sufficient funds in the tru~t
account to cover Burton's medical expenses at the time of Godwin's
conversation with the Burtohs.

I

33. As of January 21, 1997, the balElnce in the trust account was
$115.99. Consequently, at the time, Godwin talked to the Burtons, he
r~a~onably should have known that there were not sufficient funds in the trust
account to pay Burton's medical bills.
34. As ,of January 21, 1997, the amount that Godwin shQuld' have been
holding in 'his trust account for all his clients was $4,073.21. Consequently, there
was a defalcation in the trust account in the amount of $3,957.22 on that date.
35 .. The primary reasons that there were insufficient funds in Godwiri'~
trust account to pay Burton's medical bills were: (a) the'issuance of the six
specific checks from his trust account to his operating and payroll accounts ,by ,
his :Iegal assistant LA, set forth in Count I above, and (b) LA's issuance of check
number 2208 from Godwin's trust account to a third party.
36. Specifically, on or about September 25, ,1996, LA issued check
number 2208 on Godwin's trust account in the amount of $2,000 and made
payable to Jay Khajanchi.
37. On September 25,1996, when check number 2208 was drawn on the
trust account, Godwin was not holding any funqs, in his trust account for Jay
Khajanchi. In fact Godwin was not holding any funds in his trust account for Jay
Khajanchi at any time during the two year defalcation period.

I

38. Con~equently, the Jssuance of check number 2208 exacerbated an
already existing defalcation in the trust account.
39. As of September 25, 1996, the amount Godwin should have been
holding in the trust account for existing clients was $10,298.88. After cheek
number 2208 was drawn, the balance of the account was $6,770.66. Thus, the
defalcation in the account after CheCK number 2208 was drawn on the account
on September 25,1996 was -$3,528.22.
40. After Godwin became aware that Burton's medical bills had not
been paid" he paid Burton's medical providers from his own funds.

41. Godwin also, reimbursed or made reasonable attempts to
reimburse all clients whose funds were misappropriated from his trust
account without his knowledge or direction.

Marlowe Closing

42. In 1997, Godwin agreed to conQuct a closing of a refinancing loan for
a client, Ron Marlowe (hereafter i'MarloWe").

43. In connection with that closing, on Qr about March 13, 1997, Godwin
received from the lender, Branch Banking and Trust ("BB&T"), a cashier's check
in the amount of $64,900, repr~senting the proceeds of the loan.,
44. On or about March 26, 1997, Godwin had Marlowe sign and execute
the necessary documents for the loan closing (hereinafter "dry closing").

45. Godwin did not deposit the $64,900 cashier's check from BB&T into
his trust account until April 3, 1997. '
46. As of April 30, 1997" Godwin had failed to disburse the proceeds of
the loan to the appropriate parties.

47. As a result of Godwin's failure to disburse the loan proceeds by April
30,1997, Marlowe's guaranteed loan rate expired and had to be re-negotiated
with BB&T, and a second loan closing had to be conducted by another attorney
on June 9,1997. As a result of the delay, Marlowe incurred additional charges
on the loan in the amount of $1,305.72.

48. Godwin paid $500 of the additional interest charges at the time
of the second closing on June 9, 1997.
49. As early as February 1998, Godwin wa~ aware that Marlowe had
foregone an additional $805.72, tl:Jat he should have reCeived at the original
loan closing, but did not becalise of th£l additional interest charges.

I

50. Godwin did pay the additional $805.72. However, Godwin did not
reimburse Mariowe for these funds, until 2 weeks before the hearing in this
matter, on the advice of his attorney.

Representations to State Bar

51. After the State Bars audit of Godwin'S trust account, Godwin entered
into an agreement with the State Bar on March 21, 1997 ( hereinafter "March 21
Agreement"): Pursuant to the March 21 AgreementjGodwin, among other
'
things, was required to reimburse five clients for funds which he had received
from them in trust. The aggregate amoun~ Godwin was required to disburse to
all these clients was $1,,087.
52. Godwin subsequently issued c~1ecks drawn on his trust account to
these clients. At the time Godwin Issued ~hese five checks out ofthe trust
account, there were still insufficient funds in the trust account to cover the: checks
and Godwin's obligations to his other clients.
53. The State Bar subsequently requested information regarding whether
Godwin had reimbursed these five clients. After receiving information that
Godwin had issued checks to these five clients, the State Bar questioned why
Godwin issued the checks without depositing sufficient fund~ into the trust .
account to cover these checks.
54. In response, Godwin told State Bar Investigator David J. Frederick
that a $641.61 deposit on March 21, 1997, identified on the trust account bank
statement, was a deposit Godwin made of his personal funds to cover a portion
of those ch~cks.

55. In fact, the $641.61 deposit represented funds of another client,

c.A

Joyce.
56. At the time Godwin represented to Investigator Frederick that the
$641.61 was a corrective deposit of his funds to ,cover the above-mentiQned five
checks to clients, Godwin had not made any corrective deposits to the trust
account to cover the five checks he issued.

57 ~At that time, Godwin was the only signatory on all, of his
accounts. If such a corrective- deposit had been made, Godwin woulci have
,, had to issue the check to be deposited into his trust account.
58. Thus, at the time he made the above-mentioned repre$entations
to Investigator Frederick, Godwin knew that the $641.61 depositwas not a
corrective deposit.
'
59. Godwin knowingly and intentionally made a false
misrepresentation of material fact to Investigator Frederick in respon$e tQ
an inquiry in a disciplinary matter.

Conflict in Domestic Matter
60. In approximately July 1995, Godwin began representing Mrs. Sin
domestic matters against her then-husband, Mr. S.
61. On February 14, 1996, Godwin, on behalf of Ms. B, filed a complaint
against Mr. S in New Hanover County District Court. The complaint alleged
claims for relief for divorce from bed and board, equitable distribution and
alimony and sought post-s~paration support.

I

62. In November 1996, Godwin began dating Ms., S.

,

63. In approximately January 1997, Godwin began a sexual relationship
, with his client, Ms. S.
64. As of January 1997, when Godwin began a sexual relationship with
Ms. B, Ms. S's claim for alimony against Mr. B was still outstanding.
65. Godwin continued to represent Ms. B on her outstanding claims for
alimony and unpaid post-separation support after he began a sexual relationship
with her. Godwin filed and responded to various motions in the matter and
appeared in court after he began a sexual relationship with Ms. B.
66. On or about August 5, 1997, Godwin received a letter and proposed
motion to disqualify Godwin as counsel for Ms. B from Mr. B's attorney.
67. The basis for the proposed motion to disqualify Godwin was that
Godwin, was having an ongoing sexual relationShip with Ms. B and that lie would
likely be called as a witness to testify as to that relationship in the alimony trial.
, "
ea. The letter stated that if Godwin did not agree to withdraw as Ms. B's
counsel, the motion would be filed-.

I

69. Mrs. B's claim for alimony was on a trial calendar for the Augus~
4, 1997 session of court.
70~ Godwin signed and returned the letter agreeing to wilhdrawas
Mrs. B'~ attorney and to continue Mrs. B's alimony claim until another
session of court. Godwin had not withdrawn from representing Mrs. B
previously.

71. The alimony trial subsequently was scheduled for October 21, 1997.
Prior to hearing the alimony matter, the court held a hearing on Ms. S's separate
motion to show cause for Mr. S's failure to pay post-separation support.

, witnesses for Mr. B and were compelled to testify about the nature and extent of
their sexual relationship. Another attorney 'represented Ms. B at this hearing.
73. After the hearing on the show cause motioniin which Godwin and
Ms. B were compelled to testify about their sexual rel,ationship, Ms. B dismissed
her alimony claim against Mr.

a.

Post-Separation Support Claim

I

74. On April 19, 1996, following a hearing, the presiding Judge ordered
Mr. B to pay $250 per month in post-separation support to Ms. B.
75. Godwin was responsible for drafting the order for post-separation
support.
76. Godwin 'failed to have a final ~ritten order for post-separation support
entered until June 23, 1997, more than a year after the hearing.
77. Mr. B failed to pay post-separation support to Ms. B as ordered by the
court.
78. Godwin, on b~half of Ms. B, was unsuccessful in enforcing and
collecting the post-separation support payments from Mr. B until months after
Godwin got the final written order for post-separation support entered on June
23,1997.
Equitable Distribution Claim and Tax Proceeds
79. In approximately October 1995, Godwi~ received a check issued
jointly to Mr. and Ms. B in the amount of $734.52 from the North Carolina
Department of Revenue, which check represented a tax refund (hereinafter "tax
refund check").

I

80. Godwin deposited the tax refund check into his trust account.

81. Mr. and Ms. B disputed the ownership of tax refund check proceeds,
and these proceeds became one of the items that the CQurt had to resolve in the
equitable distribution claim~
82. The equitable'distribution claim was heard on October 11, 1996.
83. At the October 11, 1996 hearing on equitable distribution, the court
ordered that the t~x refund check proceeds be divided equally between and
distributed to Mr. and Ms. B.

84. At the end of the hearing, the court directed Godwin to draft the
judgment of equitable distribution. .

85. On several occasions thereafter, ,Mr. B requested Godwin to draft the
equitable distribution judgment and disburse to him his share of the tax refund
check proceeds.

86.. Notwithstanding Mr. B's requests and the October 11, 1996 court
order, GodWin did not file the equitable distribution judgment and did hot release
to Mr. B his half of the tax refund check proceeds. Godwin held Mr. B's one half
of the tax refund check as long as he possibly could.

I

87.. On February 7, 1997, Mr. B filed a pro se motion requesting the court
to order Godwin to file the equit~ble distribution judgment.

88. On February 10, 1997, the court en,tered an order directing Godwin to
prepare and serve Mr. B with a proposed equitable distribution judgment not later
than February 14, 1997.

89. Godwin failed to comply with the court's order to prepare and serve
the equitable distribution judgment by February 14, 1997.
90. On February 28, 1997, Mr. B filed another pro se motion to compel
Godwin to file the equitable distribution judgment and disburse to Mr. B his share
of the tax refund check proceeds.

91. On March 18, 1997, over five months after the hearing on equitable
distribution and over one month after he had been order to file the order, Godwin

Mr. B owed to Godwin's client, Ms. B, by $250 as compensation to Mr. B for the
expense and inconvenience caused by Godwin's delay.
