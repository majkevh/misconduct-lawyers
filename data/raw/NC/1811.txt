)

***.********************************
This m~tter coming before the undersigned heating committee of the Disciplinary
Hearing Commission pursuant to Article IX, Section 14(H) of the Rules and Regulations
of the North Carolina State Bar; and it °appearing that the parties have agreed to waive

a

formal hearing in this matter; and it further appearing that.tbe parties stipulate and .agree
to the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the heating committee
therefore enters the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT
1.

The North ":.>oJ.·olina State Bar is a body duly organized under the laws of
North CaroE.i~-:a and is the proper party to bring this proceeding under the
authority gra::o~~ed it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North Carolina,
and the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar promulgated

I

thereunder.
2.

Defendant, Michael R Birzon, was admitted to the North Carolina State Bar
on September 24, 1975 and Was at all times relevant hereto an attorney at
law licensed to practice in North Carolina subject to the rules, regulations,
and Rules of Professional Conduct of the North Carolina State Bar and the
laws of the Stateoof North Carolina.

3.

During all times relevant hereto, defendant was actively engaged in the
practice of law in the City of Wilson, Wilson County, North Carolina.

O~

4,

February 15, 1989, Mr. Norwood G. Cobb ("Cobb") was injured in an
automobile accident on U.S~ Highway 301 North in Nash County, N:.C!
when the car in Which he was driving collided with a t:t;'a~tor-tr3:iler truck
driven by Ralph D~lVis Fisher, Jr... ("Fisher") and· owned by Interm<)del
Services, Inc. ("Intermodel"). Fisher and lntermodel denied liability and
asserted a defense of contributory negligence.

5.

On. July 20, 1989, Cobb hired defendant to represent him in a claim against
Fisher and Intermodel for injuries resulting from the February 15, 1989
accident. Pursuant to an employment agreement, Cqpb agreed tOP!lY
defendant one-third of any amount recovered from Fisher and/or Intermodel
as attorney's fees.

6.

On or about April 3, 1992, Cobb agreed to settle hi~ claim again~t Fisher and
Intermodel for $85,000. Pursuant to the employment contract, d~fenc;lant
was entitled to one-third of the settlement proceeds, or $28,333.33.

7.

Prior to settlement, Medicare had clabned a lien in the amount of $19,645.13
for payments made on behalf of Cobb as a result of the February 15, 1989
accident. Cobb contested the amount owed' under the Medicare lien.
Respondent, on behalf of Cobb, examined Cobb's medica.l records and
determined that some of the Medicare payments were. not related to the
February 15, 1989 accident. As a result of respondent's effoi;'ts, ·.the
Medicare lien amount was reduced to $15,880.52.·

8.

In addition, pursuant to 42 CFR Sec. 411.37, Medicare wa~ required to
reduce its lien from $15,880.52 to $10,587.02 .. 42 CFR Sec. 411.37
requires Mrdicare to reduce its lien amount in all case~ in which liapility is
contested ~nd the subscriber is forced to incur costs, sucb. asattorney;s tees,
,to procure ~payment from a third party payor. The~e costs are termed
"procurement costs." The purpose of the Medic;lfe reduction is to belp
defray the subscriber's procurement costs.

9.

Pursu!lnt to 42 CFR Sec. 411.37, the Medicare lien amount is reduced by the
ratio of the procurement costs (attorney's fees) to the settlement amount. In
Cobb's case, respondent's attorney'.s fees were one-third of the settlement
amount. Therefore, Medicare reduced its lien by one-third ($5,293.50)
leaving a balance owed of $10,587.02 instead of $15,880.52. Absent some

• .agreeme:;.:.: to the contrary, the $5,293.50 reduction amooot should have been
, paid to' '~obb to reduce his procurement costs (attorney's fees) from
$28,333.33 to $23,039.83.
10.

11.

: Birzon mistakenly believed that he was entitled to the reduction amount of
$5,293.50 for his time reviewing Cobb's medical records and securing a
• reduction in the Medicate lien from $19,645.13 to $15,880.52 and/or as a
: fee ftom Medicare for protecting its lien. Based upon his belief, Birzon, in
addition to the $28,333.33 fee he was entitled to from the $85,000 settlement
. proceeds, paid himself an additional fee of $5,293.50 instead of paying these
funds to Cobb.

I

On August 10, 1992, after learning that Cobb was questioning Birzon's
: handling. .of the $5,293.50, Birzon voluntarily sent Cobb a check for

i

$5,293.51.
Based upon tJ:. .:'- foregoing FINDINGS OF FACT the Committee makes the
j

following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.

2.

By taking the $5,293.50 Medicare reduction amount which he believed he
,was entitled to but was not, Bitzon violated Rule 2.6 of the Rules of
. Professional Conduct.
I

By depositing the $5,293.51 belonging to Cobb into his office account,
Birzon violated Rule 10.1(A) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.
