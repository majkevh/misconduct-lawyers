WILLIAM T. BATCHELOR, II, Attorney,
Defendant
This matter was heard on May 9, 2014 before a Hearing Panel ofthe Disciplinary
Hearing Commission ("DHC") composed of Steven D. Michael, Chair, and members
Beverly T. Beal and Scott A. Sutton. Plaintiff was represented by G. Patrick Murphy.
Defendant, William T. Batchelor, II ("Batchelor" or "Defendant"), was represented at the
hearing by Terry Richard Kane.
Prior to the hearing, the Hearing Panel granted summary judgment in favor of the
State Bar concluding as a matter oflaw that Defendant violated the Rules of Professional
Conduct as alleged in paragraphs a) through g), and i) andj) of the State Bar's
Complaint. Based on the Hearing Panel's summary judgmeut order, the sole issue
remaining for determination of what, ifany, discipline is appropriate for the established
rule violations came on for hearing.
Based on the Complaint, the Answer, the Order of Summary Judgment, the
Stipulations of the parties, and the exhibits and evidence admitted during the hearing,
there is no material dispute concerning the following facts:
1.
Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar ("State Bar"), is a body duly
organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this
proceeding under the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North
Carolina, and the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar (Chapter 1 of
Title 27 of the North Carolina Administrative Code).
2.
Defendant, William T. Batchelor, II, was admitted to the North Carolina
State Bar on March 21, 1986, and is, and was at all times referred to herein, an attorney at
law licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the laws of the State of North
Carolina, the Rules and Regulatious ofthe North Carolina State Bar and the Rules of
Professional Conduct.

3.
Defendant was properly served with process and the matter came before
the Hearing Panel with due notice to all parties.
4.
During all or part of the relevant periods referred to herein, Batchelor was
engaged in the practice of law in the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office
in Wilmington, New Hanover County, North Carolina.
5.
Between January I, 2007 and June 30, 2010, Defendant had two trust
accounts associated with his law practice: an account with Branch Banking & Trust
Bank, account number ending in the digits 3231 ("TA 3231"), and an account with RBC
Bank, account number ending in the digits 3840 (HTA 3840").
6.
Before August 2009, Defendant maintained BB&T TA 3231. Defendant
opened RBC TA 3840 in August 2009 but did not close BB&TTA 3231. Defendant
took $1,000.00 from BB&T TA 3231 and transferred that amount to open RBC TA 3840.
Defendant did not identify the owner(s) of the $1,000.00 he moved from BB&T TA 3231
to RBC TA 3840.
7.
Deposit slips for RBC TA 3840 show that Defendant failed to always
identify the source and the name of the client or other person to whom the funds belonged
for cash deposits to RBC TA 3840.
8.
During the period January 1,2007 and June 30, 2010, it was Defendant's
practice to collect a flat expense charge from clients to cover his costs for mail, postage,
paper and printer cartridges ("expense charge"). The expense charge collected to cover
these costs was either $16.00 or $25.00, depending on the case, and the money collected
from the client was deposited into the trust account Defendant was using at the time.
9.
The flat expense charge referenced in paragraph 8 was collected from
clients ilTespective of the actual cost Defendant incurred handling an individual client's
case.
10.
Between January 1, 2007 and August 31, 2009, Defendant used BB&TTA
3231 checks to disburse funds to suppliers for office supplies, expenses and equipment.
These checks were WTitten directly to the suppliers and not to Defendant.
11.
Between August 1, 2009 and June 30, 2010, Defendant used a trust
account check card to disburse funds from RBC TA 3840 to suppliers of office supplies
and equipment. These check card disbursements were made directly to the suppliers.
12.
When Defendant disbursed trust account funds by check or check card to
vendors for office supplies, expenses or equipment, he arbitrarily apportioned the costs
amongst clients with expense charge balances in his trust account as shown on client
cards.
13.
Defendant did not always indicate on checks drawn on BB&T TA 3231
and made payable directly to suppliers the client funds against which they were drawn.

-2-

14.
Between January I, 2007 and June 30,2010, Defendant failed to properly
conduct monthly reconciliations of the balance of BB&T T A 3231 as shown on his
records with the current bank statement balance for BB&T TA 3231 as required by the
Rules of Professional Conduct.
15.
Between January I, 2007 and June 30, 2010, Defendant failed to properly
conduct quarterly reconciliations of the individual client balances shown on the ledger for
BB&T T A 3231 with the current bank statement balance for BB&T TA 3231 as required
by the Rules of Professional Conduct.
16.
Between August 1,2009 and June 30, 2010, Defendant failed to properly
conduct monthly reconciliations of the balance ofRBC TA 3840 as shown on his records
with the current bank statement balance for RBC TA 3840 as required by the Rules of
Professional Conduct.
17.
Between August 1, 2009 and June 30,2010, Defendant failed to properly
conduct quarterly reconciliations of the individual client balances shown on the ledger for
RBC TA 3840 with the current bank statement balance for RBC TA 3840 as required by
the Rules of Professional Conduct.
In accordance with the Order of Summary Judgment, the Hearing Panel makes the
following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.
All parties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the Panel has
jurisdiction over Defendant and over the subject matter of this proceeding.
2.
Defendant's conduct constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C.
Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(2) as follows:
a. By opening RBC TA 3840 in August 2009 with the transfer of $1 ,000.00
from BB&T TA 3231 without identifying the cIient(s) for whom the
entrusted funds were being held, Defendant failed to properly identify
entrusted funds in violation of Rule 1.I5-2(a) and Rule 1.15-3(b)(1);
b. By failing to list on deposit slips the source and the name of the client or
other person to whom the funds belonged, Defendant failed to properly
identify entrusted funds in violation of Rule 1.15-2(a) and Rule 1.153(b)(l);
c. By charging clients a flat expense charge of either $16.00 or $25.00
irrespective of the actual cost Defendant incurred in handling an individual
client's case, Defendant charged and collected a clearly excessive amount
for expenses in violation of Rule 1.5(a);
d. By paying vendors directly for expenses and equipment with trust acconnt
checks and trust account check cards, Defendant failed to make items

-3-

drawn on his trust accounts for payment of expenses payable to himself in
violation of Rule 1.15-2(h);
e. By failing to conduct monthly reconciliations of the balance of his trust
accounts as shown on his records with the monthly bank statement balance
for his trust accounts, Defendant violated Rule 1.15-3(d)(2);
f. By failing to reconcile the individual client balances shown on the ledgers
of Defendant's general trust accounts with the current bank statements for
Defendant's trust accounts on a quarterly basis, Defendant failed to
conduct requisite reconciliations of his trust accounts in violation of Rule
1.15-3(d)(l);
g. By drawing checks on his trust account without always identifying on the
checks the client balance against which the item was drawn, Defendant
violated Rule l.lS-3(b)(2); and
h. By collecting a standard expense charge from clients and depositing those
funds in his trust account, Defendant failed to hold and maintain entrusted
property separate from the property of Defendant in violation of Rule
1.15-2(a) and Rule 1.15-2(f).
Based upon the foregoing undisputed material facts and Conclusions of Law, the
Stipulations of the parties, and the exhibits and evidence admitted during the hearing, the
Hearing Panel hereby finds by clear, cogent and convincing evidence, the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
Defendant was licensed to practice law in North Carolina on March 21,
1986, and since that time has been engaged in private practice.
2.
Defendant's mismanagement of his trust account resulted in numerous
violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.
3.
Defendant's failure to comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct
when handling entrusted funds has the potential to cause significant harm to clients of
Defendant and to the public's perception of the legal profession.
4.
Defendant presented character letters from colleagues in the practice of
law and clients attesting to his good character.
5.
Defendant has prior discipline from the Grievance Committee and
Disciplinary Hearing Commission of the North Carolina State Bar, and discipline and
sanctions from the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of North
Carolina as follows:
a. Reprimand by the DHC in 90 DRC 13;
b. Reprimand by the Grievance Committee in 07G0198;

-4-

c. Order to return fees and suspension from filing petitions in Bankruptcy
Court for approximately one month in In re: Daniels, 09-02547-8 (March
12,2010); and
d. Reprimand and monetary sanction in In re: Amra, 0-04882-8 (November
5,2010).
6.
A cornerstone of client trust in an attorney is that the attorney will
properly protect and maintain entrusted funds. Failure to do so erodes the confidence
clients place in attorneys who handle their affairs and harms the profession as a whole.
7.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fonns of
discipline available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and
disbannent, in considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
Based on the undisputed material facts and Conclusions of Law above and the
additional Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fonns of
discipline available to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง.0114(w)(l) of the Rules and Regolations of the North
Carolina State Bar and concludes the following factors are present which warrant
suspension of Defendant's license:

a. Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential hann is
foreseeable, to wit: failing to comply with trust account rules to ensure
proper maintenance of and accounting for entrusted funds;
b. Elevation of Defendant's own interest above that ofhls clients; and
c. Negative impact of Defendant's actions on the client's or public's
perception of the legal profession.
2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง.0114(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes no factors are present in this instance that would warrant disbarment.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. lB ยง.0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
a. Prior disciplinary offenses in this state and the United States Bankruptcy
Court;
b. Pattern of misconduct;

-5-

c. Multiple offenses;
d. Full and free disclosure to the Hearing Committee and Defendant's
cooperative attitude toward the proceedings;
e. Defendant's good character and reputation with lawyers in his community
and with clients as presented in letters written on his behalf; and
f. Substantial experience in the practice oflaw.
4.
Defendant's failure to properly maintain, manage and handle entrusted
funds betrays a vital trust that clients and the public place in attorneys and the legal
profession.
5.
The Hearing Panel has considered issuing an admonition, reprimand or
censure but concludes that such discipline would not be sufficient discipline because of
the gravity of the potential significant harm to the clients. The Panel further concludes
that such discipline would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses committed
by Defendant and would send the wrong message to attorneys regarding the conduct
expected of members of the Bar in this State.
6.
This Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and concludes that a
suspension is appropriate under the facts and circumstances of this case to address the
potential for significant harm to Defendant's clients, and for the protection of
Defendant's clients and the public.

7.
For these reasons, this Hearing Panel finds that an order imposing
discipline less than a suspension of Defendant's law license would not be appropriate.
Based upon the foregoing, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
