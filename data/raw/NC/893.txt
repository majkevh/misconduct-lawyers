ORDER OF DISBARMENT

THIS MATTER was heard by the Council of the North Carolina State Bar
pursuant to 27 N.C.A.C. 1B §.0117 (a) of the State Bar Discipline and Disability Rules
upon the affidavit of tender of surrender of license executed by Matthew A. Marino on
June 29, 2009, and filed in the offices of the State Bar on July 10,2009.
Based on the affidavit, the Council finds that on September 3, 2008, Matthew A.

restitution. This conduct constitutes grounds for discipline, under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 8428 (b)(1) and (b)(2), in that Marino violated Rule 8.4 of the Revised Rules of
Professional Conduct.
WHEREFORE, upon motion made and duly seconded, the Council enters the

accepted.
2. Matthew A. Marino hereby is DISBARRED from the practice of law in North

Matthew A. Marino, being first duly sworn, deposes and says as follows:
1. I desire to resign and hereby tender rny license to practice law in North Carolina

2. My resignation is freely and voluntarily rendered, and is not the result of coercion or
duress. I am fully aware of the implications of submitting my resignation.
3. I am aware that there is a pending investigation by the State Bar regarding allegations
that on September 3, 2008, I pled guilty in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York to one count of misprision of a felony, and that on April 21, 2009 I was
sentenced to serve 21 months in prison and ordered to pay a total of $60,000,000.00 in
restitution.
4. I acknowledge that the material facts upon which the investigation is predicated are
true.
5. I am submitting my resignation because I know that if disciplinary charges were
predicated upon the misconduct under investigation, I could not successfully defend against
them.
