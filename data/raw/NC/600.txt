ORDER OF REPRIMAND

By an Order to Show Cause issued on June 26, 2014, the COUlt initiated disciplinary
proceedings against respondent Kenneth A. Free, a member of the NOlth Carolina bar and the bar
of this COUlt, arising from his failure to file a notice of appeal on behalf of his criminal client.!
The Court held a hearing on August 5, 2014, at which Mr. Free appeared and admitted that he
violated professional conduct rules by neglecting to file a notice of appeal on his client's behalf.
The Court finds that Mr. Free's conduct violated the applicable rules of professional conduct and
imposes a public reprimand.
Lawyers practicing in NOlth Carolina and in the Middle District of North Carolina owe
their clients duties of competence, diligence, and communication. See North Carolina Rules of
Professional Conduct 1.1, 1.3,1.4; see also L.R. 83.10e(b) (adopting the Code of Professional
Responsibility adopted by the Supreme Court ofNOlth Carolina). In the Fourth Circuit, "[e]very
attorney, including retained counsel, who represented a [criminal] defendant in the district court
shall continue to represent the client after termination of those proceedings, unless relieved of
further responsibility" by the Fourth Circuit. Plan of the United States Court of Appeals for the

! The Court acts pursuant to Local Rule 83.l0e and Local Criminal Rules 57.1 and 57.3 and
in its inherent authority. See, e.g., Chambers v. NASCa, Inc., SOl U.S. 32, 43 (1991) (noting
federal courts have the inherent authority to control admission to their bars and to discipline
attorneys who appear before them).

Fourth Circuit in Implementation of the Criminal Justice Act at 6; see also L.R. 83.l(e)(J). This
includes the duty to file a timely notice of appeal on the defendant's request. Fourth Circuit Plan
at 6; see, e.g., Richardson v. United States, 612 F. Supp. 2d 709, 716 (N.D.W. Va. 2009)
(holding retained attorney owed petitioner duty to file appeal); see also Hernandez v. United

States, Civil No.1 : 12-cv-00044-MR, 2013 WL 388984, at *1-2 (W.D.N.C. Jan. 30,2013)
(holding retained counsel's failure to file notice of appeal on defendant's request is per se
ineffective assistance).
Based on Mr. Free's admissions and the matters of record in case number 12-cr-00068,
including the Court's previous finding that Mr. Free provided ineffective assistance of counsel to
his client, (No. 12-cr-00068, Docs. 32-1, 37, 39), the Court finds by clear and convincing
evidence that Mr. Free violated his duties of competence, diligence, and communication by
failing to file a notice of appeal for his client knowing that his client wanted to exercise his right
to appeal. See North Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1, 1.3, 1.4; see also Rules 8.4(a),

(d).
Sanctions, including disbarment, suspension, fine, public reprimand, and private
reprimand (admonition), are appropriate when attorney misconduct has been proven by clear and
convincing evidence. See In re Liotti, 667 F.3d 419, 426 (4th Cir. 2011 ) (citing with approval
the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions). In determining
whether and what sanctions are appropriate, the court should consider the ethical duty violated,
the lawyer's mental state, the extent of actual or potential injury caused by the misconduct, and
any aggravating or mitigating factors. ABA Standards § 3.0; see also Liotti, 667 FJd at 426.
At the show cause hearing, Mr. Free testified that he did not file the notice of appeal
because he was unaware of the Fourth Circuit's continuous duty rule. He also testified that he

has not attended any of the continuing education programs offered by the Federal Defender in
this district even though he was aware of those programs. The Court accepts this testimony and
finds that the violation of the Rules was negligent rather than intentional. Nonetheless, Mr. Free
did not overlook filing the notice of appeal or miss the deadline; rather he acted knowingly and
deliberately in failing to file the notice of appeal. The violation actually injured Mr. Free's
client, necessitating retention of new counsel to file a petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. (See No.
12-cr-00068, Docs. 30, 31, 33.) Though the Court resolved the petition relatively swiftly, Mr.
Free's negligence caused delays and expense to his client and required time and resources from
the government, who had to respond to the §2255 motion, and from the Court.
Mr. Free's violation is mitigated by his zealous representation up until the point he failed
to file the notice of appeal, by his remorse, and by the absence of a prior disciplinary record. See
ABA Standards § 9.32(a). It is also mitigated somewhat by his relative inexperience in federal
court. See id. at § 9.32(f). However, his inexperience in federal court does not excuse him from
knowing his duties under the rules ofthis Circuit and the United States Constitution. See id. §
9.22(i). Indeed, his substantial experience in state court criminal practice and his failure to
undeliake sufficient professional education or study to familiarize himself with the differences
between state and federal court practice before appearing in the Middle District are aggravating.
The Court has considered a range of options, including a private admonition. Private
sanctions are generally only appropriate when the conduct "causes little or no actual or potential
injury to a client." Id. §§ 4.44, 4.54, 4.64. As stated above, this is not such a case. Moreover,
the ABA guidelines endorsed by the Fourth Circuit seem to contemplate private admonitions
only by state disciplinary authorities such as the State Bar. See ABA Model Rule for Lawyer
Disciplinary Enforcement 10.1(5). Finally, courts operate in the public arena and not in secret,

3

Case 1:14-mc-00040 Document 4 Filed 08/12/14 Paae 3 of 4

and the legal profession and the public are best served by public opinions explaining the
imposition of sanctions. See ABA Standards at Part LA. While there might be a case where a
private admonition from a court would be appropriate, this is not one of them.
The Court finds that the appropriate sanction is a public reprimand, subject to the
completion within one year of eight hours of continuing legal education in the specific area of
federal criminal practice, offered in a program or programs presented by the Federal Defender of
the Middle District or otherwise approved by the NOlth Carolina State Bar. See id. § 2.8(1)
(listing continuing education courses as permissible sanction). This sanction is an appropriate
response to misconduct which caused actual harm to a client, is sufficient to deter future
violations by Mr. Free and others, and offers protection to the public.

It is therefore ORDERED that:

(I) Attorney Kenneth Free is REPRIMANDED for violating his professional duties as a
lawyer by failing to file a notice of appeal for his client who asked him to do so.
(2) By August 12, 2015, Mr. Free must proffer to the COUIt evidence that he has
completed eight (8) hours of continuing legal education in the specific area of federal
criminal practice, offered in a program or programs presented by the Federal
Defender of the Middle Distdct or othelwise approved by the NOlth Carolina State
Bar. Failure to do so will subject Mr. Free to reconsideration of the matter.
(3) The Clerk shall provide a copy of this Order to all Distdct Judges and Magistrate
Judges in the Middle Distdct and to the NOlth Carolina State Bar.
This the 12th day of August, 2014.
