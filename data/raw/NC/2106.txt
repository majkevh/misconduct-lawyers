FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. $20,000 of the funds that defendant Winfrey used to make restitution to Pierce
was derived from a mortgage placed on real property belonging to Frances Coan and
Coan's daughter, Pamela Hanks. After Hanks obtained the mortgage proceeds in late
1998, she gave the funds to defendant Winfrey, who was then representing Hanks.
2. 'W~!!frey i!'I9~ed the 'mortgag~ t,roceeds in a-personal bank account at Central
qrrroU!\8- B?:«:::-,; a:?d ne ;'~.e;::p. ~r~nsfe::-0,n~ L"~e funds to another personal account at Branch
Banking & Tm,st Co..'
.

I

3. On. January 29, 1999, Com filed a civil action against her daughter Hanks,
claiming, among other things, that Hanks had fraudulently obtained the $20,000 in
mortgage proceeds. On the same date, Coan also obtained a temp()rary restraining order·
that forbade Hanks and her attorney from disbursing any portion of the mortgage
proceeds.
4. Coan's attorney, David C. Smith, advised defendant Winfrey on the morning
of January 29, 1999 that Smith plann~d to file suit against Hanks and intended to seek a
temporary restraining order to prevent disbursement of the mortgage proceeds and other
funds claimed by Coart. Smith invited defendant Winfrey to attend a hearing on the
injunction issue. Winfrey indicated that he wished to be heard before an injunction was
entered, bll;t he claimed that he was having car trouble. Instead of appearing in court on
January 29, 1999, Winfrey withdrew the $20,000 in mortgage proceeds from his personal
account and used these funds to purchase a cashier's check made payable to Pierce. He
then gaVe this check to Pierce to repay her for the misappropriated funds.

5: Winfrey's misconduct is mitigated by the following factor:
a. good character and reputation in his home community.

I

6. Winfrey's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
a. Winfrey was motivated by selfishness and dishonesty;
b. Winfrey engaged in a pattern of misconduct;

.

C. .

Winfrey engaged in mUltiple acts of misconduct;

d. Winfrey had substantial experience in the .practice of law at the time of
