located at 8041 Bartee Bridge Road, Saratoga, North Carolina.

Blake was not entitled to use the Speight Estate funds fOl' personal

29.
In an email dated JanualY 14,2016, Reece inquired of Blake regarding the
whereabouts of the proceeds from the sale of the McKeel falIDpropelty.
30.
In a reply email that same day, Blake stated: "The funds from the sale are
in excess of $315,000 and have remained in my trust account since the closing."
31.
Blake's statement to Reece that the McKeel farm sale proceeds had
remained in his trust account since tile closing was false.
32.
Reece became concenled about Blake's handling ofthe Speight Estate and
contacted the State Bar in Janualy 2016.
33.
State Bar Deputy Counsel and a State Bar Investigator contacted Blake by
phone on January 27, 2016.
34.
In the January 27 1h phone conversation, Blake asserted to Deputy Counsel
that the approximate $300,000.00 from the sale of the McKeel farm property remained in
his firm's trust account.
35.
Blake indicated he was willing to provide his trust account bank statement
to the State Bar to cOIl'oborate his assertion that the funds remained in trust. .
36.
Deputy Counsel sent Blake an email on January 27, 2016 following up on
the conversation and requesting that Blake provide the most recent bank statement for his
trust account, the client ledger for the Speight Estate, the settlement statement from the
sale ofthe McKeel farm propelty, the proceeds of which Blake represented were in trust,
2013 Estate account bank records, 2014-2015nust account bank records, and a qUalterly
reconciliation of his nust account for the fourth qualter of 20 15.
37.
On January 28, 2016, Blake responded to the email and stated he would
provide most of what was requested by February 2, 2016.
38.
On January 31, 2016, Blake emailed the State Bar numerous bank
statements for the Estate account, Blake Law Firm, PLLC invoices for atlonley's fees, a
draft final accounting and other documents related to the Speight Estate. Blake did not,
however, provide any bank statements for the tlUst account that purportedly contained the
proceeds from the McKeel.farm propelty sale.
39.
In response to the State Bar's request for a quarterly reconciliation of his
trust account for the fourth quarter of2015, Blake provided a one page document listing
clients and purported balances, but no indication of or compatison with the bank
statement balance for the trust account. The document provided failed to contain all
elements required in a quatterly reconciliation pursuant to Rule I.lS-3(d)(J), and
continued to withhold the information sought by the State Bar concerning the balance of
his trust account.

Order of Discipline

40.
Deputy Counsel and a State Bar Investigator spoke with Blake on
February I, 2016 about the need for Blake to produce the most recent bank statement for
the trust account which purportedly contained the McKeel farm pl'Opelty proceeds. Blake
indicated he would provide it and stated he hoped to be able to get the trust account bank
statement to the State Bar by mid-day the following day, Febl'Uary 2,2016.
41.
On February I, 2016, Deputy Counsel sent Blake a confirmation email
confirming the February.1'1 conversation.
On February 2, 2016, at about 8:02 am, Blake responded to the State Bar's
42.
confirmation e-mail by stating that his father was in recovery from surgery and that at
some point on February 2, 2016 he would return to Wilson for a change of clothes and
would send the requested documents at that time.
43.
Deputy Counsel responded to Blake's email on February 2, 2016 and
emphasized the need for him to provide, that day, "a complete and accurate copy" of the
most recent trust account bank statement. Deputy Counsel also informed Blake that "if
that bank statement fails to confirm your assertion that those sales proceeds for the
Speight estate are in your trust account, and have been properly maintained in your bank
account, the State Bar will seek a TRO"."
44.
On FebrualY 3, 2016, Blake sent the State Bar an email stating that he had
gone to the bank that morning and obtained "the attached from the bank reflecting the
trust balance."
45.
Attached to Blake's February 3rd email was a docnment reflecting that the
balance in the trust account on February 3,2016 at 1:14:08 pm was $331,168.09.
46.
Blake did not produce the most recent trust account bank statement as the
State Bar had requested and as he had agreed to do.
47.
Had Blake produced the trust account bank statement for January 2016 01'
December 2015, either statement would have shown that the Speight Estate funds from
the sale of the McKeel falm propelty were not in the trust account as Blake had asserted
to Reece and the State Bar.
On February 3, 2016, Blake transferred $290,536.48 ii'om his "cost
48.
advance account" to the trust account and $380.45 from his operatiog account to the trust
account.
49.
Prior to Blake making the transfers referred to in the preceding pal'agraph,
there was $40,631.61 in his trust account.
50.
Blake's transrers to the tmst account on February 3rd produced a tmst
acco,mt balance of $331,548.63.
Blake's transfers allowed him to provide the State Bar with a document
51.
showing a balance of$331,168.09 in the tmst account.

The North Carolina State Bar v. Paul N. Blake, III, 16 DHC 35
Order of Discipline

52.
Blake made these h·ansfers and provided a document showing that balance
in an attempt to support his false statement that he had continuously maintained the
McKeel farm sale proceeds in his trust account since the settlement date.
53.
Blake misappropriated funds belonging to the Speight Estate from about
November 2014 to FeblUary 2016.
54.
On February 4, 2016, Blake consented to an order of prelimin[!ry
injunction enjoining him from handling entlUsted funds.
55.
The consent order of preliminary injunction required Blake to produce
trust account records requested by the State Bar.

On February 8, 2016, the State Bar requested that Blake submit complete
56.
bank records for his trust account and operating account for the time period of December
1, 2012-the date of production, including all original bank statements, original canceled
checks (front and back), wire transfer confirmations (identifying each transfer by client's
name), deposit tickets, and debit & credit memos. The State Bar requested that Blake
furnish these documents no later than Wednesday, February 10,2016.
57.
On FebJuary 9, 2016, Blake requested an extension until FeblUary 17,
2016 to produce the records and the State Bar agreed to the extension.
58.
Blake produced some of the requested bank records on FeblUary 11,2016
and additional records on February 17, 2016. However, the records Blake produced were
incomplete.
59.
In addition to being incomplete, the records Blake provided in February
2016 were false. For example, he provided a purported reconciliation for May 2015 that
showed that the Speight Estate had a balance of $325,698.13 in his trust account when
the bank statement he provided showed a trust account balance of $273,329.05, far less
than the amount he should have had for the Speight Estate.
Attorney Fees
60.
In approximately December 2012, Blake engaged David Woodard
("Woodard"), an attorney with Connor, Bunn, Rogerson & Woodard, PLLC to handle
some legal matters for the Speight estate.
61.
In approximately April 2013, Blake joined Woodard's finn which then
became known as Connor, Bunn, Rogerson, Woodard, Fleming & Blake, PLLC.
62.
From February 2013 through September 2013, Blake disbursed estate
funds from the Estate account to pay attorney's fees for Woodard's legal services.
63.
The total amount Blake paid Woodal'd for his legal services through
September 2013 was $5,463.62.

64.
Blake also disbursed funds £i'om the Estate account by writing checks to
Blake Law Firm which he identified as attorney's fees.
65.
Blake provided Reece periodic invoices for his legal services covering the
time period from April 1, 2013 through May 29, 2014.
66.
1he invoices Blake provided Reece for the time period of April I, 2013
through May 29, 2014 in total indicated an amount of $29,585.00 due to Blake for his
legal services in addition to what was billed for Woodard's time.

the Speight Estate dated March 31, 2013, May 30, 2013, June 30, 2013, July 30, 2013,
August 30, 2013, September 30, 2013, October 31, 2013, November 30, 2013, December

31,2015.
70.

The invoices Blake provided the State Bar:
(a) wel'e on Blake Law Firm, PLLC letterhead;
(b) gave a total number of hours per month with no description of work
performed;
(c) did not include billing for legal assistants' time; and
(d) billed his time at $300.00 an hour.

71.

The invoices Blake provided Reece;
(a) were on the letterhead of Connor, Bunn, Rogerson, Woodard, Fleming
& Blake, PLLC, Blake Law Fh-m, PLLC, or Blake Curtner, PLLC;
(b) contained detailed descriptions of WOl'k petfolmed and time expended
for the work;
(c) included billing for legal assistants' time; and
(d) billed his time at $200.00 an hour.

72.
In addition, the total of hours per month and the amount of Blake's fee
differed between the two sets of invoices. For example, the invoice Blake provided Reece
for the month of April 2013 showed that he worked 41.4 hours for a total of $8,280.00
whereas the invoice he provided the State Bar for April 2013 showed that he worked 34
hours for a total of$1O,200.00.
73.
The invoices Blake provided Reece did not correspond with the actual
payments to Blake.
74.
At the time Blake provided to the State Bar the invoices described in
paragraph 63 above, he provided no explanation for the invoices being different from the
invoices he had provided Reece.
75.
Blake created the invoices he provided to the State Bar to correspond with
the amounts he had disbursed to himself from the Speight Estate funds and to mislead the
State Bal'.
76.
In an email to Reece dated January 26, 2016, Blake falsely stated: "I
haven't been paid any attorney fees since December 2013."

In fact, Blake paid Blake Law Film $17,053.50 on January 21, 2014.

78.
On the proposed final account for the Speight Estate which Blake prepared
and provided to the State Bar in late January 2016, he represented that the Speight Estate
had a balance of$346,618.15.
79.
In January 2016, Reece repeatedly asked Blake for an itemized accounting
of all legal fees he had billed and collected from the estate since January 2013.
80.

Blake did not comply with Reece's request.

81.
Blake did not provide invoices to Reece or othelwise notify Reece that he
had taken over $96,000.00 in attorney fees from the estate.
82.
In August of 2013, L.P. signed a contract for legal services with Connor,
Bunn, Woodard, Fleming & Blake, PLLC ("the firm") concel1ling representation in a
personal injury case arising from an automobile accident involving the vehicle L.P. was
driving and another vehicle.
83.
In accordance with the contract, the fim1 was entitled to 25% of any
amount recovered if L.P.'s claim was settled prior to a lawsuit being filed and 33
andl/3% of any amount recovered if the case was settled after the filing of a lawsuit.

In January 2015, Blake received a $30,000.00 settlement check from
84.
Universal Insurance Company, the liability call'ier for the driver of the vehicle involved
. in the accident with L.P.
85.
The $30,000.00 check was made payable to Paul N. Blake, III Law Film
PLLC, and L.P.
86.
$10,000.00.

Of the $30,000.00 of L.P. 's settlement funds, Blake was entitled at most to

87.
Blake informed L.P. that he would deposit the check, which contained
funds due Blake for his attomey's fee and funds due L.P. in settlement of his claim, into
his trust account pending fUlihel' action regarding an underinsured motorist claim.
88.

Blake did not deposit the $30,000.00 check into his trust account.

89.
Instead, Blake directed his paralegal to deposit the check into his "cost
advance account."
Blake's paralegal deposited the $30,000.00 check into his "cost advance
90.
account" on January 20, 20.1 5.
91.
Between January 20, 2015 and February 27,2015, Blake made numerous
disbursements from the "cost advance account," to himself and for his benefit, Including
nine checks totaling $6,212.00 written to cash and numerous internet transfers totaling

$6,448.00.

By February 27, 2015, the balance in the "cost advance account" was

93.
By depositing L.P.'s funds into his cost advance account, and then making
transfers to his personal bank account and writing checks f01" cash, Blake misappropriated
L.P.'s funds.
94.
In May of 2015, L.P. requested his funds from the settlement and Blake
gave him a check for $20,000.00. The check was written on an account that Blake
maintained with First South Bank that was not a trust account.
95.
In November 2012, Blake received a check for $134,167.76 which was to
be held by Blake in escrow pending the outcome of a civil action in which Blake
represented the plaintiff.
96.
The $134,167.76 represented entrusted funds which Blake was required to
deposit and maintain in an attorney trust account.
97.
From November 2012 until September 2015 when the $134,167.76 should
have been held in escrow in Blake's trust account, the balance in the trust account fell
well below$134,167.76, including as follows:
(a)

On May 9, 2013, Blake's trust account balance was $44,445.68;

(b)

On October 1, 2013, Blake's trust account balance was $37,641.84; and

The lawsuit refell'ed to in paragraph 95 was tried and the opposing party

100. Upon the completion of the lawsuit, the opposing party was entitled to the
$134,167.76.
101. On September 15, 2015, Blake disbursed $134,167.76 by wliting a check
drawn on his "cost advance account" and made payable to the opposing party and his
attorney.
102. On September 15,2015, Blake made an internet transfer of $139,000.00
from his trust account to his "cost advance account."

103. Prior to Blake making the transfer from his t!'Ust account to his cost
advance account refelTed to in paragraph 102, there was a balance of$365.88 in the cost
advance account
104. Blake used the ftmds transferred from his trust account to his cost advance
account to make the $134,167.76 payment to the opposing party.
105. Blake had not maintained these funds in escrow in his t!'Ust account, as
described in paragraph 97.
106. Blake misappropriated other entl'Usted funds in his t!'Ust account when he
transferred $139,000.00 from his trust account to his cost advance account and used those
funds to make the payment due to the opposing party.
107. PriOlo to the $139,000.00 transfer from the tmst account to the cost advance
account, the trust account balance was $247,317.71.

The transfer caused the trust account balance to full to $108,317.71.

109. Blake should have had at least $330,470.23 in his trust account for other
clients when he made the $139,000.00 transfer to his "cost advance accOlmt."

6.
Defendant, by engaging in conduct involving misappropriation for a
substantial period of time and by engaging in deceit in his dealings with his co-executor
and the State Bar has shown himself to be untmstworthy and his misconduct had a
negative impact on third parties and the administration of justice.

negatively affected by an attomey's misappropriation of entrusted funds.
8.

of experience, Defendant should have known better than to engage in these acts that have
led to the discipline imposed in this order.
10.
The Hearing Panel finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence any
additional facts that may be contained in the conclusions regarding discipline set out
below.

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional
Findings Regarding Discipline, the Heating Panel enters the following
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearlllg Panel carefully considered aU of the different forms of
discipline available to it.
2.
The Hearing Panel considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.
Admin:Code § IB.Ol14(w)(1), (2) and (3) and determined that the following factors are
applicable:
27 N.C. Admin. Code § lB.0114(w)(1) - Suspension or Disbalment Factors:

trustworthiness, 01' integdty;
(c) Factor (D), Elevation of Defendant's own interest above those of his

Order of Discipline

Page 15 of18

(f) Factor (ll), Negative impact on third parties;
(g) Factor (1), Acts of dishonesty, misrept'esentation, deceit or fabrication;
27 N,C. Admin, Code § IB,OI14(w)(2)· Disbarment Factors:
(h) FactOl' (A), Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication;
(i) Factor (C), Misappropriation or convet'sion of assets of any kind to which
Defendant or recipient was not entitled, whether from a client or any other
source;

27 N.C. Admin. Code § lB.Ol14(w)(3)· General Factors:
(k) Factor (A), No prior record of disciplinary offenses;

(1) Factor (C), Dishonest or selfish motive;
(m)Factor (F), A pattern of misconduct;
(n) Factor (0), Multiple offenses;

(0) Factor (K), Absence of full and free disclosure to the Hearing Panel or
cooperative attitude towards the proceedings;
(p) Factor (N) Submission of false evidence, false statements, or other
deceptive pmctices during the disciplinary process; and

(q) Factor (S), Substantial degree of experience in the practice oflaw.

3.
The factors present under 27 N.C, Admin, Code § IB.OI14(w)(l) and (2)
support imposition of disbarment in this case.
4.
Defendant caused significant halm to his clients and others for whom he
should have maintained entlUsted funds by misappropriating their entrusted funds.
Propel' maintenance and management of entrnsted funds is a cornerstone
5.
of the public's tlUst in thl( legal profession. Embezzlement is one of the most serious
offenses an attOlney can commit, betraying the client's trust in the attorney and the
public's trust in the legal profession, Defendant's misappropriation caused hanll to the
standing of the legal profession, undennining trust and confidence in lawyers and the
legal system,

Ol'del' of Discipline

Page 16 of18

6.
Defendant's repeated commission of criminal acts reflecting adversely on
his honesty, trustworthiness 01' fitness as a lawyer caused potential significant harm to the
legal profession, in that criminal conduct tends to bring the legal profession into
disrepute.
7.
Defendant's failure to pat1icipate in this disciplinary proceeding before the
DHC results in potential significant harm to the profession and to the public. The legal
profession is entrusted with the privilege of self-regulation. The State Bar can only
regulate the profession if its members participate. Defendant's failure to participate in
this disciplinary proceeding before the DHC shows an unacceptable disregard for the
regulatory authority of the State Bal'. Defendant's failure to paJlicipate in the
profession's self-regulation impedes effective self-regulation and jeopardizes the
privilege of the profession to remain self-regulating.
8.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and finds that
suspension of Defendant's license or a public censure, reprimand, 01' admonition would
not be sufficient discipline because of the gravity of the actual and potential harm to his
clients, the public, the administration of justice, and the legal profession caused by
Defendant's conduct, and the threat of potential significant harm Defendant poses to the
public.

9.
The Hearing Panel considered all lesser sanctions and finds that discipline
short of disbarment would not adequately protect the public for the following reasons:
(a) Defendant repeatedly engaged in criminal acts reflecting adversely on his
honesty, trustworthiness 01' fitness as a lawyer, and abused the trust placed
in him by his clients and others. Misappropriation of entrusted funds is
aJIlong the most serious misconduct in which an attol11ey can engage, and
demonstrates the attorney is not trustworthy;
(b) Defendant's dishonesty in his dealings with his co-executor and his
attempts to deceive the State Bar during the disciplinary process further
demonstrate his untrustworthiness;
(c) Entry of an order imposing less sel'ious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Defendant committed and
would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the
conduct expected of members of the North Carolina State Bar; and
(d) The protection of the public and the legal profession requires that
Defendant not be petwitted to resume the practice of law until he
demonstrates the following: that he has reformed; that he understands his
obligations to his clients, the public, and the legal profession; and that
pennitting him to practice Jaw will not be detrimental to the public or the
integrity and standing of the legal profession or the administration of

justice. Disbarred lawyel's are required to make such a showing before
they may resume practicing law.
