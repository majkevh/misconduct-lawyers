misconduct in file numbers 05G0982, 05G I043. 05G 1242. 05G 1316. 06G0236. and

In the fall of 2007, Elizabeth ColemanGray ("ColemanGray") of North

tdephone to request a copy or the trial transcript lor one or Del'endant's !ormer clients,
Alton Bagley ("Bagley'}
17.

Ddcndant did not respond to ColemanGray's requests.

18.
By letter dated 8 May :2008. ColemanGray again asked Defendant to
provide a copy of the transcript II'om Bagley's trial as well as a copy or Defendant's
clicnt llle on Bagley.
19.

Defendant did not respond to ColcmanGray's 8 May

~008

letter.

20.
In the summer or 2008, ColemanGray sought assistance from the "!orth
Carolina State liar in contacting Defendant regarding Bagley's transcript. By letters
dated 30 June 2008 and 15 July 2008, the North Carolina Statc liar asked Dcfendant to
respond to ColcmanGray immediately.
In mid-July 2008, Dcfendant Iell a \'oiccmailmessage with ColemanGray
21.
reganJingBagley's transcript and client tile. Dcrendant stated in his message that he
would deliver the transcript and client llie to ColemanGray. but did not do so.

Delcndant then sent ColemanGray a letter asking her to provide a signed
release from Bagley before he sent the IIIe materials. but the letter was addressed to an
incorrect post onlce box and ColemanGray did not receive it. ColemanGray did not
contact Defcndant after mid-July.
23.
On 19 March 2008, thc Chair of this hearing panel entered an ordcr
requiring Defendant to suhmit to a psychological evaluation. The ordcr rcquired
Defendant to "submit to a complete ... cxamination no later than May 30.2008.-24.
On 2() August 2008. Plaintiff tiled a motion to compel Defendant to
complete the psychological evaluation hy submitting to all psychological testing
recommcnded by the examining clinician. The Chair of this hearing pancl entered an
order compelling Defendant to complete the evaluation by 26 September 2008.
25.
On 2 October 2008, Defendant filed a molion to continue the hearing in
this matter because tbe psychological evaluation was not complete. Defendant's motion
to continue was granted and the hearing was postponed to 5 December 2008 lor tbe
purpose of completing the evaluation. The order granting Defendant's motion to
continue noted that "Defendant bears tbc responsibility lor the delay in tbe completion of
his psychological examination:' and further admonished Delcndant "that no further
continuances shall be allowcd, absent extraordinary cireulllstances"
26.
As of the 5 December 2008 hearing, Dclcndant had not completed the
psychological testing recommended by the cxamining clinician. and the psychological
evaluation ordered by this panel was therefore incompletc.
27.
Although the evaluating clinician was unable to render a clinical diagnosis
01' DcICndant, his testimony indicated that therc arc signiJlcant concerns regarding
DelcmJant's current condition which require runher inquiry.

~x,

Dekndant's treating therapists hased their diagnoses in part on the
sevcrity of Defendant's circumstances fmm 2004 onward, Defendant's PTSD features in
panieular stemmed both Ii-om childhood abuse and events during and after his marriage,
separation, and divorce,
Defendant self-reported his mental health issues to judges involved with
29,
his cases. the Appellate Defender who had appointed him to those cases, and to the Bar at
various times relevant to this maller. DcJendant accepted responsibility 1,)r his omissions
and failures, both client-related and with respect to responding tll thc flar.
30,
Defendant conceded in his testimony that hc was disahled during a perilld
of time that spanned from 2004 to 2006, but Defendant contested that he was disabled
aller 2006.
31.
Defendant's pattern of behavior after 2006, which has been 'virtually
idcntical to his behavior from 2004 to 2006, suggests an ongoing inability to carry out his
prolessional responsibilities due to an unspeeined. but persistent. mental condition.

32.
[n ordcr to protect the public. it is necessary for Defendant to identify and
obtain appropriate treatmcnt for the mental condition that has rendered him unable to
fulfill his professional responsihilities.
