7. On June ~, ~992, prior to the date on which the final

'
f.

At the time of the entry of the i989 Order qf
Discipline, Jones reasonably believed that he could repay ,the

upon the inoome from his la~ practice and proceeds, o! his
interest in the Bay: Tr~e Lake real estate development in Bladen
county.

, 13. Following entry of the May' 23, 1·989 Order' of Pis,ci,pl,ine,
circumstances qccurred which could not reasqnably have been,_,
, , foreseen by Jones and which were beyond his 'co:ntrol and wl1ich .
"prevented him from realizing any signi,ficant prqceeds front the
Bay ~ree Lake development.

19. The payments propos~d by Jones to ~s. Rackley set out in
paragraphs .17 and 18 would exceed the amount necessary to
atnortize the amount owed under the January 1984 promissory note.
The payments proposed by Jones wou'ld fall short of liquidating
the amount "owed under the :!.988 confession of jUdgment by
$20,069.72.

20. Jopes has agreed to make mqnthly interest payments to
the estate of Mildred F. Powell at the rate set out in 'the Dec.
70, 1985 promissory note~ as ~odified in the June 23, 1992
modification agreement for each the 36 months following the date
of this order.

21. Jones has agreed to pay the remaining principal owed to
the Powell estate pursuant to the Dec. 20, 1985 promissory note
as m6dified~ within 36.months of the date of this order.

represented to the Hearing Committee that they did not object to
Jones' motion.to extenq the stayed suspension period and mak~
additional payments to them as set out in paragraphs 17 - 21.
23 • If. the, suspension of Jon~s' law license is' activat~d, it
is unlikely that Jones would be able to continue to make payments
to Ms. Rackley and to the estatepf Mildred F. Powell.
CONCLUS'l:ONS OF LAW

1

In

1.
light of the unique facts Qf this case, it would be in
the best ini:;:erest of the public and the Bar to continue the
12-month stciyed suspension of Jones' law lieense for another 36
months, to penni t Jones to complete restitution to Ms. .Rackley
and to the estat~ of Mildred F. Powell.
2. Jones has demonstrated by clear, cogent and convincing
evidence that 'the May 23, 1989 order 'should be mod~fied to
suspend Jon~sj law license fora period of 12 months, stayed for
36 months fiom the date qf this order on the following
conditions: i
a.

That Jones pay $2,000 each month to the Clerk o'f
