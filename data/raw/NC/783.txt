responsive pleadings..

On February 16,2011, while his appeal of Judge Mullen's order was on appeal
to the 4th Circuit C01Ut of Appeals, Johnston filed a Complaint in Lincoln County Superior
Court in an action entitled Neil Alb'an, Terry Spoerle, Leslie Dale, et al., v. Graham C. Mullen
("Lincoln Lawsuit I") although Johnston kncw, or should have known, that Judge Gl'aham C.
Mullen was entitled to absolute immunity for the acts he was accused of in the Complaint.
4.
The Complaint Johnston filed in Lincoln Lawsuit I accused Judge Mullen of
violating the oath he took when he became a lawyer by dismissing the federal lawsuit in
violation ofthe Plaintiffs' constitutional right to a jury trial which Jolmston contended
constituted the felony of perjury in violation ofN.C.G.S. § 14-209.
5.
Also on February 16,2011, Johnston filed a Complaint in Lincoln County
Superior Court in an action entitled Neil Alb'an, Tel'lY Spoerle, Leslie Dale, e/ 01., v. Wells

Lawsuit II") seeking actual and punitive damages because the Defendants had filed a motion
for extension of time to file a response, in the federal lawsuit.

'The Complaint Johnston filed in Lincoln Lawsuit II accused the lawyer
Defendants of violating the oaths they took when they became lawyers by using their legal

Judge Boner's April 21, 2011 orders.

simultaneously to the otheqlarty in violdticin of Rule 3.5(a)(3)(B);
(e)
By failing to meet with and get the consent of persons on whose behalf

conduct prejudicial to the administration ofjustice in violation of Rule 8A(d).
BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and
additional evidence and arguments presented at the hearing, the undersigned enters the
following:
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
Although no prior disciplinary action has been taken against JolUlSton, the
pattern of misconduct exemplified by the specific instances exemplified by this order shows a
complete disregard for the integrity of the judicial system and the conseq1.1enCeS of his actions
to others.
I,
. \'.\ ,:
.. '

/: :ri.·

5

2.
Johnston intentionally engaged in conduct that foreseeably undermined the
public's faith in the judicial system. His unwalTanted attacks on the basic integrity of any
judge who ruled against him undennines the public's confidence in the judicial process.
3.
Johnston's baseless attacks on the integrity of judges caused embalTassment
and potential hatm to the judges' reputations.
4.
Joimston displayed abject disrespect for the judiciary and the judicial system in
public fonlms, including open cOUit with members of the public present. It is especially
damaging to the public's perception ofthe legal system when an officer· of the COUl't argues
with the COUit and demeans its patticipants.
5.
Johnston habitually violated both the letter and the spirit of Rule 12 of the
General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts in North Carolina by failing to
yield gracefully to rulings of the Court.
.' ..

,.

.

6.
By repeatedly filing lawsuits seelcing the same relief that the appellate cOUitS
had found to be without merit, Jolmston wasted the COUItS' time aud interfered with the
Courts' ability to carry out their duties to the people of this State.
7.
Iohnston testilled that he was committed to pursuing his unfounded cause,
showing that the judicial system and the public need to be protected from him having the
ability to bring more unfounded lawsuits and from doing further harm to the judicial system in
North CaTOlina.
8.
Johnston harmed his own clients by sUbjecting them to sanctions that he never
informed them about.
BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Court hereby enters the following additional
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
By making false allegations of fel~miolJs conduct on the pmt of judges and
fellow lawyers who opposed his lUlfounded allegation bl'Ought in federal court, Lincoln and
Gaston County Superior Courts and the North Cai'olina appellate cOUl1s, and by sending an ex
parte communication to Judge Bridges with a false; cettificate of service, Johnston has shown
himself to be a person who lacks the character ne:c~SSat·y to be a lawyer.
2.
Johnston's misconduct caused significatlt potential harm to the reputations of
lawyers and judges, and to the public's perception of the legal profession and the justice
system.
3.
Jollllston's misconduct caused significant potential harm to his clients by
subjecting them to significant monetat·y and other sanctions.

6

4.
This COUl1 has considered lesser alternatives and fInds that suspension of
Johnston's license or a public censure, reprini.and, or .admonition would not be sufficient
discipline because of the seriousness Qf Johnstoii~s inisconduct and the gravity of the actual
harm his conduct caused to the pubUc,the admii))stration of justice, and the legal profession
and because of the gravity of the signifIcant poteJ\tial hal'm to potential clients, the public, the
administration of justice, and the legal profession if Johnston were pClmitted to continue to
practicing law.
5.
This Court has considered all lesser sanctions and finds that discipline short of
disbalment would not adequately protect the public, the profession and the administration of
justice for the reasons set f011h above and for the following reasons:
(a)
Johnston committed misdeeds including material misrepresentations
and deceit. Misconduct involving misrepresentations and deceit are among the most
serious offenses that an attomey can commit. Such offenses demonstrate that the
offending attorney is not trustworthy. The public should be able to assume that all
lawyers are trustwolthy.
(b)
Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Johnston committed and would send the
wrong message to lawyers and to the public regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar of this State.
'. "
.
,

.

I:'...

l

(c)
Defendanthas.neither aGJqjowl~dged the wrongful nature of his
conduct nor expressed remorse for the significant halm he has caused. His conduct in
connection with this disciplinary proceeding suggests that he does not believe he has
done anything wrong and that he has no reason to feel remorseful. Accordingly, there
is an overwhelming likelihood that, ifhe were licensed to practice law, Johnston
would continue to engage in the pattern of misconduct that led to this disciplinary
action. So long as Johnston has a license to practice law, there is no way to protect
future potential clients fl'Om harm or to protect the judicial system and the profession
from deception and unwarranted attacks.
(d)
The protection of the public, the legal profession and the administration
of justice requires that Johnston not be permitted to resume the practice of law until he
demonstrates the following: that he has ref01med; that he understands his obligations
to his clients, the public, the legal profession and the administration of justice; and that
permitting him to practice law will not be detrimental to the public 01' the integrity and
standing of the legal profession or the administration of justice. Disbarred lawyers are
required to make such a showing before they may resume practicing law.
BASED UPON the foregoing Findings ofFilOt, Conclusions of Law, and additional
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, this Court hereby enters the
. ' . ,":, .
following:

7

ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

1.

5.
Before filing any action in any feueral 01' state court on his own behalf, other
than an app.eal of this Order of Discipline 01' any order that may be entered in the companion
contempt case before this Court, Johnston must accompany that filing with a sworn ceJiificate
from a lawyer licensed in N0l1h Carolina averring that the lawyer has reviewed the pleading,
that the lawyer believes, after reasonable inquiry, that the allegation.s in the pleading are well
grounded in fact and are warranted by existing law.
