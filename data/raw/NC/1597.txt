14. As af the time ef closing, "Stone and i~s agents and, ~i)lpioyees we-p9..:

signed a second deed of trust on the house.
15. The documents necessary to effect the closing ~.,rere signed by
Stanfield and his wife, and taken by Stanfield to the Sutphens for
signature, all on January 20, 1989.
16. After t~e closing documents were signed, Stanfield told Watkins
that Stanfield would pay for all closing costs rather than require the
Sutphens to pay the closi~g costs as set out o~ the typewritten Offer to
Purchase. Watkins did not revise the HUD-1 Settlement Statement to reflect
this change in allocation of closing costs.

I

17. Watkins believedat'the time of the closing and preparation of the
HUD-l Settlement Statement that the buyers, sellers and lender fu~ly
understood the nature of the transaction.. He d'id not pr~pa'ce the
Settlement Statement with the expectation or intention 01: defrauding or
deceiving the lender or any other person or entity, and he had no
expectation or intention that .his preparation of the Settlement Statement
would benefit any effort to deceive or misrepresent the nature of the
transaction.
18. Payments due on the loan by Stone have been paid and the loan has
not been declared in default.
19. Watkins did not :reco'gnize at the time of the closing and
preparation of the HUD-l :Settlement Statement that -the natUre of the
transaction could prove tio have adverse consequences to the int'erests of
the lender. Upon hecoming fully avIare of those conseque.nces and .the
potential harm ea:used by the inc'orrect recitals in the HUD..,..l Settlement
Statement, Watkins cause~ the statement to be corrected, reported that
correction to Stone, and ireported the circumstances to the North Carolina
State Bar.
.

,'-"

20. Watkins' law practice invoives principally personal injury 'and
District Court matters. 'He has limited experience in closing real estate
transactions, especially.HUD insured loans. The closing in question is the
only transaction he has ever handled for Stanfield or Stone. Watkins"
charged a normal closirtg.fee for the transaction and did not benefit
personally by the manner in which tpe Settlement Statemen,t was prepared or
how the closing ~..as handled.
Based on the foregoing
following:

incorre"ct information, and by failing to otherwise advise Stone of the .
existence of the second deed of trust and the actua1 payment going to the

decision on going forward "Tith the loan co!Umitment and d:~:sbursing the loan
proceeds, in violation of Rule 6(B)(2), and undertook representation of a
legal matter which ,he knew or should have known he was not competent to

1p. November or December of 1988,' you undertook to"provide
services to close the purchase of real prop~rty by Roger Stanfie14.
Sometime thereafter, you received f~om Stahfield'a partly handwritten,
partly typed Offer to Purchase and Contract; dated Sept. Z2., 198.8 and sign.e:d
by Stanfield on behalf of Insu Spec Inc. as buyer and Earl and .Nellie
Sutphen as sellers. The Offer to Purchase provided that the, contract sales
price was $40,000 a-qd that the Offer was subject to a construction loan
commitment of $65,000. The document s~rved to idel!-tify for you t.he property
being purchased and the current owners in order' to begin the title

The title examination proved to be' complex. the prgperty was the'
stibjec·t, of a life estate in favor 0,£ ParmeleeG~~Lucas Perry; one 0'£ the

Shortly before January 2.0, 1989, you 'receiv~d

from Stone Mortgage Company (hereafter, St-on~) ,which includE}d:, ainQng' oth~.r' , "

$65,000 purchase price and an appraisal by a HUD appraiser 'of $65,000.
Prior to the closing, Stanfield told you ~hat the contract sales price
for the house was $65,000 and that the Sutphens would receive $35,000 at
closing for the house •. Stanfield al90 told you that the Sutphens had also
agreed to give him the $1.;5,000 difference between ·the loan amount and the
~ales price as an allO\yance for improvements to get the house prepared for
sale at or above $65,000. Finally, S·tanfield told you that he had agreed
to give the Sutphens a second deed of trust on the property and that the
Sutphens had agreed to structure the sale to Stanfield as Stanfield had
e~plained -it to you.

I

Thereafter, 'you prepared and signed a HUD-l Settlement Statement which
you submitted to Stone after the closing. The settlement statement
recited that:: the Sutphens, received $52:.; 359. 30'at the c).. asing., In fact, :the
Sut?hens received $lO,:?5"2.47 in c~lsh'at the closing. The sett:lement
st'<!itement also reCited th;at the Stanfields paid $1.5 , 746.37 at the closing.
In fact, the Stanfields rBceiyed $24,970.14 in tash at the closing.
As of the time of closing, Stone and its agents and employees were not
avlare that the funds were hot disbursed as set out in the HUD-1 Settlement
Statement nor were they aware of the fact that Stanfield had signed a
second deed of trust on t,he house.
:',

The Committee found, however, that you believed at the titne of the
closing and preparation of the HUD-,l Settlement Statement that the buyers,'
sellers and lender fully understood the nature of the transaction and that
you did not prepare the Settlement Statement with the expectation or
intention of defrauding anyone or ,qith the intention of assisting anyone to
misrepresent the nature of the transact~on. The Committee found further
that you did not recognize at the 'time of the closing and preparation of
the HUD-l Settlement Statement that the nature of the transaction could
prove to have adverse consequences to Stone's interests.

I

By preparing and forwarding to Stone a closing statement containing
incorrect information, and by failing to othen.;rise advise Stone of the
existence of the second deed of, trust and the actual payment going to t:he
sellers prior to the closing a,nd disbur$ement of the loan proce~ds, you
failed to explain a matter sufficiently to enable St'one to make an informed
decision on going forward wit'h the loan commitment and qisbursing the Loan
proeeeds, in violation of Rule 6(B)(2), and l,lRdertook representation of a
legal matter which you k~ew or should have known you were not competent to
handle, in violation of Rule 6(A)(l).
.
, By continuing to represent Stone as closing agent and Stanfield as the
borrower a,t closing after you learned of the actual payment going to ,the ..
Sutphens and after you spould have recognize,d the pptenti'al adverse impact
on Stone, you repres.ented clients tqith adverse interests; in violation' of
Rule 5.1(B) and (C),.
Your misconduct in this situation was mitigated by the fact that, upon
becoming fully aware of the consequences artd the potential harm caused by
the incorrect recitals i~ the HUD-l Settlement Statetnent, you caused the
statement to be corrected, reported that correction to Stone, and reported

The Committee also noted in mitigation that you have limitec;l experience
in closing real estate transactions, especially HUD insured loans, and that
you did· not benefit personally by the manner in which the Settlement
Statement ,vas prepared or hO'\v the closing was handled.
The Disciplinary Hearing Commission is confident that f;:his Reprimanc!.
will be heeded by you and will ultimately prove beneficial to you. -We
trust that you will never again allow yourself to depart from $trtct
adherence to the highest standards of the legal profession.
