ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
At the hearing, the Hearing Panel received testimony from a variety of
witnesses, including judges, Defendant's former clients, an attorney, and Defendant himself.
The Hearing Panel finds that Defendant's testimony was not credible, as Defendant's testimony
was in complete conflict with the overwhelming credible evidence and testimony that was
heard by the Hearing Panel during this proceeding.
2.
Defendant's responses to State Bar grievance inquiries, filings in the DHC, and
testimony and argument during the disciplinary hearing reflect a pervasive tendency to criticize
others rather than acknowledging wrongdoing. For example:
(a) In justifying his forgery and false notary, Defendant characterized his client as
unavailable and his client's father as overbearing;
(b) In responding to the allegations of communicating directly with represented
parties, Defendant belittled opposing counsel, calling them "rude," "ugly," and
"a real jerk;"

12

(c) Defendant claimed he was not treated fairly by the judges in Western North
Carolina and was "blackballed;" and
(d) Defendant insinuated the State Bar engaged in improper conduct in litigating this
disciplinary case.
3.
Defendant acted with a selfish motive by prioritizing his own convenience over
his clients' interests and the integrity of the judicial process. This is demonstrated not only by
his chronic failure to appear in court, but also by his statement that he forged Van Hoogen's
signature and falsified the notary because he "couldn't get ahold of [Van Hoogen]" and wanted
his Van Hoogen's father to "get off [his] back."
4.
Defendant's conduct caused significant harm to his clients, who were vulnerable
because they were unfamiliar with the legal process and relied upon Defendant to protect their
rights and interests. Defendant's continual failure to diligently tend to his clients' cases
impaired his clients' ability to achieve the goals of the representation and demonstrates his
intent to act in a way that resulted in foreseeable significant harm to his clients. Defendant's
lack of dependability reflects adversely on his trustworthiness to handle clients' legal matters.
,

5.
Defendant's conduct negatively impacted his client's perception of the
profession. Mireille Rostallon testified that she feIt apprehensive of retaining an attorney for
any work as a result of her experience with Defendant.
6.
Defendant's routine failure to appear in court and tardiness for court hearings
directly interfered with the administration of justice and harmed his clients by delaying
resolution of their cases. Defendant's pattern of unexcused absenteeism occurred over a period
of at least 7 years, in multiple courts.
7.
Defendant has previously received written discipline from the Grievance
Committee of the State Bar for violating the Rules of Professional Conduct:
(a) In 1995, Defendant received a reprimand for directing an employee to sign a
client's name on a verified complaint and directing another employee to notarize
that false signature.
(b) In 1999, Defendant received a reprimand for abandoning his law practice without
notice to clients and for failing to file a client's bankruptcy petition.
(c) In 2009, Defendant received an admonition for - among other things - making
misrepresentations about missing hearings and billing a client for hearings he did
not attend.
(d) In 2009, Defendant received an admonition for failure to participate in good faith
in the State Bar's fee dispute resolution process and failure to timely respond to
notice of a grievance filed against him.

8.
These instances of prior discipline should have assisted Defendant in complying
with the Rules of Pl'ofessional Conduct, but Defendant did not reform in response to clear
directives that his behavior was improper. Instead, his pattern of client neglect, dishonesty, and
refusal to participate in the self-regulatory process continued unabated.
9.
Defendant acted in a dishonest and deceitful manner when he signed his client's
name to a verification, notarized the forged signature, and filed the verification with the Court.
This conduct reflects Defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness, and integrity, particularly
because he was previously reprimanded for nearly identical misconduct and expressly informed
that such conduct was dishonest.
10.
Defendant's conduct in forging his client's name on the verification, notarizing
the forged signature, and filing the forged and falsely notarized verification with the Court
constitute multiple criminal acts, at least one of which is a felony.
11.
Attorneys as officers of the court have a duty to avoid conduct that undermines
the integrity of the adjudieative process. When an attorney submits a forged and falsely
notarized document to the court, it causes significant harm to the profession and the
administration of justice in that-at minimum-such conduct erodes judges' and lawyers'
ability to rely on representations by a fellow attorney .
.
12.
Defendant's Willingness to communicate directly with persons he knew were
represented without the consent of their counsel had the potential to cause significant harm to
the legal profession and the administration of justice by undermining the integrity of those
individuals' attorney-client relationships.
13.
Verbally and physically aggressive behavior towards opposing counsel, such as
Defendant's behavior towards counsel for T.C., con-odes standards of professionalism among
lawyers and tends to divert the targeted lawyer's focus away from representing his or her client's
interests.
14.
Defendant's criminal conviction for violating a Domestic Violence Protective
Order reflects a disregard for the rule of law and has the potential to cause significant harm to
the standing of the legal profession in the eyes of the pUblic. When lawyers violate the law in
their business and personal affairs, it brings disrepute upon the legal profession and undermines
public confidence in lawyers.
15.
Defendant's persistent refusal to meaningfully participate in the self-regulatory
process interferes. with the State Bar's ability to regulate its members and undermines the
profession's privilege to remain self-regulating.
In addition to his repeated failure to timely respond to inquiries from the State
16.
Bar during the fee dispute and grievance processes, Defendant failed to respond to Plaintiff's
discovery requests in this disciplinary case, even when compelled by order of this Hearing
Panel. Defendant also appealed three separate orders issued by this Hearing Panel, one of

14

which stayed the proceedings in this case, but failed to perfect all three appeals, which resulted
in unnecessary delay of this proceeding. Defendant also made misrepresentations - both in his
motions and by omission - to this Hearing Panel regarding his availability for scheduled
depositions and disciplinary hearing dates. Nothing in the record tends to show that
Defendant's non-compliance with rules and orders of this tribunal was a good faith mistake or
the result of excusable neglect.
17.
In 2013, Defendant relocated to Jacksonville, NC, and began practicing law in
Onslow County. Defendant testified that he has practiced without incident in Onslow County.
However, as Defendant acknowledged at the hearing, Defendant has received two Letters of
Notice from the State Bar as a result of grievances filed against Defendant concerning his
conduct while practicing in Onslow County.
18.
There is no indication that Defendant has accepted responsibility for his
misconduct and its consequences. He has not acknowledged violating the Rules of Professional
Conduct, expressed remorse, or shown any insight regarding his lack of professionalism.
19.
Defendant, who has been licensed to practice law in North Carolina for twentytwo years, has substantial experience in the practice of law.
Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it.
2.
The Hearing Panel considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code 1B ยง .0114(w) of the Discipline and Disciplinary Rules of the North Carolina State Bar.
3.
The Hearing Panel concludes that the following factors from ยง .0114(w)(I),
which are to be considered in imposing suspension or disbarment, are present in this case:
(a) intent of the defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential harm is
foreseeable;
(b) circumstances reflecting the defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness, or
integrity;
(c) negative impact of the defendant's actions on client's or public's perception of
the profession;
(d) negative impact of the defendant's actions on the administration of justice;
(e) impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the representation;

15

(f) acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication; and

(g) multiple instances of failure to participate in the legal profession's self-regulation
process.
4.
The Hearing Panel concludes that the following factors fi'om ยง .01l4(w)(2),
which require consideration of disbarment, are present in this case:
(a) acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication; and
(b) commission of a felony.
5.
The Hearing Panel concludes that the following factors from ยง .OI14(w)(3),
which are to be considered in all cases, are present in this case:
(a) prior disciplinary offenses in this state;
(b) dishonest or selfish motive;
(c) a pattem of misconduct;
(d) multiple offenses;
(e) bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceedings by intentionally failing to
comply with the rules and orders of the disciplinary agency;
(f)

submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during
the disciplinary process;

(g) refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of conduct;
(h) vulnerability of victims; and
(i)

degree of experience in the practice oflaw.

The Hearing Panel has considered all other forms of discipline available and
concludes that any sanction less than disbarment would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of
the offenses committed by Defendant, would not adequately protect the public, and would send
the wrong message to attomeys and the public regarding the conduct expected of members of the
Bar.
6.

7.
Defendant's persistent pattern of misconduct up through and including his actions
in this disciplinary proceeding indicate that Defendant is either unwilling or unable to conform
his behavior to the requirements of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Defendant refuses to
acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct. Accordingly, if Defendant were permitted to
continue practicing law, he would pose an unacceptable risk of continued harm to clients, the
profession, the public, and the administration of justice.

16

8.
Notwithstanding repeated prior warnings about the impropriety of his conduct,
Defendant exhibits ongoing misconduct and an unrepentant attitude. Accordingly, the only way
to protect the public is for Defendant to be required to demonstrate rehabilitation and reformation
before he may be permitted to resume practicing law. Disbarred lawyers are required to prove
reformation before they may be reinstated.
9.
The Hearing Panel concludes that disbarment is the only discipline that will
adequately protect the public fi'om future transgressions by Defendant for the following reasons:
(a) The nature and extent of Defendant's misconduct;
(b) Defendant's repeated failure to participate in the State Bar's regulatory process;
(c) The nature and extent of Defendant's prior discipline; and
(d) The significant harm caused by Defendant's conduct and the significant potential
harm resulting lrom Defendant's conduct.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Findings and
Conclusions Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following
