ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

the representation; nmnely, to resolve their traffic tickets as quickly ffild easily as
possible. Defendffilt's conduct delayed her clients' abilities to achieve their goals ffild
caused ullilecessary frustration mld stress for her clients.

father's ticket. Kaasa also retained another attorney to ensure that Defendant actually
resolved the traffic ticket as stated.

Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the hem'ing pmlel also enters the following

CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the hem'ing panel has considered all of the factors
emnnerated in 27 N.CA.C. IE Â§ .01 l4(w)(3) of the Rules ffild Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar ffild finds the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a)

A pattem of misconduct; and

(b)

Multiple offenses.

8

The hearing panel has also carefully considered all of the factors
enwnerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IE Â§ .OII4(w)(l) of the Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and finds the following factors warrant suspension of Defendmlt' s
license:
?

(a)

Elevation of the Defendmlt's own interest above that of the client;

(b)

Negative impact ofDefendmlt's actions on client's or public's
perception of the profession;

(c)

Impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the
representation; and

(d)

Effect of Defendmlt' s conduct on third parties.

3.
Any sanction less thml suspension would fail to acknowledge the
seriousness of the offenses committed by Defendant, would not adequately protect the
public, and would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the
conduct expected of members of the Bar.
4.
Due to the nature mld extent ofDefendmlt's conduct and in the interest of
protecting the public this panel would consider ml active suspension of Defendmlt's
license to practice law ifit were not for Defendant's efforts to remedy the problems
caused by her representation mld her willingness to refund numerous clients' paid fees.
Accordingly, the hearing pmlel finds mld concludes that the public will be adequately
protected by suspension of Defendmlt' s license, stayed for a period of time with
conditions imposed upon Defendmlt designed to ensure protection of the public mld
continued complimlce with the Rules of Professional Conduct.
5.
Defendant has infoTIlled the hearing pmlel that she intends to apply for
inactive status with the North Carolina State Bar pursuant to 27 N.C.A.C. ID Â§ .0901.
The intent of this Order of discipline is to protect the public while Defendant is in
practice. Therefore, it would thwmi the intended effect ofthe hem'ing panel's discipline
if Defendant should be able to avoid complying with the terms of the stay of this
suspension because she is in inactive status. Furthermore, the hem'ing panel recognizes
that Defendmlt's potential transfer to inactive status cannot occur until the April 2010
