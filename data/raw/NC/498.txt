5.
Defendant's conduct can only have a negative impact on his client's and the

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of discipline
available to it.
2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
IB § .01 14(w)(l) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and detem1ines
the following factors are applicable:

(a)

Intent of the defendant to cause the resulting ham1 or potential harm;

(b)

Intent ofthe defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential harm is
foreseeable;

(c)

Circumstances reflecting the defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness,
or integrity;

(d)

Elevation of the defendant's own interest above that of the client;

(e)

Negative impact of defendant's actions on client's or public's perception
of the profession;

(f)

Negative impact of the defendant's actions on the administration of
justice;

(g)

Impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the
representation;

-9-

(h)

Effect of defendant's conduct on third parties; and

(i)

Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication.

3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
IB § .OI14(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and determines
the following factors are applicable:
(a)

Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication; and

(b)

Misappropriation or conversion of assets of any kind to which the
defendant or recipient is not entitled, whether from a client or any other
source.

4.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
lB § .OI14(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and determines
the following factors are applicable:
(a)

Dishonest or selfish motive, or the absence thereof;

(b)

Pattem of misconduct; and

(c)

Multiple offenses.

5.
Defendant caused significant harm to the Brantley fim1 and to his client Leonard
Pendleton and other clients by misappropriation oftrust funds.
6.
Defendant's repeated acts of misappropriation reflect adversely on his honesty,
trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer and caused significant potential harm to the legal
profession, in that such conduct tends to bring the legal profession into disrepute.
7.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and finds that suspension of
Defendant's license, censure, reprimand, or admonition would not be sufficient discipline,
because of the gravity of the actual and potential harm to clients, the public, and the legal
profession caused by Defendant's conduct, and the threat of significant potential harm to the
public.
8.
The Hearing Panel considered all lesser sanctions and finds that discipline short of
disbarment would not adequately protect the public for the following reasons:
a.

Defendant committed misconduct involving violations of his clients' trust.
Misconduct involving misappropriation and dishonesty is among the most serious
misconduct that an attomey can conunit. Such misconduct demonstrates that the
offending attomey is not trustworthy. Clients are entitled to have trustworthy
attomeys.

-10-

b.

Defendant repeatedly engaged in abuses oftrust by misappropriating funds
entrusted to him.

c.

Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to acknowledge the
seJiousness of the offenses Defendant committed and would send the wrong
message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct expected of members
of the Bar of this State.

d.

The protection of the public and the legal profession requires that Defendant not
be pel1nitted to resume the practice of law until he demonstrates the following:
that he has refol1ned; that he understands his obligations to his clients, the public,
and the legal profession; and that permitting him to practice law will not be
detrimental to the public or the integrity and standing of the legal profession or
the administration of justice. DisbalTed lawyers are required to make such a
showing before they may resume practicing law.

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and additional Findings of
Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel hereby enters the
following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
