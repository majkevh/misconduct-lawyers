I,

A reprimand is a written fom of discipline more serious than an
admonition issUed in cases in which an attorney has violated one or more
'provisions of the Rules of Professional COnduct and has caused hann or
" potential hann to a client, the adnlinistration of justice, the profession, or
"a member of the public;, but the misconduct does not require a censure.

I

The Grievance Committee was of the opinion that a censure is not required
, in this baSe and issues this reprimatrl to you. As chainnan of the Grievance
Committee of the North Carolina Sta,te Bar, it is now my duty to issue this
reprimand and I am certain that yqu will underStarrl fully the' spirit in which
'. this duty is perfonned.
