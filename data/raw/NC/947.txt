Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Findings of Fact
Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel also enters the following:
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fonns of
discipline available to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all ofthe f!lctors
enumemted in 27 N.C.A.C. IB Â§ .OlI4(w)(3) of the RuJes and Regulations ofthe North
Carolina State Bar and determines the following factors are applicable in this matter:
a.

Prior disciplinary offenses in this state;

b.

A pattern of misconduct;

c.

Defendant's refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct;
and

d.

Defendant has substantial experience in the practice of law.

2.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the factors enumemted
in 27 N.C.A.C. IB Â§ .OI14(w)(l) of the Rules and ReguJations of the North Carolina
State Bar and determines the following factors which wan'ant suspension of Defendant's
license are applicable to this matter:
a.

The intent ofthe Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential
h!lrm is foreseeable;

b.

The negative impact of Defendant's actions on his client's 01' the public's
perception of the legal profession;

c.

Negative impact of the Defendant's actions on the administmtion of
justice; and

-9-

N.C.A.C. 1B Â§ .01 14(w)(2) ofthe Rules and Regulations ofthe NOlth Carolina State Bar

The Hearing Panel has considered written discipline but finds that an
admonition, reprimand, 01' censure would not be sufficient disciplilw because of the harm
and potential harm to the client and the public as demonstrated by the facts in the present
case. Furthermore, the panel finds that any sanction less than a suspension would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses committed by Defendant and would send the
wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct expected of members of
the Bar in this State. The Hearing Panel finds, however, that the public will be
adequately protected by a stayed suspension under the facts and ci1-cumstances of the
present case.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Findings of Fact
Regarding Discipline, and Conclusions Regarding Discipline the Hearing Panel enters the
