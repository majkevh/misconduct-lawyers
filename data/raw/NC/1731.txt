In ~response to' your newspaper \~;(:l:yertisem~nt'.i'~isting your
charge of $450.00 for representa~~iori' in bankrupt::cy, David W. Preo
(:i?reo) consulted with you about f:il,ing bankruptcy. He etdvised
you that he did not want to file -'a, bankruptcy: Proceed:t,ng i'f doing
so would jeopardize his ex-wife'l? interest in the real property
that was their marital home. You advised him that the ,p:r::operty
wOl.llq. not be at risk, because they owned it by the entireties . .~."
you then advised Preo that your fee would be $500.00 which you
$tated was based upon the, $450.00 fee for prepar,ing' 'the docu,ments-.. _· ..
and attending the creditor'S meeting, $40.00 :as'a consultation,,":"'":'::'~\''' "
'fee, ahd $10.00 for having over ten creditors' lis,ted in the
petit,ion. Since your aq did not mention the cons,\ilta,t:i.on fe~ and,
the' extra charge for creditors in ~xcess' of ten', 'your ad was
misleading ip viola~ion of Rule 2.1(A).
'
After Preo's bankruptcy petition was filed, the trustee'
filed a motion to sell the $ntiretiesproperty to satisfy the
joint debts of P:r;eo and,his ex-wife. You erroneo:usly thought
that the trustee was seeking to sell the property because yoti had
inadequately identif,'j.ed the property as entiretie~ property in
the pet~tion. You ,filed an amendment to the petition. The
,
trustee subsequently filed a document showing that he wasseekihg
to sell the entireties property because the law allowed t,he ,
trustee to sell, entireties property to satisfy j oint debts. At
th~ hearing on the ,trustee's motion in W:i.lson; North' Carolina,
you argued that your amendment had been timely fi.led. ' You o.±d .
not understand the real issue before the court. After the judge
explained the iss~e to you offered no argument on that issue.

I

Your client subsequently borrowed money to pay the joint,
debts. Fle left $8,500.00 of that money with you which you,
deposited into' your trust account. ,The truste~ took a long time
to dete;r~ine the amount necessary to, payoff tqe joint debts., On
April 15, 1992, Preo called 'you to advise that he 'wanted to: pick
up his money held ,:in trust an<~ deal directly with tbe trustee.
,
You prepared a statement of your services charging an additional$1,245.00, mostly for services relating to the trustee's motion.
Preo did riot receive, any benefit from these ser\riqes since you
had not understood Or given advice'on the real issue before tl}e
court. Preo subsequently sought a refund of the fees charged,' f:or
services for which he received no benefit. YO'\.,l refused to.' g,ive
him a refund. This refusal to refund fees charged for services
for which the client; Preo; did not benefit violated Rule
2.8 (A) (3) .
You 'are hereby'reprimanded by the North Carolina State Bar
due to your professional misconduct. The Grievance Committee
trusts that you will 'heed this reprimand, that itw:i.ll be
remembered by you, that it wi],l 'be beneficial to YO'l:l"and tnat .
you will never again allow yourself to depart from adherence to
the high ethica'I standards of the ;Legal profession .
