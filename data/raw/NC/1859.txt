AMENDED FINDINGS OF FACT

)

AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

)

A. STANLEY MITCHELL, Attorney )
)

Defendant.

)

THIS CAUSE came on to be heard and was originally heard on
July 15, 1994, before a hearing committee composed of Frank E.
Emory, Jr., Chair; Richard L. Doughton and Frank L. Boushee. At
that hearing, A. Root Edmonson represented the North Carolina State
Bar and the Defendant, A. Stanley Mitchell, appeared pro~. :eased
upon the admissions of the Defendant due to his default for failure
to file an Ari~wer or otherwise plead in this matter after having
been served with the Complaint, and after hearing from and
considering the evidence offered on behalf of the State Bar and
hearing from the Def~hdant, the hearing committee entered Findings
of Fact, Conclusions of Law and entered an Order o'f Discipline
disbarring th;e Defendant.

1

i

On Augus't 9, 1994, the Defendant filed a Motion pursuant to
Rule 60 6f the Nortb Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure in which he
requested a new hearing based upon the facts set forth in that
motion. .An Order was entered by the Chair granting a new hearing.
The rehearing of this matter commenced on January 18, 1995,
with the same' Panel wh:i,.ch had been convened previously and is set
forth above.A. Root Edmonson again represented the North Carolina
State Bar and ',James B. Maxwell appeared on behalf of the Defendant.
It was not po~sible to conclude the rehearing on that date, and it
was adjourned until January 30, 1995, with the consent of all
parties.
t

O~ January 30, 1995, and at the conclusion of the hearing, the
Panel announced its decision which included the conclusion that the
Order of Disc~pline should not be changed from the ~uly 15, 1994,
decision. Thereafter, on its own consideration and upon a motion
filed on behalf of the Defendant to amend the decision of the Panel
and after further consideration, the Panel decided to amend some
of its prior f;indings of :l;act, concluSions of law and the ultimate
Order of Discipline in this matter, and now believes that the
following findings of fact and conclusions are supported by clear,
cogent and convincing evidence.

FINDINGS OF FACT
1.
The Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar, is a body
duly organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the p+oper
party to bring this proceeding under th,e authority granted it in .
Chapter 84 ·of the General Statutes of North Carolina, and the Rules
an¢! Regulations 0; th~ North Carolina State Bar 'promulgated
thereunder.
2.
The Defendant, A. Stanley Mitchell (hereinafter Mit~hell)
was admitted to the North Carolina State Bar Qn August 19, 1989, .
and ~s, and was at all times referred to h~rein, an Attorney at Law
licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to' the rules,
regl,llations, . and Rules of Professional Conduct of the Nortih
Carolina State Bar and the laws of the State of No~th CarQlina.
3.
During all of the periods referred to he;rein; Mitchell
was actively engaged in the practice of law in the state of Nor~h
Carolina and maintained a law office in the City of Winsto~-Salem,
Forsyth COl,lnty, North Carolina.
.
4.
For a relatively short period of time after he b~gan'
practicing law, Stanley Mitchell was associated with Greg Davis,
an attorney at law practicing in Forsyth County.
D\1ring thilt
period of time, M;r. Davis and his office staff were responsible for
ha~dling all funds in connection with the operation of the office,
including client funds and the t:r:ust account. Mr. Mitchell neither
had any exposure to nor training in the maintenance of such t~ust
acco\1nts or balancing of books or the maintenance of ledger cards .
on each client.

5.
Beginning in approximately late 1990, or ea:J;'ly 1991, and'
because Mr. Davis became a Public Defenc;ier for Fo;rsyth County, ~r.
Mitchell began his practice as a sole practitioner. At that time,
he opened a trust account at Branch Banking &: Trust Company
(hereinafter, BB&:T) I Account No. 1911021745 (hereinafter BB&:T Tr.u$·t
Account). He did not maintain nor c:::reate clie~t ledg~r caJ:!ds f.or·
e~the;r his trust account or his operating account, nor did he. or
any member of his staff attempt to reconcile bank statements ~t tll.e·
end of each month for each client.
His office did balance the,ir
respective accpunts each month to determine that they were acqurate,
in the amount of funds they wer~ showing in the t;rust account, b~t
they did not credit that amount to individual clients or to M;r.
Mitchell. Generally, Mr. Mitchell and his secretary attempted to
keep an account for their clients lIin their heads ll each and every
month, based upon their best recollection of the amounts that had
been deposited in the trust acco~t on behalf of clients.
6.
During law school, Stanley Mitchell had receiveQ. ..no
instructions on trust account or its proper maintenance, nor at I11ny
CLE program that he attended, and since he did not learn from Greg
Davis about the appropriate handling of trust .accounts, he was'

generally unfamiliar with how to maintain such accounts.
It was
his general opinion that so long as the trust account "balanced"
each month a,nd as long as he and his secretary had an idea of
(thought they knew) how much was in the account on behalf of ~ach
client, that~would be sufficient, particularly if there were funds
of Mitchell's in the trust account so there would be a "surplus"
to protect clients.
7.
From time to time; Mitchell would deposit funds of his
own :i,.n his trust account or allow fees that had been earned to
remain in that account after the ca,se was closed.
It was his
belief that in so doing he could ensure that the trust account
checks would never "bounce" or be returned for insufficient funds.
Because neither he nor his secretary did a client per client
crediting of, the trust account at the end of each month, Mr.
Mi~chell was never aware of how much, if any, of his fun~s might
have been in the trust account. He believed that there were always
funds in some amount that represented fees that he had not yet
transferred o'r monies of his own he had deposited directly into the
trust account. He did not appreciate nor understand that ,this was
a commingling of fundS.

I

8.
Som,etime in late 1991 or the early part of 1992,
Mitchell became interested in expanding his busines~ interests to
include the purchase, fix-up, rent and/or ultimate sale of property
in and around Forsyth County. More often than not, the property
he was interested in acquiring was at foreclosure sale.
He
discussed this wi th his wife and several friends and over an
approximate],.2
18 month period of time would, on behalf of
himself and/dr his wife and friends, make investments, on his or
their behalf,. in various pieces of real estate in this manner.
9.
In ,late December, 1991, Mitchell learned of a piece of
real estate located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, at' 3010
Apollo Drive which was in foreclosure. He discussed that with his
wife and two other in~ividuals who ultimately agreed to become
investors in purchasing this property. In order to acquire this;
an upset bid' would need to be made in the office of Clerk of
Superior Cour~ of Forsyth County and the only method of doing that
would be by cash or cashier's check. It was Mitchell's intention
that the investo~s, including his wife, would put up $1,100 fQr
this purpose and that from that fund he would be able to put up a
cash "upset bid'i on their behalf.
10. On December 30, 1991, Mitchell took a personal check or
business chec~ to BB&;'i' and gave it to the bank in' return for a
cashier's check made payable to the Forsyth County Clerk of
Superior Court;.. The amount of the p~rsonal or business check given
to BB&T by Mitchell was $1,080 and that was the amount of the
cashier's chepk directed to the Clerk of Superior Court.
This
transaction d~d not involve his trust aQcottnt in any manner.

11. On December 31, 1991, Mitchell deposited an adq,:Ltional
check in the amount of $1,100 into his trust account at BB&:T on
behalf of the investor group which was intended to be used' ;for
additional e~p~nses in connection with the purch,ase at foreclosure
of the Apollo Drive property.
12. The persohal or business check that Mitchell' had given
to BB&:T to purchase the cashier's check was later returned f.or
insufficient funds.
At that time t;he on+y account that Mitchell
had with B~&:T was his trust account[ and thus, BB&:T ~a4e a charge
against the trust account as the only account it had acce~s to in
order to satisfy the dishonored personal check of Mitche'll.
Coincidentally, and because Mitchell had deposit,d a oheolt for
$1,1.00 in the t~ust account for the investors sub~equent to the
P'llrchase of the $1,080 cashier's check, no other funds in t;he trus,t
account were initially affected.

I

13. On J~nuary 6,1992, the $,1,100 i.tem ofdE!posit wh,icl:!.ll~d
been made into Mitchell's t+ust account on behalf of the investors
was also returned uncollected and the trust ~ccoupt wa~ debited in
tha t amount.
14. Mitchell's sf;tcretary, Pam Holland,adviseq, him that the
deposit of $1,100 that had been made into the trust account was
returned for insufficient funds and that the BB&:T trust account had
been so debited.
Mi tchell did not replace the debi ted item wi.th
othe~ funds and as a result of that action, the $1,080 charge back
that had been levied against his trust account from his origi~~l
$1,080 check was covered, by necessity, by other funds of cli~nts
held in the trust account or with funds of his own which had been
commingled.
15. in October, 1991, Mitchell w~s employed by Bishop J,.D.
Johnson to file a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorg~nization for Gospel
M~dia, inc.
'
,
16. Approximately $3,100 was deliv~red to Mitche1i o~ b~ha1f
of Gospel Media, ,inc. to be held in trust as filing fees, expenseE,J',
and an advanced payment of Mitchell's fees.
That money wa's
deposited into Mitchell's trust account at,BB&:T.

I

17. Over a period Qf time, Mi,tche11 removed a total of $2,600
wh;ch represented the payment of his fees ;from the trust account
,and deposited that sum into his offioe account.
18. After all of the fee Mitchell had been paid ;n advanc~.
had been removed from the BB&:T trust; accoupt, Bishop John~on pec~e
dissatisfied with the progress of the Gospel'Media, inc. matter and'
retained new counsel.
Bishop Johnson reqliested a refund of the
entire fee previously paid to Mitchell.

19. Although contending that he had done considerable work
for Gospel Media, Inc., Mitchell agreed to refund the fee.
20. On. March 19, 199.2, Mitchell deposited $2;600 into his
BB&T trust account from his office account.
21. By'check'#1255 on his BB&T trust account, Mitchell paid
the $2,600 refund to the new attorney for Gospel Media, Inc ••
Check #1255 Qleared the BB&T trust ac~ount on March 25, 1992.
22. On March 25, 1992, Mitchell's BB&T trust account was
debited $2,690 because the check Mitchell had deposited into the
tru~t account was returned ior insufficient funds.
23 • Mi tchell did not replace the $2, 600 debi ted from .the B~&T
trust account due to. his office account check being returned for
insufficient funds • This caused funds which he held in a fiduciary
capacity for other clients to be used to cover the $2,600 debit,
or individual comminglec:i funds of his to be so used.

I

24. On July 8, 1992, Mitchell opened a new trust account at
Mechanics anc:i Farmers Bank in Winston-Salem, NC, Account No.
4150009282 (hereinafter M&F trust account).
He also had at that
time his o~fice operating account at Mechanics and Farmers Bank,
Account No. 415007907.
25. In April, 1992, Mitchell undertook to represent Lawson
Banks Graves (hereinafter Graves) in an attempt to reopen a Chapter
13 bankruptcy case that had been dismissed by the bankruptcy court
in March, 199~.
26. On or about July 8, 1992, Graves delivered $5,000 to
Mitchell to be used for expenses and payments Graves would be
responsible fbr making to the Chapter 13 office.
,27. Mitchell, or his office staff, erroneously deposited the'
$5,000 received from Graves into his office account at M&F, Account
#415007907, i~stead of the newly opened trust account. Over time,
Mitchell used those funds which had been deposited into his office
account to pay office expenses or for his own benefit.
28. Mitchell subsequently made disbursements from his M&F
trust account on behalf of Graves in the total sum of $4,530.
Since no fund~ were on deposit for Graves in the M&F trust account,
funds which he held in a fiduciary capacity for other clients, or
his personal commingled fundS, were USed to pay the Graves trust
account disbursements.
.
29. Because there were at that time no ledger cards kept for
clients, Mitchell was unaware that he had used other client funds
for the Graves' purposes since he had erroneously believed that the
$5,000 had initially been put into the trust account, as did his

secretary, and thus when they would ,make "drawt3" againsttl',ie
"Graves trust account funds", they believed such fund,s wer~ there.
30. In September 1992, Mitchell became interef;1ted in
purchasing another piece of property as an investment.
';J:'he
property was to be purchased from a Margaret Spe~ce and was known
as 2401 Patterso~ Avenue. Mitchell spoke with his wi~e about t~is
transaction and believed that his wife was goi~g tQ prov:i;d,e at
least $5,000 toward the purchase of that property.

I

31. Based upon h~s belief that his wife would provide th~
$5,000 necessary to purchase the Patterson Avenue prope~ty from
Spence and knowing that he would put that into the trust a'ccount
as he had previously done, on September 18,1992, Mitchell,wr.ote
check #123 from his M&F tru~t account payable to Ms. Spence, t~e
sum of $3,500 for the purchase of the property. Jofitchell's wife
later changed her mind and refused to give' him money' fot' the
purchase of Patterson Avenue property, and thus, there was no
deposit made into the trust account to cover the check thatha~
been previously issued on September 18, 1992, to Ms. Spence.
32. At all times relevant to this proceeding, the Defenda:p.t' s
wife, Carol Mitchell, was employed at RJR Nabisco and had a capi.tal .
investment account with that company in addition to other ~eparat$
assets and savings that would have been more than sufficient to
have covered all transactions described above, had, demand ever bee;p,
made to reconcile an account.
33. On September 21, 1992, Mitchell wrote check #124 froll),hilSl
M:&F tr~st account payable tQ him!=lelf in the sumof$i,50Q, ;in th.e
apparent belief that he had fees earned but not yet taken
suf'ficient to cover that amount in that account.
34. On Octobe;r 16, 1992, Mitchell wrote another check, #153, .
from his M&F trust account payable to Margaret Spence in the sum
of $200.

I

'35. At the time check #153 was written, there were no fun4s
on deposit for MargCl,ret Spence on behalf of investors forMeh
Spence's property in Mitchell's ~&F trust account. The check was
paid from funds which he held in a fiduciary capacity for liis
clients, or personal 'commingled funds.
36. On October 20, 1992, M~tchell deposited $18,685 i~ lQan
proceeds from a personal loan to his M&F trust account as the f~rt3t .
deposit rela'ting to the property at ~401 Patterson Avenue. Tliese
funds would remain in the account as personal and/or commingled
funds for an indefinite period of time.
.
37. Mitchell represented Arthur L. and Mart-haB. par~mt; in
a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition •. In court on November 12,:J,.9,9·2,

the Parents.
The Parents entrusted $4,000 to Mitchell for that
purpose. Mitchell deposited the Parents' $4,000 to his M&F trust
account. That deposit was credited to the account on November 13,
1992.
38. On :November27, 1992, Mitchell directed M&F to transfer
$1,400 from his M&F trust account to his office account. The bank
prepared a d,ebit memo as a record of this transaction.
This
withdrawal f~om the M&F trust acco~t was not attributed to a~y
client by Mitchell on his copy of the debit memo, but was covered
by the personal loan funds commingled by Mitchell in his trust
account.
39.

On ,November 27, 1992, Mitchell also directed M&F to
anot:her $+,000 from his M&F trust account to his office
account.
The bank prepared a debit memo as a record of this
transaction. ' This withdrawal from the M&F trust account was not
attributed to: any client by Mitchell on his copy of the debit memo,
but was covered by the personal loan funds commingled by Mitchell
in his tru~t ~ccount.

40. On November 30, 1992, Mitchell directed M&F to transfer
another $2,000 from his M&F trust account to his office account.
The bank prepared a debit memo as a record of this transaction.
This withdrawal from the M&F trust account was not attributed to
any client by Mitchell o~ his copy of the debit memo, but was
covered by the personal loan funds commingled by Mitchell in his
trust account.
41. Mitchell did not send a check to FHA on behalf of the
. ,
."
Parents until !December 4, 1992.
Ml.tchell's
M&F trust account check
made payable ~o FHA in the sum of $4,000 was returned because there
were insuffic~ent fundS on deposit in Mitchell's account to pay the
check.
In all transactions described above, this was the only
known instance in which a trust account check of Mitchell's (either
from the BB&Tor M&F trust account) had been dishonored.
42 . Mitchell promptly made the FHA payment from personal
funds after notification of the return of that check.
,

43. Lik~ his BB&T trust account, Mitchell fa.iled to keep
ledger ca.rds ,for ihdiv:l.dual accounts showing trust account or
office account cards for each client so that could be reconciled
or so that he would know the amounts that were actually on deposit
for any client at any given time. He or his office. continued to
simply IIbalanqe ll the account with the bank statement each month.
44. During the North Carolina State Bar's investigation of
matter, David Frederick and a deputy counsel from the State
Bar met with Mitchell in Mitchell's office in Winston-Salem, NC on
September 28, :i993. At that meeting, Mitchell was asked to provide

48. )Jitchell never did provide the Statt;! Bar wit;h the
documents necessary for the State Bar's investigation of this
matter.
49. When·the irregularities of the trust account became kno~
to the State Bar, the trust accounts w.ere frozen. Sinc;t;! that ti:me.,
Mitchell has continued his practice of l~w and haSi not u,sed any
trust account (he did not attempt t.o open a new one),' but ratht;!r,
has had his clients deal only in cash and/or cashier's checks and
while cumbersome, this has worked sufficiently.
There have been
no apparent additional comminglings and/or problems wit~ the trust
account.

50. With the exception of the $4,000 check made payabl~to
the FHA on behalf of the Parents, it does not appear that any other
check from either trust account (BB&T or M&F) was ever ret~rned for
insufficient funds.
51, At nQ time has any client of Mr. Mitchell's ever as~ed
for funds which had been deposited with him which were not returned
to them in a prompt manner.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.
At: the rehearing of this matter, the burden was on the
Defendant to prove that any findings of fact or oonclusions of law
previously found by this hearing committee which had been based
Upon the Defendant's default should be changed or modified.
2.
Th~
Defendant has satisfied the Committee at the
rehearing that his actions were not such as to constitute a
violation of Rule 1.2(B) Or 1.2(C).
3.
While the Defendant has offered a fuller explanation of
what transpired, some docutnent'ation as tp the financial stability
of his wife throughout all times in which issues were involved and
has provided ,additional character testimony on his behalf, he has
failed to carry his burden to establish that all of the findings
of fact or conclusions previously found by the hearing committee
were erroneo.q.s. The Committee does believe his actions in regard
to the manag,ement of his trust account wer'e never intended to
"embezzle" or divert ·funds to his own use, although this may have
been the ult1mate unintended effect of ~ome of his actions.
