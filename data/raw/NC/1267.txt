j·udgment creditor being the sante in both Qases -:ao~~ Indemnity

11. Following the surrender of hi~ license in 'April 1972,
Applicant maintained an office and a telephone in tpe' bffices :
of an a.t-torney (Rp. 44 and 45). Later, Applicant. obtained at).
office of his own (Rp. 44). In no case d.id Applic;:ant indicate
to the public that he was practicing law as an attor'ney (Rp.
29-31 and 47-51). From April 1972 until the date of the hea~­
ing, Applicant.engaged in the business of preparing title abstraqts for other attorneys for whiqn he received pay (Rp. 23).
He dio not render legal opinions as such although he I;epo+teq

real estate which he abstracted (Rp. 51). In short, App~icant

estate titles for other attorneys. Applicant's gross incoI1\e
from this, occupation in 1976 was $18,000.00 or $1.9,000.00 (Rp.'

3 • The Hear ing Committee fee Is" however, that I due, to the
age of Applicant, if he is ever to have his license reinstated,
it should be reinsta~ecl at a time when it will be of some use
,to him rather than to delay reinstatement until the unpaid jtidgments are paid which :will, without question, require a number, of
years.
He has, throughco~endaple E;ffort, rehabilitated himself to a marked degree and l1as gained the respect c;>fthe people
in his communi.ty for his exemplary conduct in difficuit circUmstanc,es" ev.en t.houghthe circumstances were the result: of his
own a,ct ions.

4. The Hea'ring'~ :Committee believes that Applicant has sustained the burden of demc;mstrating by clear and convincing evidence that: he has the mora,l qualifications, competency, and learning ~n the law required for ad~ission tc;> practice in this state
and tha,t the resumpt:i;.on of the pract'ic'e of law witl;lin the State
by petitione'r will b~ neither detrimental to the integrity and
standing of the bar qJ;' the adm~inistration of justice nor subversive
of t-he public interest.

Based on the fOJte~going Findings and Conclusions,
COffiIJ\ittee makes the :eollowing:
