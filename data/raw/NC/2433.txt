THIS MATTER was heard by the Chairman of the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission of the North Carolina State Bar, Richard T. Gammon, pursuant to 27
NCAC 1B § .0117 (d) of the State Bar Discipline and Disability Rules upon the
atfidavit""oj ~.ger of surrender of license ,executed .by Robin N. Kni~
Janua~, 2005, and filed in the offices of the State Bar on January..af, 2005.
Based on the affidavit, the Chairman finds that:

I

(a) In May 2003, Robin N. Knight ("Knight") was the closing attorney for
her clienfs real estate loan re-financing transaction and received
$124;091 in her trust account to payoff her client's prior mortgage
loan. Knight failed to payoff that loan and allowed her trust account
balance to drop to $121,724.10 when she Closed that trust account in
July 2003. Knight did not deposit any- of the $121,724.10 in another
trust account Instead, Knight misappropriated the money and
deposited it into her business operating account, payroll account and
personal bank account. The money deposited in her operating and
payroll accounts was used to pay her business expenses, and the
money deposited in her personal account WaS used to pay her
personal expenses. When the State Bar obtained an injunction in
November 2003, Knight did not have sufficient funds in all of her bank
accounts combined to payoff the $12:4,091 loan. .
(b) In June 2003, Knight was the closing attorney in a real estate
transaction and received $162,946 in her trust account that was to pe
used to payoff a construction loan at closing. Knight failed to payoff ..
the construction loan l!ntil August of 2003 after the State Bar initiated
an investigation. Between the date of receipt of the loan proceeds in
May 2003 and the date of disbursem~nt of .the construction loan in

I

/51

August 2003, Knight did not maintain a sufficient balance in her trust
account at all times to, account for the $162,946 in undisbursed loan
proceeds from thi.s transaction.
(c) In May alid June 2003, Knight misappropriated other client funds and
used these entrusted funds that she received on behalf of clients and
third parties for my own benefit or for the benefit of someone other
than the legal or beneficial owner of the funds.
This conduct constitutes grounds for discipline, under N.C. Gen. Stat. §
84-28 (b)(2), in that Knight violated Rules 1.15-2 (a), 0) & (m) and 8.4 (b) & (c) of
