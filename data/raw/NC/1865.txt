STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA
CQUNT~

OF WAKE

BEFORE THE
GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE
OF THE
NORTH CAROLINA STATE B~
94G083.5 (II)

IN THE MATTER OF
W. DAVID SMITa, JR.,
ATTORNEY AT LAW

I

CENSURE

On January 12, 1995 f the Grievance Committee of the North
Carolina State Bar met and considered the grievance filed against
you ~y Emma Purcell.
Pursuant to section 13 (A) of article IX of the Rules and
Regulations of the North Carolina State B~r, the Grievance
Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the
information available to it, including your response to the
letter of notice, the Grievance Committee found probable caus~.
P::ro'bable cause is defined in the rul~s as "reasonable cause to
believe that a member of the North Carolina State Bar is guilty
of misconduct justifying disciplinary action."
'
The rules provide that atter a finding of probable cause,
the Grievance Committee may determine that the filing of a
compla;Lnt and a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission are not required and th~ Grievance Committee may issue
various levels of discipline depending upon the misconduct, .the
actual or potential injury caused, and any aggravating or
mitigating fac,tors. The Grievance Committee may issue an
admonition, ::reprimand, or a censure.

I

A censure is a written form of discipline more serious 'than
a r~primand, issueQ. in ca,ses in which an attorney has violated
one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct and
has caused significant harm or potential significant harm to a
cli~nt, the administration of justice, the profession or a member
of the public, but the misconduct does not require suspension of
the attorney's license.
The Grievance Committee believes that a hearing before the
Disciplinary Hearing Commission is pot required in this case and
issues this censure to you, As chairman of the Grievance
Committee of the North Carolina State Bar, it is now my duty to
issue this censure. I am certain that you will undeJ;stand fully
the spirit in which this duty is .performed.
In 1991, you und~rtook to handle a workers' compensation
claim for Emma Purcell. On Feb. 25; 1993, Ms. Purcell filed a

grievan~e

against you with the 12th Judicial District Grievance.
She contended that you had neglected her workers' compensation
claim.

You werecontac;ted by the 12th Judicial District Grievance
Committee and asked to respond to Ms. PUrcell's grievance by
April 15, 1993;. You did not respond to the Committee until Dec.
2, 1993, when ,you sent an answer to Richard T. Craveh, the
irtvestigating Imember, by facsimile transmission. The letter
which you sent to Mr. Craven was dated May 5, 1993, thereby
falsely suggesting that you had responded earlier when you had
not.
On JUly 2,8, 1994, counsel for the N. C. State Bar requested
you to send a copy of Ms. PUrcell's entire file.
You did not
respond to the July 28, 1994 letter or to counsel's follow up
letter of Sept. 6, 1994 which again requested a copy of Ms.
PUrcell's file.
On Sept. 16, 1994, the State Bar issued a
subpoena to you, comm~nding you to appear and produce Ms.
Purcell's file, on Oct. 10, 1994.

I

Prior to Oct. 10, you telephoned bar counsel and represented
that yo~ had already mailed the file.
This statement was false.
Bar counsel agreed to release you from the subpoena, at your
request, and upon your specific promise to send copies of the
file again by overnight mail. You did not send the file,
however, nor did you appear in response to the subpoena.
On Oct. 14, 1994 bar counsel again wrote to you, indicating
that the Purcell file had not been received and that a new
subpoena would be issued to you. You did not respond to the Oct.
14 letter. and did not send t~e Purcell file.
Consequently, a
second subpoena was issued on Oct. 24, 1994, commanding you to
appear in Raleigh with Ms. Purcell's file on Nov. 21, 1994. You
did not comply with the subpoena nor did you obtain any order
releasing you :j:.rom its requirements. You did ultimately produce
the file on Nov. 23, 1994.
By failing to respond promptly to the local grievance
committee and bar counsel's letters of July 28 and Sept. 6, 1994
and by failing to produce the Purcell file as you promised in
exchange for a'release from the Oct. 10 subpoena, you failed to
respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary
authority in v~olation of Rule 1.1(B). By failing to comply with
the subpoena commanding you to appear before the State Bar on
Nov. 21; 1994 you engaged in conduct which constituted contempt
of the N.C. State Bar in violation of G.S. 84-28(b) (3) and also
failt?d to respoIid to a lawful demand for information of a
disciplinary a4thority in violation of Rule 1.1(A). By falsely
representing that you had responded to the local committee
regarding Ms. Purcell's grievance in May 1993 and by falsely
representing that you mailed Ms. PUrcell's file to the State Bar
on Sept. 16, 1994 yo~ engaged in dishonest conduct in violation
of Rule 1.2(C) of the Rules of Professional Conduct and knowingly
