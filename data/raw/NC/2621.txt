I

Z. Hinnant voluntarily ceased practicing law on March 17, 2006 and
promptly sought counseling. Hinnant's bipolar disorder was discovered as a
result of this counseling arid he has followed his physician's treatment
r~commendations since the di$order was diagnosed. Hinnant's bipolar disorder
likely contribLJted to his misconduct.
.
3. At the time of the misconduct, Hinn~nt was also experiencing a great
amount of stress and anxiety stemming frOm severely strained relationships .
within his immediate family. .
. '

I

.

.

4. Hinnant's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
a. substantial experience in the practice of laW'; and
b. multiple offenses,
5, Hinnant's misconduct is mitigated by the following factors:

a.

absence of a prior disciplinary record;

b. personal and emotional probiems;
c. good faith efforts to rectify the consequences of his conquct by
testifying truthfully and voluntarily at a hearing seeking to set aside the judgment.
against his clients;

d. full and free disclosure to the hearing committee and
cooperative attitude toward these proceedings;
e. good character or reputation;

I

f. remorse; and
g . lack of evidence that this conduct was anything other than an
isolated incident.
'
.
6. The mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating factors,
7. Defendant's conduct harmed his c1.ients in that Algamene was
unsuccessful in its attempts to set aside the judgment against it entered asa
result of Defendant's actions.
.
8. Defendant's conduct also has the potential to cause significant harm to
the standing of the legal profession in th~ eyes of the public because it shoWs' .
qisdain for his obligations as an attorney and officer of the court to be truthfLJI.at
all times. SLlch erosion of public confidence in attorneys tends to sully the

reputatipn of, and fosters tH~re~pect for, the profes$ion as a whole. Confidence
in the legal profession is a building blqck for public trust in the entire legal
system.

9.

The Hearing Committee has carefully considered all of the different
forms of discipline available to it and finds that any of the sanctions less than
susp~ri~ion would fail to ackhowle(:ige the seriousness of the offenses committed
by Def~nd.qnt and would send the wrong mess~ge to attorneys and the public
regarcUng the conduct expected of members of the ear. For the nature of
Defendant's deceitful condUG.t ~no the protection of the public this com.mittee
would consiq~r an .active suspension of D~fendant's license to practice I~w if it
were not for th~ evidence of Defendant's subsequent efforts to rectify the
consequences of his actions, his undiagnosed mental health issues and his
prQrliP~ and continued medicall;lnd psychological treatment, and'consideration of
the apparent isolated incidence of his conduct. Given those circumstances, the
Hearing Committee finds and Conc\l;ldes that the public will be adequately
prot~cted by suspension of Defendant's license,· stayed for a period of time with
COrlditjQns imposed upon Def~mdant designed to ensure protection of the public
and Defendant's continu~d compliance with the Revised Rules of Professional
Cpnguct.

the Hearing Committee enters the following
