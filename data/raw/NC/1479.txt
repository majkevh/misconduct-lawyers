in this matt'er was unprofessional and in
Nor,th Carolina Code· of Professional
It brought discredit upon you and tended to
·and the Bar in di,srepute.

As an experienc~d trial lawyer, you should know that a
lawYer who undertakes to represent an in~i v;f.:dufll a,ccus'ed o:f
serious crimes -accept·s a tremendous, professional. resp~i1si1:;lili ty •
Only by diligent anq 'thorough ef~ort can a crim~na,l defen$e
lawyer provide the sort of representation re-qUir,ed to insllre
that the presumption of innocence and other important
cons1d,.tutional guara;nteesa.re fully observed. At a minimum, the
:fulfillment of ,this :responsibi:lity requ'ires the lawyer to have
personal communication with his 'client.
The rea~onsthat personal communication is necessary between
lawyer ~nd client in serious criminal cases woqld be '
self-evId'ent. Pe~sdna,l cP'Quni.~,atipn is necessa'ry for the
J.a:wer :to :b.E! 'ab.le >t~.~,deqUate'iy ,exp'lain to the client all of the
'Qj..i;el'lt# s 1:'ights;- ,o.nly in the context .of a P~.:!:,$,¢na;I. interview

llPPD 'su,chque'stion!3 las how :the ,eij,.ent should ,pie'ad and whether
the client should talke the wit~ess stand. The lawyer who fails
to engage his client in a meaningful dialogue on the~e subjects
jeopqrdizes hi$client's right to adequate representation.
Likewise, personal c'ommunication is neceSSary to guide the,
attorney in his 'investigation of the cas~ an& to enable the
client t~ assist in the preparation of the defense.

The necessity for persona'l communication in. cases of this
sort is inc;eas$f:i when th,e c.li$.n't i.s re~~t.j;veJ,y UnS9Phi.sticated

:'l!hese feelings can only be al;layed 'by manifestations of the
laWyer,' s personal in1:erest ,in the case. Certainly it is
unreasonable to expect that a relationship which is depen(lent.
for its ,success upon, trust can be fostered in the absence of
personal communicati9h.,
