ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE

I

1. In December 2002 and in December 2003, Reynolds was disciplined by the
, Guilford County Superior Court. The misconduct for which Reynolds was disciplined
occurre<;l in approximately the saple period as the matters cited ip the State Bar's
complaint herein. Consequently, the Committee did not consider the orders to constitute
prior c.liscipline that should be considered in aggravation of Reynolds' misconduct.
~. Reynolds' conduct is aggravated by the following facts:

a) He engaged in a patternÂ· of misconduct.

If>) He engaged in multiple violations of the Rules of Professional
Conduct.

9,

I

c) He has substantial expenence in the practice of law.

d) He faileU to acknowledge wrongdoing.
e) Some of his misconduct involved misleading statements to coUrts.
3. The Hearing Committee found the following mitigating fact:

I

a) Reynolds' misconduct was not motivated by a selfish motive.

4. The aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors.
Based on the foregoing findings of fact, the Committee enters the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW RELEVANT TO DISCIPLINE
L Reynolds' ;misconduct caused actual harm and created a threat of significant
potential harm: to his clients.
2. Reynolds' misconduct harmed the administration. of justice in that the feder(li
court had to devote substantial resources to reviewing cases in which Reynolds failed to
follow the court's local rules or the Rules of Professional Cond1,lct and hi holding show
cause and disciplinary hearings.
3. A substantial period of suspension is the only
protect the pu"blic for the following reasons:

sanctio~

that can adequately

a) Reytlolds' misconduct occurred over a substantial period of time and therefore
appears to be the result of a serious condition Â·or character flaw, rather than an
aberration.

I

b) An order of di~cipline less than a five year suspension would not sufficiently
protect the public because Reynolds has failed to show that he has adclressed .
whatever trait or problem that caused his misconduct and therefore there is a risk
that he woul4 continue to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct if he were
allowed to continue ~he practice of law.
c) Entry of an order imposing lesser discipline would fail to acknowledge the
seriousness of the offenses that Reynolds committed and would send the wrong
message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct expected of members
ofthe Bar in North Carolina.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Findings of
Fact Regarding Discipline, and any mixed findings of fact and conclusions of law
howsoever designated, the Hearing Committee hereby enters the follC?wing:
