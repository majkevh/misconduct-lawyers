'Originally, the seller had agreed to a $7,400 loan to the buyer,
but at closing, the buyer was still $2,000 short of the funds
needed for his down payment.
During the closing, the seller
agreed to loan the buyer an additional $2,000, for a total loan
amount of $9,400, and instructed Defendant to draft a promissory
note.
However, Defendant continued to list the amount as $7,400
on the HUD-l statement she prepared.
At the DHC hearing,
Defendant acknowledged this error,
which she asserts was
unintentional and merely clerical.
The error in the amount of
this loan was not part of any allegations by the State Bar
against Defendant.

THE NORTH CAROLINA STATE BAR,
Plaintiff
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
v.

SYBIL H. BARRETT, Attorney,
Defendant
This matter was heard on 3 February 2011 before a hearing panel of the
Disciplinary Hearing Commission composed of C. Colon Willoughby, Jr., Chair, Ronald
R. Davis and Patti Head. Leanor Bailey Hodge represented Plaintiff, the North Carolina
State Bar. Defendant, Sybil H. BalTett, appeared pro se.
Based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, the Hearing Panel makes by
clear, cogent and convincing evidence the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT
I. Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar (hereinafter "State Bar"), is a body duly
organized under the laws of NOlih Carolina and is the proper party to bring this
proceeding under the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North
Carolina, and the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar promulgated thereunder.

2. Defendant, Sybil H. Barrett (hereinafter "Defendant"), was admitted to the
State Bar on 22 March 2003 and is, and was at all times referred to herein, an Attorney at
Law licensed to practice in NOlih Carolina, subject to the rules, regulations, and Rules of
Professional Conduct of the State Bar and the laws of the United States and the State of
North Carolina.
3. During the times relevant herein, Defendant actively engaged in the practice of
law in the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office in Chm'lotte, Mecklenburg
County, North Cm·olina.
4. On 17 .July 2007 Defendant represented the buyer, Earl Holmes, Jr., and the
lender, Chase Bank (now JP Morgml Chase Bank), at the closing of the sale of property
located at 11928 Little Stoney Court in Chm'lotte, North Cm-olina ("Holmes-Crowley
Closing").

5. jp Morgan Chase was a federally insured lender in 2007 at the time that
Defendant represented JP Morgan Chase at the Holmes-Crowley closing.
6. Defendant sent documents for the Holmes-Crowley closing to the seller and
the lender by U.S. mail and facsimile.
7. According to the lender's closing instructions to Defendant, the lender agreed
to loan the buyer 85% of the purchase price and required the buyer to personally provide
at closing $22,200.00 in cash as a down payment toward the $148,000 sales price. The
buyer had previously paid a $500 earnest money deposit to be applied to the purchase
pnce.
8. According to the lender's closing instructions to Defendant, the lender did not
approve any subordinate financing for the Holmes-Crowley closing. The lender's closing
instructions to Defendant stated that any deviation from these instructions must be in
writing from the lender.
9. Defendant prepared a proposed I-IUD-I Settlement Statement and submitted it
to the lender for approval. The lender approved the I-IUD-I Settlement Statement that
showed the buyer delivering $22,700 in proceeds, including the $500 earnest money
deposit.
10. The lender's closing instructions to Defendant required the Defendant to use
the HUD-I Settlement Statement that it approved to conduct the closing. The closing
instructions also required the Defendant to return the approved I-IUD-I Settlement
Statement signed by the buyer, the seller and Defendant to confirm that the transaction
was conducted in accordance with the approved HUD-I Settlement Statement.
II. The I-IUD-I Settlement Statement signed by the buyer and Defendant amI that
was contained in the lender's file had a signature that pUllJorted to be the signature of the
seller but was a forgery.
12. The HUD-I Settlement Statement signed by the buyer and Defendant and that
was contained in the lender's file showed that the buyer provided cash proceeds,
including earnest money deposited, in the amount of $22,700.00.
13. Although there was no direct evidence, the reasonable inference from the
requirements in the lender's closing instructions and the content of its file is that
Defendant was the source of the HUD-I Settlement Statement with the seller's forged
signature that showed the buyer providing $22,700 in cash proceeds at the closing.
14. The buyer did not provide cash proceeds in the amount of $22,700.00 for the
closing.
IS. Actually, the buyer did not provide any cash proceeds other than a $500.00
earnest money deposit. Instead, the buyer obtained a $14,800.00 loan from National

2

Home and a $7,400.00 loan from the seller for the $22,200 in cash proceeds required by
the lender to be provided by the buyer at closing.
!6. Also, the buyer borrowed an additional $2,000 from the seller to cover other
costs the buyer incurred in cOlmection with the closing.
!7. The HUD-1 Settlement Statement that Defendant provided to the lender
failed to disclose any of these loans. Instead, the HUD-! Settlement Statement
Defendant provided to the lender made it appear that the buyer had brought $22,200 in
cash to the closing.
18. The HUD-l Settlement Statement that Defendant reviewed with the parties
present at closing was different than the HUD-l Settlement Statement contained in the
lender's file in that it showed the $14,800.00 loan from National I-lome as a "Commission
Earned." The HUD-! Settlement Statement signed by Defendant and contained in the
lender's file did not make any reference to the loan from National Home - not as a loan
or as a "Commission Earned."
19. The HUD-I Settlement Statement that Defendant reviewed with the parties
present at closing was different than the HUD-! Settlement Statement in the lender's file
in that it showed the $9,400.00 seller's loan as a $7,400.00 "Down Payment." The HUD! Settlement Statement signed by Defendant and contained in the lender's me did not
make any reference to the loan from seller - not as a loan or as a "Down Payment."
20. Defendant knew at the time of closing that the buyer did not provide cash
proceeds in the anlount of$22,700.00.
21. Defendant knew at tlle time of closing that the buyer obtained a $!4,800.00
loan from National Home and a $9,400.00 loan from the seller.
22. Defendant purposefnlly misrepresented on the HUD-! Settlement Statement
that she provided to the buyer and seller that the buyer's National Home loan was a
"Commission Eamed" and the seller's loan was a "Down Payment."
23. Defendant knew that her representations that the National Home loan was a
"Commission Earned" and the seller's loan was a "Down Payment"' were false
representations.
24. Defendant concealed from the lender the fact that contrary to its closing
instructions, the buyer obtained subordinate financing to support his purchase of the
property located at 11928 Little Stoney Court in Charlotte, North Carolina.
25. The lender was not present at the Holmes-Crowley Closing.
26. The lender relied on Defendant to protect its interests at closing.

3

27. Defendant failed to protect the interests of the lender at closing.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Hearing Panel enters the
following
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. All parties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the Panel has jurisdiction
over Defendant, Sybil H. Barrett, and the subject matter.
2. Defendant's conduct as set out in the Findings of Fact above constitutes
grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28(b)(2) in that Defendant
violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as follows:
a. By falsely representing on the HUD-l Settlement Statement that she provided
to the buyer and seller for the Holmes-Crowley Closing that the proceeds of
the National Home loan were a "Commission Earned" and the seller's loan
was a "Down Payment," and by providing the lender with a [-IUD-I
Settlement Statement that failed to disclose these loans, Defendant committed
a criminal act that reflects adversely on her honesty, trustworthiness or fitness
as a lawyer in violation of Rule 8.4(b), and engaged in conduct involving
dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c): and
b. By concealing from the lender the fact that the buyer obtained subordinate
financing for his purchase of 11928 Little Stoney Court in Charlotte, North
Carolina, Defendant engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, tl'aud, deceit or
misrepresentation in violation of Rule S.4( c).
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and the
evidence presented at the hearing, the Heming Panel hereby makes by clear, cogent and
convincing evidence tile following:
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I. Defendmlt refused to comply with the Hearing Panel's 13 January 2011 order

compelling her to respond to discovery requests the State Bar served on her in September
2010.
2. Defendant's conduct negatively impacted the seller's perception oflawyers
and the legal profession in that the seller previously trusted lawyers to perform their job
but now does not as a result of his experience with Defendant in the Holmes-Crowley
Closing,.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Additional
Findings Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Pmlel enters the following:

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1. The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27 N.C.A.C.
IB § .01 14(w)(l)(2), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar and concludes that the
following factors that warrant Defendant's disbarment are present:
a. intent of the defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential
harm is foreseeable;
b. circumstances reflecting the defendant's lack of honesty,
trustworthiness, or integrity;
c. negative impact on client's or public's perception of the profession;
d. the negative impact of the defendant's actions on the administration of
justice; and
e. impainnent of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the
representation.
2. The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
IB § .0114(w)(3), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar and concludes that the
following factors are applicable in this matter:
a. dishonest or selfish motive; and
b. Defendant's bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceedings by
refusing to comply with the State Bar's discovery requests served in
September 20 I O.
3. Defendant's conduct caused significant harm or potential significant ha1111 to
her clients, the public, the administration of justice and the legal profession in that her
actions bring the legal profession into disrepute.
4. Defendant's dishonesty to her lender client and her failure to protect the
interests of her lender client at the Holmes-Crowley Closing caused potential significant
harm to her lender client in that this failure resulted in the lender advancing 94% of the
purchase price to Earl Holmes, Jr. as a loan as opposed to 85% of the purchase price, the
amount the lender determined was appropriate.
5. Defendant's refusal to comply with the 13 January 2011 Hearing Panel order
compelling Defendant to respond to the State Bar's discovery requests caused harm to the
legal profession by interfering with the State Bar's ability to regulate attorneys and
undermining the privilege of lawyers in this State to remain self-regulating. Even
without the harm caused by Defendant's refusal to cooperate with discovery, disbarment
is the appropriate discipline in this case.

5

6. The Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and finds that disbarment
is the only appropriate discipline in this case for the following reasons:
a. Defendant's conduct constituted criminal acts and involved intentional dishonesty
toward her client and others; Defendant's attitude toward this proceeding, as
shown by her intentional failure to comply with the orders of the tribunal. exhibits
a disregard by Defendant for her obligations to the profession and as an officer of
the court:
b. Protection of the public and the legal profession requires that Defendant not be
pennitted to resume the practice oflaw until she demonstmtes that: (i) she has
reformed, (ii) that she understands her obligations to her clients, the public and
the legal profession, (iii) that she possesses the moral qualifications required for
admission to practice law in this state, and (iv) that permitting her to practice law
will not be detrimental to the public or the integrity and standing of the legal
profession or the administration of justice; disbarment is the only sanction that
requires Defendant to make such a showing;
c. The factors under Rule .0114(w) that are established by the evidence of this case
are of the type that support disbam1ent as the appropriate discipline; There are no
factors that mitigate Defendant's conduct;
d. Imposing discipline less than disbmment would fail to acknowledge the
seriousness of the offense committed by Defendm1t and would send the wTong
message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct expected of members
of the State Bar.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Findings ofFael
Regarding Discipline and Conclusions Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel hereby
enters the following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1. Defendant, Sybil H. Barrett, is hereby DISBARRED from the practice of law
