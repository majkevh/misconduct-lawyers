Ms. McNeil pleaded with Malone to prepare the custody
order so that the transfer of custody could occur.
However, Malone never prepared the custody order.
10.

owing primarily to Malone's failure to prepare the
custody order, transfer of physical custody from Mr.
Yates to Ms. McNeil, as ordered by the court, did not
occur until August 1995.

11~

Also due to Malone's failure to prepare the custody
order;
Ms.
McNeil's
case
was
placed
on the
administrative or "clean':"'up" calendar for October 20,
1993.
Malone failed to notify Ms.. McNeil of this
court date and failed to appear at the hearing on her
behalf.
As a result, the custody case was dismissed
for failure to prosecute or to timely present

I

judgment.
12.,

Also due to
order,
Ms.

M~lorie'S

McNeil

failure to prepare the custody
:was forced to hire another

attorney, Nancy McKenzie Kizer, to:

Ms. McNeil has incurred attorney's fees of $8,67'2· as
the result of Malone's failure to prepare 9.nd :eila
the custody order as required by the court •.

14.

From April 1993 through February 1994 (when Ms .•
McNeil discharged Malone as ner attorney), Ms. McNeil
tried to reach Malone by telephone on at least,
eighteen different occasions to determine the statu~
of her case.
Each time, ~s. McNeil left· a nie$sac;Je
for Malone to return her call. However, Malone only
returned two of these phone calls and during these
conversations, assured Ms. McNeil that he was working
on her case.

15.

From July 1993 through December 1993, Ms. McNeil made
four appointments to see Malone concerning the statu$
of her case •
Howeve:r , Ms. McNeil was only ab~e to

meeting, Malone continued to assure Ms. McNeil that
he was working on her case.
16.

17~

'In the spring of 1993, Malone ceased doing any
further work on behalf of Ms. McNeil and in effect,
terminated the attorney-client relationship with Ms.
McNeil.
However, before terminating his attorneyclient
relationship,
Malone
failed
to
obtain
permission from the court to withdraw., and failed to
prepare the custody order which, as indicated above,
resulted in significant harm to Ms. McNeil.

I

Malone testified at the hearing that he deliberately
withheld the preparation and filing of the final
custody order because that was the only work he had
remaining to do and if it were done, he would have no
further leverage by which he could "coerce" (Malone'S
exact word) the remainder of his fee from Ms. McNeil.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the committee
enters the following Conclusions of Law:
1.
By not preparing the order in a timely fashion,
Malone failed 'to act with reasonable diligence and
promptness in representing Ms. McNeil in violation of
:Rule 6(b) (3), and intenti.onally prejudiced or damaged
Ms. McNeil in violation of Rule 7.1(a) (3).

I

2.
By failing to reasonably' communicate with Ms.
McNeil concerning her d,ase and promptly comply with
reasonable requests for information, Malone violated
Rule 6(b) (1).
3.
By withdrawing as Ms. McNeil's attorney without
obtaining permission of the court, Malone violated
Rule 2.S(a) (1).
