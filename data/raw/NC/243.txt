The undersigned, being first duly sworn, hereby states as follows:
I, George B. Herndon, hereby tender my license to practice law

implications of submitting the resignation.
I am aware that there is presently an investigation regarding
allegations that I have been guilty of misconduct, to wit: plea of
guilty to the charge that I received, in currency, approximately
$78,779.00, in two or more related transactions and unlawfully
failed to file a Form 8300, also known as a currency transaction
report, with the Internal Revenue Service in violation of Title 26,
untied States Code, Section 60501 and Rule 1.2(b) of the Rules of
Professional Conduct.
I acknowledge that the
is predicated are true. I
know that if charges were
investigation, I would not

I am also aware that the State Bar is performing an audit on
my trust account. I hereby stipulate and agree that the President
of the N. C. State Bar has jurisdiction to amend the order of
disbarment nunc pro tunc, and make additional findings and
conclusions if the Grievance Committee finds probable cause to
believe that I engaged in misconduct in the matter currently under
investigation.
If the Grievance Committee finds probable cause but the
parties cannot agree about the terms of the amended disbarment
order, I hereby stipulate that the Disciplinary Hearing Commission

has jurisdiction to consider such additional allegations of
misconduct and to enter whatever order of discipline it deems
appropriate, after hearing.
I further stipulate that, in such
case, the Disciplinary Hearing Commission will have the authority
to enter a prospective order of discipline, which would take effect
at the conclusion of the term of disbarment and will not be limited
to imposing discipline which would run concurrently with the term
of disbarment.
This affidavit is submitted pursuant to Subchapter B, Section
.0017 of the Discipline and Disability Rules.
I am aware that I
have 30 days from the date of the filing of this affidavit to wind
down my practice in accordance with Sections .0117(e) and .0124.
