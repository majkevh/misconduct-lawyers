peti tion with the U. S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle Di·striQ,t

Prior to l\fovember 1993, Bodenheimer claimed that the
Brookses were in default on their loan. Bodenheimer contacted the
Defendant and directed him to file a motion fc;>r relief from the
stay in bankruptcy cou~t, so that he could foreclose on nis loan.
10. Defendant filed the motion for relief from the stay and
a hearing was held before the Honorable Jerry G. Tart on December
14, 1993.
Judge Tart ru,led that Bodenheimer's motion would be
granted unless the Brookses secured a purchase contract on the
property by January 14, 1994.
11. The Brookses did not secure a purchase contract by
January 14, 1994 and Bodenheimer directed Defendant to proceed with'
foreclosure proceedings.

(Idol), the attorney for the Brookses.
Enclosed with the letter
was the sum of $5,500, with instructions that the money be applied
to any arrearages, principal and interest owed to Bodenheimer by
the Brookses, and that any excess "be applied to any accrued costs
and attorney's f$es that (sic) which the lender is entitled to
recover".

filed
amotion

alleging that the Brookses were in default· on the Bodenheimer deed
of trust.

delivered to Pefendant additional checks totalling $5,580.

$5;500 payment.
