Based UPOIl the foregoing FindiIigs of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the Hearing
CoIl1!llittee hereby makes the following:
FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.

2.

Defendant's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
a.

Multiple offenses; and

b.

Substantial experience in the practice of law.

Defendant's misconduct is mitigated by the following factorS:
a.

Absence of a prior disciplin~ry recorq;

b.

Absence of a dishonest or selfish motive;

c.

Full and free disclosure to the Hearing Comfnittee Or cooperative attitude
toward the proceedings;

I
3.

d.

Character and reputation; and

e.

clients, the Gordon Estate and the Riggs Estate, and to the beneficiaries ofthose' estates.

4.

Under N.C. Gen Stat. §84-~8, a public censure is defined as a written form of discipline
more serious than a reprimand in cases ill which an attorney has viollltedone ot more
provisions ofllie Rules of Professional Conduct and has caused significant harm to a
client, the administration of justice, the legal profession, or members of the public, but
the protection of the public does not require a suspension of the attorney's license.

I

5.

pefendant has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct and
the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct and has caused significant harm to clients, to
beneficiaries of the Gordon and Riggs Estates, and the profession as discussed above. In
light of such significant h~rm, the Committee fiI!ds that discipline less than a censure
,

~

would.not sufficiently protect the public. The Committee finds that a censure will be
sMficient to protect the public and that sJlspension of Defendant's license is not necessary
b~sed upon the facts as recited herein.

Basedrupon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and the Findings Regarding

I

Discipline"the Hearing Committee enters the following:
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
