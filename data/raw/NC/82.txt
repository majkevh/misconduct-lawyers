I desire to resign and hereby tender my license to practice law in North
Carolina pursuant to the provisions of Section .0 117 of Subchapter 1B of the
Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar.

2.	

My resignation is freely and voluntarily rendered. It is not the result of
coercion or duress. I am fully aware of the implication of submitting my
resignation.

allegations that I have been guilty of misconduct by conspiring to engage in
mortgage fraud and participating in said fraud by actions taken in the course
of closing real estate sales and by distributing funds differently than as stated
on the HUD-l Settlement Statement. A Bill of Infomlation has been tiled
against me in the United States District Court for the Western District of
North Carolina alleging conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 and a plea
agreement has been tiled, signed by me, in which I agree to enter a plea of
guilty.

4.	

1 acknO\vledge that the material facts upon which the investigation
predicated are true.

s.	

My resignation is being submitted because I know that if charges were
predicated upon the misconduct under investigation, I could not successfully
defend against them.
