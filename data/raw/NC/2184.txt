conduct co~ld jeopardize her potential civil ciaims against her assailant and the University,
which were,the claims the Do'es had retained hini to pursue.
40.

Knight's conduct of engaging in sexual relations with Ms. Doe prejudiced or

The release Knight enclosed with his April 20 letter purported to release Knight

frOIn all civil liability.in connection with his representation of the Does or any misconduct
committed by him during the representation ..

'.',

In his April,20 letter to the Does, Knight told the Does that he would refund the.

47.

$9,000 retainer .only on the condition that the Does all sign the release.

I

48.

Knight knew that Mr. Doe paid the $9,000 retainer by withdrawing the funds front

his retirement 'accountJ and that the Does did not otherwise have the funds to pay a fee

to retain

an attorn~y.
49.

Knight believed that the Does would retain another attorney after he returned their'

file and fee.
50.

Before sending the release, Knight reviewed the Revised ;Rule,S of Professional

Conduct.
'. 51.

Knight did not advise the Does that they should seek independent legal

representation in the April 20th letter or release.
After he sent the April 20th letteratid release, I<night contacted the Does by

52.

I

telephone. During these conversations, Knight failed to advise the Does that they should seek

ind\lPendeI\t legal r\lPresentation in connection with the release.
53.

Knight never advised the Does to seek independent legal representation in

connection with the reiease before they filed a grievance with the North Carolina State Bat. and
retained another attorney.
Knight's intent when he sent them the April 20 th letter and release was to prevent

54..

the·Does from bringing: a eivil suit :against him for his conduct whilerepresi:mt~ng them.

Knight's intent in co.nditio.ning the return o.f the fee o.n the executio.n o.f release

was to. get the Do.es to. sign a· liability release befo.re they retained ano.ther atto.rney.
56.

The Do.es"did no.t sign the release prepared by Knight.

57.

Knight did no.t repo.rt his misconduct to the State Bar until he discQvered that Ms.

Do.e had told her parents that he had engaged in sexual relations with her.
58.

Thereafter, on April 20, 2000, Knight sent a letter to the No.rth Carollna State Bar

repo.rting that he had had sexual relatio.ns with a client in violation of ReVised Rule 1.18 of the

I

Rules of ProfessIonal Conduct.
Knight's April 20, 2000 letter, which was dated the same day as his letter and

59.

release to the does, did hot disclose the fat that he had requested the Do.es to. sign a release from
liability.
60.

It was not until after the Do.es retained another attorney that Knight returp.ed the

$9,000 retainer fee paid by the Do~s.
Based llP()h the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Hearing Co.mmittee enters the follqwifig:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
A~l parties are pro.perly before the Hearing Committee, and the Hearing

1.

Committee has jurisdiction over Knight and the subj ect matter of this proceeding.
2.

Knight's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, co.nstitutes gr9unds for

discipline pursuant to. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28(b)(2) and the No.rth Catolina Revised Rules o.f

S.~(g).'.~N·I}

.,'': ,

By conditioning the return of the Does' $9,000 retainer fee on executing a r~le,ase
from liability, Knight attempted to settle a claim for liability against him with
unrepresented former clients, without first advising them in Writing to ,Se~k
independent represelltation in cOllllection therewith, .an attempted violation of
Revised Rule 1.8(h), in violation of Revised Rule SA(a).

FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.

Knight's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:

a.

dishonest or selfish motive;
a pattern of misconduct;
vulnerability ofthe victim; and
prejudice and damage to the clients.

b.
c.

2.

,

Knight's misconduct-is mitigated by the following factors:

toward the proceedings;
character and reputation; and
remorse ..

b.

.'

c.
d.

'.

The aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors.
