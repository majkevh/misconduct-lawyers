Based upon the pleadings in this matter, the pmiies' stipulations of fact, and with
the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel hereby enters the following:

FINDINGS OF FACT
1.
Plaintiff, the NOlth Carolina State Bar ("State Bar"), is a body duly
organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper patty to bring this proceeding
under the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, and
the Rules and Regulations of the NOlih Carolina State Bar (Chapter 1 of Title 27 of the
NOlth Carolina Administrative Code).
?
Defendant, James N. Jorgensen ("Defendant" or "Jorgensen"), was
admitted to the NOlih Carolina State Bar on April 5, 1996, and is, and was at all times
referred to herein, an attorney at law licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the
laws of the State of North Carolina, the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar, and the Rules of Professional Conduct.

3.
During all or part of the relevant periods referred to herein, Jorgensen was
engaged in the practice of law in Raleigh, Wake County, North Carolina.
First Claim for Relief
4.
The Wilber Lane Law Firm ("firm"), Bloomington, Illinois, engaged
Defendant to litigate 17 subrogation files on behalf of various insurance companies in
which they had advanced court costs to cover the litigation expenses.
5.
Under his alTangement with the finn, Defendant was required to obtain the
best outcomes possible by filing lawsuits, moving the cases forward in the civil court
system, providing status updates to the firm on behalf of the insurance company clients
when requested, and issuing payments to the firm on behalf of the insurance company
clients upon resolutions or settlements in the matters.
6.
The firm served as the agent for the insurance company clients and was
designated to make regular inquiries about the status of the actions on behalf of its
insurance company clients, receive any subrogation funds owed to the insurance company
clients by the defendants, and receive any balance of the advanced comi costs on behalf of
the insurance company clients.
7.
Defendant complied by filing the initial lawsuits, but numerous requests by
the firm for status updates went unanswered by Defendant.
8.
When the finn's representatives contacted the courts where the lawsuits
were filed, they learned that the courts had dismissed the matters for want of prosecution,
the cases "vere still pending with no activity, or the cases were on the list to be dismissed.
9.
After Defendant received an Admonition in No. 12GO 119 at the Grievance
Committee's January 2013 Quarterly Meeting, his communication with the firm about the
status of the cases improved for a short time, but then decreased.
10.
The firm attempted to telephone, left voicemail messages for, and e-mailed
Defendant requesting updates on the status of its clients' cases and the money owed by
Defendant to the clients, but Defendant was unresponsive.
II.
The firm requested that Defendant return all of its clients' files, as well as
the remaining amounts owed on each file, but Defendant did not promptly comply with the
request.
12.
The firm also expressed concerns to Defendant about its cases he had settled
without promptly remitting all of the funds owed to the firm.
13.
In the Jeffrey Gore matter, Defendant reached a settlement in March 2013
for $5,600 and remitted some of the money from that settlement to the firm, but then ceased
making the payments.
2

14.
In the Micah McCleary matter, Defendant received some payments from an
Octo bel' 24, 2012 judgment, and informed the firm that he would forward the payments,
but did not do so.
15.
In the Janet Lancaster matter, involving an October 24,2012 judgment in
the amount of$15,000, the 11rm received only $300 from Defendant in 2013.
16.
In early October 20] 4, Defendant e-mailed the firm that he would be
sending payments on these mes, but he had not done so as of the end of October 2014.
17.
The State Bar served Defendant with a Letter of Notice in the underlying
grievance (14G0860) on March 30, 2015.
18.
After Defendant requested and received an extension of time to file his
response to the Letter of Notice, Defendant's response was due on May 4,2015.
19.
The State Bar did not receive Defendant's response until June 10,2015,
almost one month past its due date.

Second Claim for Relief
20.
The Rathbone Group, LLC ("Rathbone"), based in Cleveland, Ohio,
formerly known as Javitch, Block & Rathbone, retained Defendant to obtain ajudgment or
other appropriate relief on behalf of the subrogee plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company ("State Farm"), against Donna Wattinne ("Ms. Wattilme") and her
son, Eric Allan Wattinne, jointly and severally for damages arising from a March 20, 2008
motor vehicle accident in Cabanus County, NOlih Carolina.
21.
Rathbone served as the agent for State Farm and was designated to receive
any subrogation funds owed to State Farm by Ms. Wattinne and her son.
22.
On September 9, 2009, Defendant filed the action against Ms. Wattine and
her son in State Farm lvlufual Automobile Insurance Company, as subrogee of Charles
Edwin McLean, Jr. v. Eric Allan W'aftinne and Donna Marie Waftinne, No. 09-CVD-18264
(Wake Co. Dist. Ct.).
23.
Defendant served process on Ms. Wattinne and her son, and on December
8, 2011 obtained a default judgment against the defendants in the amount of $6,922.75.
24.
Defendant then petitioned the NOlih Carolina Department of Motor
Vehicles ("DMV") to suspend the driver's licenses of both Ms. Wattinne and her son.
25.
After negotiations with Ms. Wattinne's and her son's attorney, the parties
agreed that Ms. Wattinne would make monthly payments of $150, payable to "James N.
Jorgensen, P.A. Trust Account" in exchange for State Farm's agreement to refrain from
enforcing the judgment, including the suspensions of Ms. Wattine's and her son's driver's
licenses.

3

26.
Based upon the agreement, Defendant withdrew his previous petition to
suspend Ms. WattilU1e's and her son's driver's licenses.
27.
Starting in September 2012, Ms. Wattinne began making the monthly
payments to Defendant, including 40 payments of $150 (fi'om September 2012 to
December 2015) totaling $6,000, and four payments in the amounts of $150, $150, $500,
and $122.75, respectively, all four of which were received by Defendant in an envelope
postmarked February 19,2016.
28.
The payments by Ms. Wattinne to Defendant totaled $6,922.75,
representing the principal amount of the judgment, but Ms. Wattinne's payments did not
include any pre-judgment or post-judgment interest as required by the judgment.
29.
As an accommodation to Ms. Wattinne and her son, State Farm agreed to
waive all pre-judgment and post-judgment interest.
On June 16,2016, Defendant filed a celiificate on behalf of State Farm
30.
indicating that Ms. Wattine and her son had rendered payment in full and satisfied the
judgment.
31.
Defendant did not promptly remit to Rathbone on behalf of State Farm the
collections he received from Ms. Wattinne.
32.
Defendant made disbursements to Rathbone in late 2012 and early 2013,
totaling $900 ($225, check no. 332998, on Nov. 3, 2012; $225, check no. 332929, on Nov.
20,2012; $225, check no. 333056, on Jan. 17,2013; and, $225, check no. 333087, on Feb.
27,2013).
33.
Between February 27, 2013 and February 14,2016, a period of nearly three
years, Defendant made no additional remittances to Rathbone despite records showing that
he continued to accumulate Ms. Wattinne's payments of over $4,000 in his trust account
during the same period.
34.
Starting in February 2016, Defendant made the following disbursements to
Rathbone: $337.50, check no. 333744, on Feb. 14,2016; $225, check no. 333765, on Feb.
15,2016; $675, check no. 333795, on Feb. 14,2016 but not received by Rathbone until
Apr. 4, 2016; $900, check no. 333802, on Feb. 14,2016 but not received by Rathbone until
Apr. 4, 2016; $692.06, check no. 333806, on Mar. 22, 2016 but not received by Rathbone
until Apr. 4, 2016; and, $1,462.50, check no. 333808, on Mar. 24, 2016 but not received
by Rathbone until Apr. 4, 2016.
35.
The payments to Rathbone and its predecessor amounted to $5,192.06, and
appear to have been the entire principal amount to which State Farm was entitled.

4

36.
Although Defendant eventually disbursed to Rathbone all of the
disbursements to which State Farm was entitled, Defendant failed to make timely
disbursements of Ms. Wattinne's payments to Rathbone for over a three year period.

Third Claim for Relief
37.
Donnell Sawyer ("Mr. Sawyer") was injured in a motor vehicle accident on
October 25,2007.
38.
In July 2010, Mr. Sawyer filed a personal injury la\vsuit against the
defendants, Christopher Michael Liskiewicz and Michael Andrew Liskiewicz
("defendants"), through an attorney who had represented him previously on an unrelated
matter. Becoming dissatisfied with his attorney, Mr. Sawyer dismissed the attorney and
proceeded in his lawsuit pro se.
39.
The defendants offered Mr. Sawyer $10,000 to settle, but Mr. Sawyer
refused the offer.
40.
Following mediation, Mr. Sawyer took a voluntary dismissal of his initial
lawsuit and on June 7, 2012 Mr. Sawyer retained attorney Alton R. Williams ("Mr.
Williams") to represent him in refiling the lawsuit.
41.
The contingent fee agreement signed by Iv1r. Sawyer did not disclose that
Mr. Williams would be associating another attorney in the lawsuit; it only indicated that
Mr. Williams would be performing the legal services on behalf of Mr. Sawyer.
42.
Mr. Sawyer turned over his case file to Mr. Williams, and Mr. Williams
indicated that he would work on Mr. Sawyer's case with another attorney, but Mr. Williams
did not identify the attorney at that time.
43.
Mr. Williams thereafter collaborated with Defendant about refiling the
lawsuit on behalf of Mr. Sawyer.
44.
Mr. Williams and Defendant filed a new lawsuit against the defendants on
August 1, 2012, Donnell Sawyer v. Christopher lviichael Lishewicz and Michael AndreII'
Liskiewicz, No. 12-CVS-10848 (Wake Co. Sup. Ct.) ("Lishewicz"). Both Defendant and
Mr. Williams signed the Liskiewicz lawsuit on behalf of Mr. Sawyer.
45.
Mr. Sawyer contacted Mr. Williams over the next several months to check
on the status of his case, but Mr. Williams did not return his telephone calls or reply to his
text messages.
46.
Mr. Sawyer never received an update from Mr. Williams or Defendant
about the status of his case.
47.
Mr. Sawyer was unaware of Defendant's role or appearance on his behalf
in the Liskiewicz lawsuit.
5

48.
On June 19,2013, Mr. Sawyer's Uskiewicz lawsuit was discontinued due
to the lack of service on the Liskiewicz defendants.
49.
In the latter part of2013, Mr. Sawyer was informed by Mr. Williams for the
first time that Defendant was handling Mr. Sawyer's Liskiell'icz lawsuit.
50.

Defendant at the time had an office in the same building as Mr. Williams.

51.
Defendant periodically renewed the summons in the Liskiewicz lawsuit after
having difficulty serving the defendants with the summons and complaint.
52.
After learning about Defendant's role, Mr. Sawyer thereafter met with
Defendant about the status of his Liskiewicz lawsuit.
53.
Defendant informed Mr. Sawyer that he was going to serve the defendants
in Mr. Sawyer's lawsuit, but he never did so via personal service or by publication.
54.
On July 24, 2014, Defendant wrote a letter to the attorney, John Walker
("Mr. Walker"), for the defendants' insurance company, with the letter copied to Mr.
Sawyer.
55.
Immediately after sending the letter to Mr. Walker, Defendant renewed the
summons in the Liskiewicz lawsuit, but had last done so on September 19,2013, over ten
months earlier.
56.
Mr. Sawyer infom1ed Defendant that Mr. Walker no longer worked at the
law firm, but Defendant did not resend the letter to Mr. Walker's successor.
57.
A few days before Christmas 2014, Mr. Sawyer met with Defendant. When
Mr. Sawyer asked Defendant about the status of his Liskiewicz lawsuit, Defendant refused
to tell him the status.
58.
Defendant admitted to Mr. Sawyer that he had missed a deadline in the
reissuance of the summons in the Liskiewicz lawsuit in 2013, and therefore the summons
had lapsed.
59.
Defendant asked Mr. Sawyer ifhe could pay Mr. Savvyer a $10,000 "down
payment" from his own personal funds and try to get the rest from a settlement with the
defendants, but Mr. Sawyer refused Defendant's offer.
60.
The State Bar served Defendant with a Letter of Notice in this matter
(15G0022) on March 30, 2015, and Defendant was originally due to file his response on or
before April 14,2015.
61.
After requesting and receiving an extension of time to me his response to
the Letter of Notice, Defendant's response was due on May 4, 2015, but, without further

6

request or extension of time, the State Bar did not receive his response until one month
later, on June 4, 2015.
Fourth Claim for Relief
62.
Karen McVicker ("Ms. McVicker") retained Defendant to represent her and
Dr. Massoud Mohammadi' s ("Dr. Mohammadi") companies, Atlantic Integrated
Tec1mologies, Inc. ("AlT'''), and ATCO International, Inc., ("ATCO") against Bank of
America Corporation, doing business as Bank of America, N.A. ("BANA").
63.
ATCO acted as the broker in negotiating the sale and purchase of bulk
platinum for a buyer. Ms. McVicker was the primary contact person tor AlT and ATCO,
and operated under the direction of Dr. Mohammadi.
64.
A TCO was entitled to a commission on the total sales price upon the closing
of the platinum transaction.

6S.
On or about March 14,2001, AIT, at the suggestion of a BANA employee
in Singapore, opened an escrow account with BANA for the purpose of depositing the
escrow sum of $200,000 with BANA to cover potential transactional costs.
66.
By AprilS, 2001, AIT deposited the escrow sum of$20S,000 at a Raleigh
branch of BANA ("BANA Cameron Village"), which was then wired from the BANA
Cameron Village branch to a Singapore branch of BANA.
67.
BANA agreed to release the $200,000 from AIT's escrow account only
upon satisfaction of certain specified conditions.
68.
Despite the seller's failure to satisfy the specific conditions of the
agreement, and over the protests of Ms. McVicker and agents of AIT, BANA released the
$200,000 held in the AlT escrow account to the seller.
69.
ArT and ATCO claimed that BANA's breach of fiduciary duty prevented
the buyers and seller from concluding the platinum transaction, and thus precluded ATCO
from receiving its commission, causing AlT to lose the $200,000.
Represented by another attorney, Ms. McVicker and Dr. Mohammadi, on
70.
behalf of AIT and A TCO, initially filed their action against Bank of America Corporation
in Wake County Superior Court in Atlantic Integrated Technologies, Inc., and A Tea
Intel'l1ational, Inc. v. Bank (?fAmerica CO/p .. No. 04-CVS-5639 (Wake Co. Sup. Ct.), but
that action was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs on November 1,2004.
71.
Subsequently, on May 2, 200S, AIT and ATCO filed another action against
BANA in Wake County Superior Court, but that action was dismissed on October 17,2006
because it was brought against the wrong entity. Atlantic Integrated Technologies, Inc.,
and ATCO International, Inc. v. Bank ~f America C01p., No. 05-CVS-S823 (Wake Co.
Sup. Ct.).

7

72.
After being retained by Ms. McVicker and Dr. Mohammadi, on May 18,
2011 Defendant initially refiled their action in Wake County District Court, Atlantic
Integrated Technologies, Inc., and ATCa Internaaonal, Inc. v. Bank (~lAl/1erica, N.A., No.
11-CVD-5823 (Wake Co. Dist. Ct.).
73.
Threatened by BANA's counsel \vith sanctions, on December 16,2011,
Defendant filed a voluntary dismissal of the Wake County action without prejudice.
74.
Ms. McVicker and Dr. Mohammadi insisted that Defendant re-file their
action in Guilford County Superior Court without delay.
75.
ATCO paid Defendant over $9,000 expecting that he would file and
diligently pursue the action in Guilford County Superior Court.
On December 17, 2012, Defendant re-filed the complaint in Atlantic
76.
Integrated Technologies, Inc., and ATCa International, Inc. v. Bank ofAmerica, N.A., No.
12-CVS-11349 (Guilford Co. Sup. Ct.) ("AITIATCO").
77.
The AIT/ATea case was ordered to mediated settlement conference and
scheduled for administrative hearings on April 24, 2013, May 29, 2013, and June 26, 2013.
78.
The court subsequently scheduled this action for a July 1, 2013 "clean up"
calendar session.
79.
seSSIOn.

Defendant failed to appear on behalf of AIT/ATCa for the July 1, 2013

80.
On July 1,2013, Superior Court Judge John O. Craig, III entered an order
dismissing the AfT/ATCa action without prejudice due to Defendant's failure to obtain
service upon BANA and Defendant's failure to appear at the hearing on July 1,2013.
81.

Defendant did not discover the dismissal by Judge Craig until December

2013.
82.
Knowing of the dismissal by Judge Craig, Defendant falsely communicated
to Dr. Mohammadi that a hearing date had been scheduled in the A IT/A Tea lawsuit.
83.
After learning of the dismissal in December 2013, Defendant did not timely
communicate to Ms. McVicker and Dr. Mohammadi infolll1ation about Judge Craig'S July
1,2013 dismissal without prejudice in AIT/ATCa.
84.
Approximately two and a half months later, on March 14, 2014 Defendant
met with Ms. McVicker and Dr. Mohammadi in his office, providing them a verbal and
written status report, including for the first time notice of Judge Craig's July 1,2013
dismissal.
8

85.
Dr. Mohammadi subsequently contacted Defendant about continuing to
pursue the fUT/A TCO action.
On July 1,2014, Defendant filed a motion for relief in AIT/ATCO pursuant
86.
to N.C. R. Civ. P. 60 from Judge Craig's July 1, 2013 order dismissing the action without
prejudice, but the motion has never been calendared, heard or adjudicated.
87.
At a May 2015 meeting with Ms. McVicker and Dr. Mohammadi,
Defendant recommended another Guilford County judge to hear the AIT/ATCO action and
suggested hearing dates.
88.
Ms. McVicker and Dr. Mohammadi left the May 2015 meeting with the
understanding that Defendant would be sending them e-mail confirmation the next day
regarding the anticipated August 6, 2015 hearing date, but Defendant never did so.

Fifth Claim for Relief

causing the accident, Sappington v. Bunton et al., No. 13-CVS-2782 (Guilford Co. Sup.
Ct.) ("Sappington ").
92.
A summons was issued to Mr. Bunton and J. R. Tractor, and the Sappington
defendants were served on April 10, 2013.
93.
The Sappington action was scheduled for mediation in October of2013 with
a potential trial date in December of2013, but in October 2013 Defendant contacted Ms.
Sappington and informed her that the mediation had been postponed due to the need to
obtain additional medical records.
On October 15,2013, Defendant moved for a continuance, but on October
94.
24, 20 I 3 Senior Resident Superior COUlt Judge Lindsay R. Davis, Jr. denied Defendant's
motion.
On October 30, 2013, Defendant filed a voluntary dismissal without
95.
prejudice in Sappington.

9

96.
Sapping/on.

Defendant never informed Ms. Sappington about the voluntary dismissal in

97.
Over the course of the next six to eight months, Ms. Sappington left
numerous voice mail messages for Defendant and sent him e-mail messages attempting to
check on the status of her case, but Defendant never responded.

Defendant indicating that he was still trying to obtain certain necessary medical records.
99.
On July 19, 2014, Ms. Sappington replied bye-mail to Defendant
expressing her displeasure with his failure to communicate with her, but Defendant never
responded.

expressing her displeasure with Detendant, but Defendant did not respond.
101. Defendant confirmed that no additional medical records for Ms. Sappington
existed, but thereafter Defendant failed to take action to advance Ms. Sappington's case.
102. The State Bar served Defendant with a Letter of Notice (15G0230) on
March 30,2015, and Defendant was originally due to file his response on or before April
14,2015.
103. After requesting and receiving an extension of time to file his response to
the Letter of Notice, Defendant's response was due on May 4, 2015, but, without further
request or extension of time, the State Bar did not receive his response until almost one
month later, on June 2, 2015.

3.
Defendant's neglect of his clients and procrastination also had the potential
to cause significant harm to the standing of the profession in the eyes of the public because
it demonstrates disregard for his duties as an attorney. Such erosion of public confidence
in attorneys tends to sully the reputation of, and fosters disrespect for, the profession as a
whole. Confidence in the legal profession is the foundation for public trust in the entire
legal system.
4.
Defendant's trust accounting non-compliance endangered entrusted client
funds and caused potential significant haJ'm to his clients whose funds were placed at risk
while entrusted to Defendant's care, though no funds were misappropriated by Defendant.

In 12G0119, Defendant received an Admonition in February 2013 for client
neglect involving the same Wilber Lane Law firm.
6.
In 13G0695, Defendant received a Reprimand in April 2015 for client
neglect and failing to promptly disburse client's funds involving a similar insurance
subrogation firm.

Defendant has more than twenty-two years of experience in the practice of

law.
8.
Defendant has been cooperative, though not always timely in responding,
during the investigatory process.

Defendant continues to engage with the Lawyer's Assistance Program
("LAP"), and is in compliance with LAP's recommendations.

Defendant continues to attend counseling sessions and is in compliance with
his counselor's tTeatment recommendations.

The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and
disbarment, in considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
Based on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel makes the following:

CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLIINE
1.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the hearing panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin. Code 1B ยง .0116(ยฃ)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the
North Carolina State Bar and finds the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(A) Prior disciplinary offenses for similar client neglect;
(C) Absence of dishonest motive;
(D) Timely good faith efforts to rectify consequences of misconduct;
(F) A pattern of misconduct;
(G) Defendant engaged in multiple offenses;
(H) Effect of personal or emotional problems on the conduct;
(J) Defendant has undergone interim rehabilitation;

(K) Full and free disclosure to the hearing panel or cooperative attitude toward
the proceeding;
(P) Defendant is remorseful for his conduct;
(Q) Defendant's character or reputation;
(R) The vulnerability of the victims; and

(S) Defendant's substantial experience in the practice of law.
2.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C. Admin. Code J B ยง .0116(ยฃ)(1) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina
State Bar and finds the following factors warrant suspension of Defendant's license:
13

(B) Circumstances reflecting Defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness, or
integrity;
(E) Defendant's actions had a potential negative impact on his clients' and the
public's perception ofthe legal profession;
(F) Defendant's conduct had a negative impact on the administration of justice;
(G) Defendant's conduct impaired each client's ability to achieve the goals of
their representation; and,
(H) Defendant's conduct had an adverse effect on third parties.
3.
The hearing panel has also carefully considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N. C. Admin. Code 1B ยง .0 116(f)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the
North Carolina State Bar, and finds factor (A) is implicated (Defendant engaged in acts of
dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication), but concludes that disbarment is not
necessary in order to protect the public.
4.
The hearing panel has considered all other fOlms of discipline available and
concludes, for the following reasons, that any sanction less than suspension would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses committed by Defendant, would not
adequately protect the public, and would send the wrong message to attomeys and the
public regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar.
a. The factors under 27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง.0116(f)(l) and (f)(3) that are
established by the evidence are of a nature that support imposition
of suspension as the appropriate discipline;
b. Entry of less serious discipline would fail to acknO\vledge the
seriousness of the offenses Defendant committed and would send
the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct
expected of members of the Bar in this State; and,
c. A stayed suspension with appropriate conditions, such as requiring
Defendant to continue his therapy and periodic rep0l1ing by that
therapist to the State Bar, along with the condition of a practice
monitor and reporting by that practice monitor to the State Bar, will
assure Defendant's progress and compliance with treatment and
professional norms.
5.

Defendant should be taxed with the administrative fees and costs of this

action.
