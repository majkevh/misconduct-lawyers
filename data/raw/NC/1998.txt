justice, the profession or a member of the public, but the misconduct does nut require suspension

. The Grievance (::ommittee believes that a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing
Cornrnission is not required in this case and issues this Censure to you. As chairman of the
Griev~ce Committee of the North Carolina State Bar, it is now my duty to issue this Censure. I
am certain that you.will Understand fully the spirit in which this duty is performed:
I

; The Committee found the following facts, after reviewing all the evidence related to the
above mentioned grievance: You agreed to represent Mr. and Mrs. Thaddeus Frye in a civil
action: brought against them relating, in part, to the construction of a stiu~ture in a stream running

After taking the $2,500 fee, you neglected to take numerous actions, substantially
prejudicing the Fryes' rights in this civil matter. In particular, the Committee found that 'you: (1)
failed to forward to the Fryesand respond to the opposing party's ("Plaintiffs) tWo sets of
interrogatories, and requests for ad.m.lssions; (2) failed to inform the Fryes about Plaintiff s
motion to compel, Plaintiffs motion for suuunary judgment, and the affidavit of Plaintiff in
support of summary judgment; (3) failed to notify the Fryes ofth~ consequent order granting'
partial summary judgment in fav.br of the Plaintiff, which order waS based on the' affidavit of the
Plaintiff and the deemed admissions of the the Fryes; (4) failed to inform the Fryes that the order
for partial summary judgment included a mandatory injunction to fill and remove a ditch
. constructed by the Fryes and that f~ilure to remove it by June 1, i 996, could result in sanctions
against them; (5) failed to inform the Fryes of this order and possible ~anctions in a meeting o~
conversations with the Fryes on May 31, 1996; (6) filed a notice of appeal from the entry of
partilll summary judgment without consulting with the Fryes; and (7) repeatedly failed to return
phone calls and messages left by the Fryes about the status of the case. 'you also refused to
return voluntarily to the Fryes the $2,500 fee they paid you after you were terminated from
employment, which they requested to assist them in hiring another attorney.
