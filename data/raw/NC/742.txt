(d) By failing to timely file and serve the Wilson-Angeles, Waters, and Wilson briefs, Hunt
failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client in violation
of Rule 1.3.
Upon the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel also finds by clear, cogent, and convincing
evidence the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
When attorneys falsifY court filings, there is a potential for significant harm to the
legal profession, the administration of justice, and the public's perception of the profession.
2.
The clients Defendant represented while employed by the Appellate Defender's
Office were indigent and depended on Defendant to timely and competently pursue their
appellate matters.
3.
The Appellate Defender's Office filed motions requesting that the Court of
Appeals deem timely the filings in the three cases referred to in the above findings offact and
conclusions of law and requested that the certificates of service be corrected to reflect the correct
dates and the Court granted the motions.
4.
As a result of the prompt corrective action taken by the Appellate Defender's
Office, no client was actually harmed although the potential for harm to the clients was
significant.
5.
Defendant has voluntarily elected not to practice law since he resigned from the
Appellate Defender's Office on January 28,2017.
6.
During 2015 and 2016, Defendant experienced great stress in his personal life and
professionally.
7.
According to Defendant's psychiatrist, Defendant experienced a major depressive
episode and numerous side effects, including cognitive impairment, from the depression, the
medications and treatments therefor, which affected his work in 2015 and 2016.
8.
Defendant's psychiatrist opines that Defendant has fully recovered from these
problems and is capable of resuming the practice of law.
9.
When the misconduct described herein came to light, Defendant promptly and
voluntarily sought assistance from the Lawyer Assistance Program (LAP), participated in group
sessions through LAP, and has maintained contact with LAP.
10. Defendant also participated in individual psychotherapy sessions at Duke
University Medical Center from April 2017 through March 2018.
11.

Defendant has no prior professional discipline.

Based on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the additional Findings
of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearing Panel considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code IB.Ol16(t)(1) and concludes that the following factors are applicable:

(a) intent of the defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential harm is
foreseeable;
(b) circumstances reflecting the defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness, or integrity;
(c) negative impact of defendant's actions on client's or public's perception of the
profession;
(d) negative impact of the defendant's actions on the administration of justice;
(e) effect of defendant's conduct on third parties; and
(t) acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication.
2.
The Hearing Panel considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code IB.Ol16(t)(2) and concludes that the following factor is applicable:
(a) acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication.
3.
The Hearing Panel considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code. 1B. 0 116(t)(3) and concludes the foIl owing factors are applicable:
(a) absence of prior disciplinary offenses in this state or any other jurisdiction;
(b) dishonest or selfish motive;
(c) a pattern of misconduct;
(d) multiple offenses;
(e) effect of any personal or emotional problems on the conduct in question and
Defendant's subsequent efforts to address those problems;
(t) effect of any physical or mental disability or impairment on the conduct in question;
(g) full and free disclosure to the hearing panel or cooperative attitude toward the
proceedings;
(h) vulnerability of victim; and

NCSB v. Jonathan Holmes Hunt, 18 DHC 37
Consent Order
Page 5 of10

(i) degree of experience in the practice of law.
4.
The Hearing Panel considered all of the different forms of discipline available to
it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and disbarment, in considering the
appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
5.
The Hearing Panel concludes that discipline short of suspension would not
adequately protect the public for the following reasons:
a) Defendant's conduct reflects adversely on his trustworthiness and fitness as an
attorney;
b) Entry of an order imposing less severe discipline would fail to acknowledge the
seriousness of the misconduct and would end the wrong message to attorneys
about conduct expected of members of the Bar of this State.
6.
Ordinarily, the type of misconduct present here would warrant a period of active
suspension. However, the DHC has determined that a stayed suspension is appropriate given the
particular facts and circumstances of this case, to include lack of any prior disciplinary history,
lack of actual client harm, the Defendant's admission of wrongdoing and cooperation with the
proceedings, the emotional and personal problems that Defendant experienced, and his voluntary
decision not to engage in the practice of law for the past seventeen months while he addressed
his mental health issues and made significant strides in that regard.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and the additional
Findings of Fact and Conclusions Regarding Discipline, and with the consent of the parties, the
Hearing Panel hereby enters the following:
