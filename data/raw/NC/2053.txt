.

TIns CAUSE coming on to be heard befote the undersigned Superior Court Judge presiding at
the Octqber 15, 1998 session of the Civil Superior Court ofDutham County, North Carolli,ta, upon the
Order to Show Cause as to counsel for the plaintiffs, Walter E. Ricks, ill issued by the Honorable David
Q. LaBatte on September 29, 1998. The defendant, J. R Outlaw was present and represented by Charles
F. Carpenter. The pWntiflS Were not present nor was Mr. Ricks. The Court, having reviewed the file and
having ~en sworn evidence in the case, hereby makes the following findings of fact:,
1.

The Order to ShoW' Cause of September 29, 1998 was timely seIVed upon Mr. Ricks as

attorney of record for the plaiIitiffs, and therefore the plaintiffs and Mr. Ricks had due and prop'er notice
of the hearing.
2.

Mr. Ricks fuiled to appear before this Court after receiving proper notice to respond both

on behalf ofhis clients and on behalf ofhimseH: and has therefore miled to explain or demonstrate why
he has falled to pay the attorney's fees taxed against him by the Court's order of July 21, 1998, and to
otherwis~

3.;

comply with other provisions of the Court's order.
The fuilure of Mr. Ricks to comply with the Court's orders constitutes a pattern of practice

and conduct exhibited in this case by Mr. Ricks.

I

Based upon the foregoing findings of fuct, the Court hereby concludes

~

a matter of law as

follows:
1.

Mr. Ricks has wilIfully and intentionally fuiled to comply with the orders of this Court

and has fiilled to explain or demonstrate why he has fiilled to do so, and such fuilurc; folloWS a pattern of
practice and conduct by Mr. Ricks in this case.

I

2.

The conduct ofMr. Ricks places him in contempt ofthis Court, and the Court is impelled

to impose sanctions on Mr. Ricks.

3.

The conduct of~. Ricks and his representation of his clients in this inatter and in his

own conduct before the Court in fuiling to comply with duly and lawfully entered orders Qf the Court
constitutes conduct which is unacceptable to the :fitir administration ofjustice by the courts in Durham
County, North Carolina, and therefore the CoUrt should suspend Mr. Ricks from practicing law in the
courts of Durham County, North Carolina.
4.

Bya separate order, the Court has found the plaintiffs in contempt iJ1 this matt~r, and the

Court bas imposed sanctions upon the plaintiffs including a dismissal with prejudice ofthis action, and
the imposition of attorney's fees in fu.vor of the defendant J. R Outlaw. The Court considers as an
additional sanction against Mr. Ricks, that hebe held jointly and severally liable with the plaintiffs for
Mr. Outlaw's attorney's fees in the amount of $

imposed in this order would be appropriate, and has concluded that the sanctions imposed herein are .
entirely appropriate and arc; the least severe sanctions that the Court can impose under the circumstances.
