Pursuant to Section 13 (10) 'of the a:fotesaid rules, the cQmmittee' f01,lt).q,
probable cause. Probable cause is defined as: "A finding by the Grievan¢e

The rules also provide that if, after a finding of prop<:\ple cause, the

issues this Public Censure to you.
As Chairman of the Grievanc'e Commit·tee of the North Carol:i.na S1:a't·e .1}a.r,
I amcert,iin that you will
understand fully the spirit in which this duty is performed.
The, fact tha·t a
Public Censure is not the most serious discipline that may be impo~ed by th~
North CaroHna State Bar Should not be taken by you to indicate t.ha't .arty .
metnber of the 'committee feels that your copduC1: was excusable Or les,s ·than ~
serious and substantial vi<;llation of the Rules of Professional COil4act and the
law of the S ta'ce of North Carolina.

. i t is now my duty to issue this Public Censure.

I

In April, 1987, you undertook to re'present James Le<iwell, Jr. on a
tra.ffic violation in which Mr. Ledwell had ·entered a plea in Mon~gomery COUilty
District Court. Ledwell was a school bus driver and faced the. poss'ib:I:l:tty of
losing that privilege is convic-ted of the offense. On dllUe ~lj 1981, a-fter
Ledwell had graduated from high school and no longer .drove a school, bUl3, you
were i~ Montgomery County Superior Court to enter a plea in the traffic
offense on Ledwell's behalf after the Assistant District Attorney ha~ag:t;'eed
to accept a plea to a lesser charge. Ledwell was not present in court;.
Judge Russell G. Walker, Jr. was presiding in the courtroom:, and asked
you if you had filed a waiver or appearance signed by your~c1ient which was
necessary for the court to proceed in his absence. You 'advie?edthe coqrt that

one had not been filed but that you had one available wi,th other papers you,
had outside the courtroom. After being asked by the judge to deliver the
waiver to the clerk, you left the courtrOom. You returned shortly and advised
the co.urt that you did not have the waiver with you a,nd that it must be in
your office. ·After asking the court to continue the ca$c, you went to your
office to get the waiver upon being instructed by the judge to do so when he
denied your request for a continuance.

Upon returning to tlle courtroom, you handed the judge a waiver form
purportedly s:J.gned by James Ledwell, Jr. However, the waiver had not in fact
been signed by Ledwell, your having prepared and signed i t in your abscence
from the courtroom.
Your preparation of this document and presenting it to Judge Russeli G.
Walker, Jr. as t40ugh,.it: had been signed by James Ledwell, Jr. was a
misr~p~esentat:J.(m to th~ court.
It violated Rule 1.2(C) of the Rules of
Ptofessional Conduct. In deciding not to send this matter to the Disciplinary
Hearing Commission for the poss'ible imposition of more severe discipline, the
commi·ttee was cognizant of your having your client's consent to dispose of the
offense in the manner proposed by you and the Assistant District Attorney,
your sincere belief that you had gotten Ledwell to sign a waiver but simply
couldn't find it, the fact that this was not· done for any personal gain, the
lack of prejudice to the administration of jus·tice as a result of your action,
and the likelihood that such conduct will not be repeated in the fut;ure.
The ~ommittee is conffdent
you, that it will be remembered
you. The committee is confident
depart from strict adherence to

that this Public Censure will be heeded by
by you, and that it will he beneficial to
that you will never again allow yourself to
the highest st.andards of the profe·ssion.

.
Pursuant to SectioQ, 2~ of Article IX of the Rules and Regulations of the
NOrth Carolina State Bar, it is ordered that a certified copy of this Public .
Censure be for.warded to the Superior COurt of Montgomery Couty for entry upon
the judgment docket and to the Supreme Court of North Carolina for entry in

policy adopted by the, Council of the North Carolina State Bar on the taxing of.
costs in cases where discipline is ordered by the Grievance Committee, you are
hereby taxed Fifty ($50.00) as. the administrative costs in this action •
