The findings of fact in paragraphs 1 - 38 above are reincorporated as if set faIth

herein.

2.
The legal profession is entrusted with the privilege of self-regulation. When an
attorney fails to participate in the profession's self-regulation by failing to respond to the
inquiries of the State Bar, this interferes with the State Bar's ability to regulate attorneys and
undermines the privilege of lawyers in this State to remain self-regulating.
3.
A keystone of the public's trust in the legal profession is the proper management
by attorneys of attorney trust accounts. The ability and willingness of attorneys to demonstrate
that proper management to the Stale Bar fosters public confidence and facilitates the State Bar's
regulation of the profession for the protection of the public.
4.

Defendant maintained client ledgers for his trust account

5.
Although not as frequently as required, Defendant engaged in review of his tJust
account records in the course of maintaining entrusted funds.
6.

There is no evidence of any dishonest motive on the part of Defendant.

7.
Prior to the revision of Rule 1.15-3(d)(1) effective September 30, 2016,
Defendant's reconciliation process was sufficient to meet the requirements of the quarterly
reconciliation previously in effect, if timely done.
8.
Defendant has begun maintaining a general ledger for his trust account and
conducting reconciliations in which he compares his bank balance, general ledger balance, and
client ledger balance total.
9.
With the addition of the maintenance of a general ledger and the incorporation of
comparison of the general ledger balance with the client ledger balance and the adjusted bank
balance in his reconciliations, Defendant's current reconciliation process is compliant with the
current version of Rule I.I5-3( d)( 1).
10.
Defendant has acknowledged that his failures to respond to the State Bar's
inquiries greatly exacerbated this matter. Defendant is taking steps to address the underlying
physical and mental health concerns that impacted his responsiveness to the State Bar.
Defendant has established procedures to ensure his prompt receipt of and response to State Bar
communications.
11.
Defendant has been practicing law for over 40 years and has established a
reputation for good character.
12.

Defendant has no prior discipline.

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following

2.
Defendant's failures to adequately or timely respond to the State Bar caused
potential significant harm to the profession and its self-regulation.
3.

There is no evidence of actual harm caused by Defendant's conduct.

4.

The Healing Panel considered all of the disciplinary options available to it. In the
course of this consideration, the Hearing Panel carefully considered the factor that could be
considered in imposing a suspension or stayed suspension. In light of all of the evidence, the
Hearing Panel concluded a reprimand is a more appropriate discipline.

5.
The Hearing Panel considered all lesser sanctions and concluded that discipline
ShOl1 of reprimand would not adequately protect the public. Imposition of a lesser discipline
would fail to acknow ledge the seriousness of the offenses Defendant committed and would send
the wrong message to members of the Bar and the public regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar of this State.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and additional Findings of
Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel hereby enters the
following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

Secretary.
