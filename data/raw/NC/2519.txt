REPRIMAND

On October 20,2005 the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar met and
considered the grievanceS filed against you by the North Carolina State Bar.
Pursuant to Section .0113(a) of the Discipline and Disability Rules of the No~h Carolina
State Bar, the Grievance Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the
information available to it, including your response to the letter of notice, the Grievance
Committee found probable'cause. Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable cause to
believe that a member of the North Carolina State Baris guilty ofmisconductjustitying
disciplin.ary action."
.

The rules provide that after a fmding of probable cause, the Grievance Committee may
cletermine that the filing of a complaint and a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing
,
Commission are not required, and the Grievance Committee may issue various levels ~f
discipline depending upon the misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any
aggravating or mitigating factors. The Grievance Committee may issue an admonition, a
reprimand, ,or a cenSure to the respondent attorney.
A reprimand is a written form of discipline more serious than an admonition issued in
cases in which an attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional
Conduct and has caused harm or potential harm to a client, the administration of justice, the
profession, or a member of the public, but the misconduct does not require a censure.

The Grievance Committee was of the opinion that a censure is not required in this case
and issues this reprimand to you. As chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North
Carolina State Bar, it is now my duty to ,issue this reprimand, and 1 am certain that you will
understand fully the spirit in which this duty is performed.
In 2003 you represented A.T. in District Court for a DWI. Because of a mix,.u,.p in court
dates, you were unable to dispose of Mr. T.'S case the last time you and he were in court and the
case had to be continued. However, you failed to con;firm a new court date and an order fOF Mr.
T.'s arrest was issued by the court. You did not take appropriate steps to protect Mr. T.'s
