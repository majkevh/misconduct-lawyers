FINDINGS OF FACT
1.
Plaintiff, the NOlth Carolina State Bar ("State Bm'''), is a body duly
organized under the laws of NOlth Carolina and is the proper party to this proceeding
under the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of NOlth Carolina,
and the Rules and Regillations of the NOlth Carolina State Bar (Chapter 1 of Title 27 of
the NOlth Carolina Administrative Code).
2.
Defendant, R. Kelly Calloway, J1'. ("Calloway" 01' "Defendant"), was
admitted to the NOlth Carolina State Bar on August 20, 1993, and is, and was at all times
refe11'ed to herein, an attorney at law licensed to practice in NOlth Carolina, subject to thelaws of the State of NOlth Carolina, the Rules and Regulations of the NOlth Carolina
State Bar, and the Rules of Professional Conduct.

3.
During all or patt of the relevant periods referred to herein, Calloway was
engaged in the practice of law in Hendersonville, Henderson Connty, North Carolina,
doing legal business as Calloway & Associates Law Firm, P.C. ("film").
4.
In addition to Calloway himself, the finn paid wages to one or more
employees between the first quatter of 2006 through the first quatter of 2012 ("the
relevatlt time period").
5.
Calloway had signature authority on all bank accounts maintained by his
film at SnnTrust Banlc in Hendersonville, North Cmolina.
6.
Calloway signed the checks with which the firm paid bi-weekly wages to
its employees.
7.
During the relevatlt time period, Calloway controlled the funds in all bank
accounts maintained by the finn atld made decisions regarding how and when such funds
in those acconnts would be deposited andlor disbursed.
8.
When the firm paid its employees during the relevatlt time period,
Calloway would withhold the appropriate funds ji-om the employees' paychecks to pay
federal income, Social Security and Medicare taxes to the Intemal Revenue Service
("IRS") atld state income. taxes to the North Cat'olina Depattment of Revenue, and would
pay his employee(s) and himself the net amounts due.
9.
During the relevatlt time period, the withheld funds remained in the film's
operating account and were not paid by Calloway to the IRS.
10.
Calloway understood that from the time the funds were withheld from
employees' paychecks until the funds were ultimately to be paid to the IRS, he atld the
firm had a fiduciary obligation to hold the funds in trust for the benefit of the IRS.
11.
For tax years 2006 through 2012, Calloway provided the film's employees
with W-2 fonns.
12.
The W-2 forms Calloway provided to his employees included the total
compensation paid, atld separately listed the social security, Medicare, federal income
taxes, atld state income taxes withheld ii'om his employees' paychecks.
13.
Calloway provided the W-2 forms to his employees in January or
February of the year immediately following the previous tax yeat· (i.e., Calloway
provided the W-2 forms for 2006 in January or February of 2007), atld therefore
Calloway knew the amounts he was supposed to be withholding for his employees and
paying to the appropriate federal and state government agencies.
14.
During the relevant time period, Calloway used the federal withholding
funds in his operating account to continue to pay income to himself, his employees'
wages, atld the film's other expenses, including his membership at the Hendersonville
-2-

Country Club ($2,643.02 in 2008; $3,163.05 in 2009; $1,997.18 in 2010; and, $3,670.19

$10,769.22 in 2012.
16.
Calloway and his film failed to timely file Federal QUaJieriy Tax Returns
and annual federal tax returns for the firm for all quarters from 2006 to the third quarter
of2011.
17.
Beginning in Februmy 2012, Calloway voluntarily filed the past due 941

Calloway failed to pay for all qUaliers of 2006 to the third qumer of 2011 was
$70,896.68.
19.
After adding penalties and interest, the IRS filed Federal Tax Lien Notices
("liens") in 2012 against Calloway and his film indicating that the film owed the IRS
approximately $123,476.12 in employee payroll withholding taxes, interest, and penalties
for the relevant time period.

3.
In February 2012, on his own initiative, Defendant began taking corrective
action and filed the federal tax retul11S he failed to file during the relevant time period.
4.
Defendant's yearly income during the relevant time period ranged £i'om a
low of $10,769.22 in 2012 to a high of $31,153.95 in 2009 and 2010, and there is no
evidence that he used the fiduciary withholding funds to maintain a lavish lifestyle.
5.
From January 2012 to October 2012, Defendant made payments to the IRS
of over $14,000 towards the liens owed.
6.
Between December 2012 and August 2013, the IRS garnished more than
$17,000 from Defendant's bank accOlmt toward satisfYing its liens.
7.
In August 2013, Defendant reached agreement with IRS to pay $1,533.62

II.
After initially failing to submit timely responses during the grievance
process, Defendant thereafter cooperated with the State Bar's investigation and has been
responsive to subsequent State Bar's inquiries.
12.
Defendant was diagnosed with hyperglycemia in 2006, which contributed
to his feelings of being overwhelmed in his personal and professional lives.

14.
Defendant experienced marital difficulties and separated from his wife in
November of2013 during the time period his response was due to the State Bar's Letter
of Notice in Grievance File No. 13G0917, and such circumstances contributed to his
inattention to submit a timely response.

Defendant has expressed remorse for his inattention to his federal and
state tax obligations and his failure to timely respond to the State Bar's Letter of Notice
in Grievance File No. 13G0917.

Based on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO DISCIPLINE

I.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fonns of
discipline available to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. lB §.0114(w)(l) of the Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and concludes the following factors warrant suspension of
Defendant's license:
(C)

Circumstances reflecting the Defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness,
or integrity; and,

(E)

Defendant's actions potentially had a negative impact on the public's
perception of the legal profession.

2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27N.C.A.C. lB §.0114(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors are present, but did not walTant disbatment in
light of the' totality ofthe evidence in this case:
(A)

Acts of misrepresentation;

(C)

Defendant's conversion of assets to which he was not entitled; and,

(D)

Commission of a felony.

3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enwnerated in
27 N.C.A.C. lB §.0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the NOlth Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(A)

Defendant's recent prior disciplinary offense;

(D)

Defendant eventually made good faith efforts to rectify consequences of
misconduct;

(G)

Defendant engaged in multiple offenses;

(H)

Effect of any personal or emotional problems on the conduct in question;

(K)

Defendant's full and fi'ee disclosure to the hearing panel and cooperative
attitude towat'd the proceedings;

(P)

Defendant's remorse and efforts to repay all sums unpaid to State and
Federal authorities; and,

(S)

Defendant's degree of experience in the practice oflaw

-7-

4.
The Hearing Panel has considered issuing an admonition, reprimand or
censure but concludes that such discipline would not be sufficient discipline because of
the gravity of the misconduct at issue and the halm or potential harm Defendant's
misconduct caused to the public, the administration of justice, and the legal profession.
5.
For these reasons, this Hearing Panel finds that an order imposing
discipline short of suspension of Defendant's law license would not adequately protect
the public, the legal profession, or the administration of justice for the following reasons:
a) The factors under 27 N.C.A.C. 1B §.0114(w)(1) and (w)(3) that are
established by the evidence are of a nature that suppmi imposition of
suspension as the appropriate discipline; and,
b) Entry of less serious discipline would fail to acknowledge the seriousness
of the offenses Defendant committed and would send the wrong message
to prosecutors, attomeys, and the public regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar in this State.
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law and the findings
, of fact and conclusion regarding discipline, and based upon the consent of the parties, the
Hearing Panel enters the following:
