ANNETTE H. EXUM, Attorney,
Defendant

THIS MATTER came on to be heard and was heard on 4 March 2011 before a
hearing panel of the Disciplinary Hearing Commission composed of J. Michael Booe,
Chair, Robert F. Siler and Michael Houser. Brian P.D. Oten represented the North
Carolina State Bar. Dudley A. Witt represented Defendant, Annctte H. Exurn. Based
upon the pleadings and evidence presented at trial, the hearing panel hereby enters the
following
FINDINGS OF FACT
I.
Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar ("Plaintiff" or "State Bar"), is a
body duly organized wlder the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this
proceeding Wlder the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North
Carolina, and the niles and regulations of the North Carolina State Bar promulgated
thereWlder.
2.
Defendant, Annette H. Exurn ("Exum" or "Defendant"), was admitted to
the North Carolina State Bar on 4 April 2003 and is, and was at all times rcferred to
herein, an Attorney at Law licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the rules,
regulations, and Rules of Professional Conduct of the North Carolina State Bar and the
laws of the State of North Carolina.
3.
During the tinJes relevant hereto, Defendant was actively engaged in the
practice of law in the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office in Raleigh,
Wake COWlty, North Carolina.
4.
Plaintiff filed the complaint in this action on 15 January 2010 and
amended its complaint on 6 December 2010. Defendant was properly served with
process and received due notice of the hearing in this matter.
5.
By motion dated 31 January 2011, Defendant raised the issue of her
disability in the Wlderlying disciplinary proceeding.

6.
On 7 February 201 I, the Chair of the Disciplinary Hearing Panel stayed
the underlying disciplinary proceeding, transferred Defendant to disability inactive status,
set a hearing date of 4 March 20 II to determine whether Defendant is disabled and
appointed counsel to represent Defendant in the 4 March 20 II hearing on disability
pursuant to 27 N.C. Admin. Code IB ยง .0118(c).
7.
On 4 March 2011, Defendant was an inpatient at Wake Medical Center
under the care of her cardiologist, Robert Wesley, n, M.D., FA.C.C. ("Dr. Wesley"),
who has treated Defendant since 2007. At the time of the hearing, a cardiac
catheterization was being performed to define her coronary artery anatomy with
simultaneous stint implantation if required, thereby preventing Defendant from attending
the 4 March 2011 hearing. Counsel for Defendant stipulated in open court that
Defendant wished and instructed her counsel to proceed with the 4 March 2011 disability
hearing dcspite hcr absence.
8.
Defendant began experiencing significant health issues requiring inpatient
treatment and admission to Wake Med as early as March 2006. During this period of
inpatient hospitalization, Defendant advised her treating physicians that she was
experiencing light headedness, stuttering and slurred speech, that she felt unsteady on her
feet with an abnormal gait, and that she felt weak and anxious. At some point after her
discharge from Wake Med in March 2006, Dr. Wesley began treating Defendant for
evaluation of hypertension, chest pain and shortness of breath. Defendant was again
hospitalized under Dr. Wesley's care at Wake Med in 2008 with symptoms of dizziness
and stuttering speech. After a thorough work up it was determined that her episodes were
"not particularly consistent with transient ischemic attacks (mini strokes)." She was once
again hospitalized under Dr. Wesley's care at Wake Med in 2010 for weakness and
slurred speech. Defendant was again hospitalized in January 2011 after experiencing an
episode of dizziness and weakness at the courthouse during which she lowered herself to
the ground.
9.
Based upon his cardiovascular and neurology evaluations of Defendant
over the preceding four years, Dr. Wesley diagnosed Defendant with neurocardiogenic
presyncope due to hypertensive heart disease. In Dr. Wesley's opinion, this condition is
exacerbated by acute and chronic emotional stress. Dr. Wesley explained that
neurocardiogenic presyncope is a cardiovascular condition which develops in the setting
of decreased blood volume in the left ventricle, which is the main pumping chamber of
the heart. A chronic state of decreased blood level leads to stimulation of stretch
receptors in the heart muscle, which activate an epinephrine-mediated cardiovascular
reflux which leads to enlargement of the veins in the leg. Venous enlargement leads to
pooling ofa large amount of blood in the lower extremities, which reduces the amount of
blood returning to the heart. The ultimate effect is less blood flows from the heart to the
brain which leads to neurological symptoms including dizziness and wealmess.
10.
In Dr. Wesley's opinion, chronic stress combined with acute stressors,
including the recent death of her father and the everyday life/practice of an attorney,
cause Defendant to experience recurrent symptoms which impact her on a daily basis.
Defendant's chronic hypertension combined with her chronic strcss cause her symptoms

to be especially debilitating. Dr. Wesley concluded that Defendant currently suffers from
a physical disability that impairs her professional performance as an attorney.
I I.
Dr. Wesley recommended a course of treatment consisting of a referral to
cardiac rehabilitation for supervised exercise sessions to allow the Defendant to improve
cardiovascular conditioning, lose weight, retrain her cardiovascular system to maintain an
appropriate blood pressure response to upright posture and improve blood pressure
response to stress. He also indicated that treatment should include careful monitoring of
medications and using beta blocker therapy to antagonize the epinephrine-mediated
cardiovascular reflex which causes neurocardiogenic presyncope. By following the
prescribed cardiac rehabilitation, Dr. Wesley is hopeful that Defendant can improve to a
state that allows her to function without neurocardiogenic presyncope.
12.
Dr. G. Lane Wagaman, Ed.D, Licensed Psychologist ("Dr. Wagaman"),
began treating Defendant in December, 2010. Dr. Wagaman testified that Defendant's
general anxiety is presently at such a high level that it impairs her professional judgment
and performance as an attorney. Defendant's anxiety and response to acute stressors
combined with Dr. Wagaman's limited clinical observations and inability to review
medical records outlining Defendant's prior medical history prohibited Dr. Wagaman
from conducting a complete psychological examination of Defendant and forming an
opinion as to a formal diagnosis of Defendant's psychological condition. However, Dr.
Wagaman through his clinical observation has been able to form a working diagnosis that
Defendant suffers from an adjustment disorder of unspecified origin that significantly
impairs Defendant's judgment and performance as an attorney and which impairs her
ability to practice law.
13.
Dr. Wagaman recommends the following course of treatment for
Defendant: First, attempting to control Defendant's high level of anxiety by referring
Defendant to a psychiatrist to determine what, if any, medications may be helpful in
reducing, eliminating, or better controlling the Defendant's current significant levels of
anxiety and reaction to acute stress because such reaction presently impairs Dr.
Wagaman's ability to properly evaluate and determine Defendant's psychological
condition. Once Defendant regains control of her anxiety, Dr. Wagaman recommends
Defendant submit to a full psychological examination to determine if Defendant suffers
from any additional or alternative psychological condition(s) and produce a final,
definitive diagnostic impression and consequent treatment.
Dr. Wagaman's
recommended course of treatment would also include referral for a complete medical
work up on Defendant's physical condition, if after reviewing Defendant's previous
medical records said referral is necessary to determine what, if any, physical
characteristics contribute to Defendant's psychological condition.
14.
Defendant's pattern of behavior reflects an ongoing inability to carry out
her professional responsibilities based upon her neurocardiogenic presyncope due to
hypertensive heart disease, exacerbated by acute chronic stress, chronic anxiety, and
potentially other undiagnosed psychological conditions.

15.
In order to protect the public, it is necessary for Defendant to identify and
obtain appropriate treatment for the mental and physical conditions that have rendered
her unable to fulfill her professional responsibilities.
16.
The parties, through counsel, informed the panel that an additional
amendment to the complaint will be necessary to include an additional claim for relief.
Counsel for both parties stipulated in open court that they consented to an Order being
entered allowing this amendment. Counsel for the parties further stipulate that the time
to answer the allegations of the amended complaint would be stayed until Defendant is
reinstated to active status.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the hearing panel enters the following
