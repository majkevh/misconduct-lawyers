FAILURE TO PRODUCE TRUST ACCOUNT DOCUMENTS

4.
Defendant maintained a general attorney trust account with BB&T Banle, account
number last four digits 1977 ("TA 1977").
5.

On August 21, 2013, the State Bar conducted a random procedural audit of TA

1977.
6.
The audit revealed that Defendant had failed to reconcile his trust account on a
qUalierly basis, and that TA 1977 contained approximately $2,500.00 in funds for which
Defendant could not identify the beneficial owner/client.
7.
Defendant admitted to the State Bar's auditor that he had not reconciled TA 1977
bank statements and his trust account for "quite some time."
8.
As a result of violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct observed during the
procedural audit, the Grievance Committee opened grievance file no. 13G 1130.
9.
In its investigation of file no. 13G 1130, on April 9, 2014, the Grievance
Committee sent Defendant a letter asking Defendant to produce the following documents of TA
1977 for the period January 2011 to present: 1) all trust account statements; 2) all trust account
reconciliations (monthly and quarterly); 3) all deposit tickets; 4) all canceled checks; 5) all
client ledgers for clients on whose behalf Defendant held funds in his trust account; and 6) all
deposit items (collectively "requested documents").
10.
On April 25, 2014, Defendant responded in writing to the April 9 letter. In his
response, Defendant admitted that he had not reconciled TA 1977 on a monthly basis, and that he
had not escheated approximately $2,000.00 from TA 1977 because he was still trying to identify
the owner(s) of the entrusted funds.
11.
Defendant's letter further advised the State Bar that he had made arrangements
with a CPA to help Defendant identify the beneficial owner( s) of the funds in his trust account
and to prepare reconciliations in the future.
12.
Defendant did not produce the requested documents with his April 25, 2014 letter,
but stated that the information would be forwarded to the State Bar shOlily.
13.
Defendant is required by Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15-3(g) to maintain the
documents requested by the Grievance Committee for a minimum of six years.
14.
On June 12,2014, the Grievance Committee sent a letter to Defendant reminding
him that the requested documents had not been received and asked him to produce them by June
25,2014. Defendant did not produce the requested documents in response to the June 12 letter.

15.
On February 25, 2015, the Grievance Committee sent an email to Defendant that
referenced its June 12 letter and a February 23,2015 voice message about his failure to produce
the requested documents. Notwithstanding these reminders, Defendant did not produce the
requested documents.
16.
On March 4, 2015, the Chair of the Grievance Committee issued a subpoena
commanding Defendant to appear at the State Bar on March 16, 2015 and to produce the
requested documents.
17.
The subpoena was sent to Defendant by celiified mail at his address on file with
the State Bar's Membership Depmiment.
18.

Defendant did not accept the celiified mail containing the subpoena.

19.
On March 16, 2015, a deputy counsel in the State Bar's Office of Counsel
contacted Defendant about the requested documents and Defendant agreed to accept service of
the subpoena by email.
20.

Defendant's time to respond to the subpoena was extended to March 23,2015.

21.

Defendant did not produce the requested documents by March 23,2015.

22.
On April 1, 2015, the State Bar filed a motion for a temporary restraining order
and a petition for a preliminary injunction in Wake County Superior Court based on Defendant's
failure to produce the requested documents in response to the State Bar's subpoena.
23.
On April 2, 2015, Defendant consented to an order of preliminary injunction that
enjoined Defendant from accepting trust funds from clients or initiating any transactions on TA
1977 until authorized to do so by the cOUli.
24.
The preliminary injunction further ordered Defendant to produce the requested
documents and authorized the State Bar to obtain TA 1977 documents from BB&T.
25.
On April 14,2015, Defendant produced documents related to TA 1977 including
bank statements, canceled checks, a handwritten check register and copies of handwritten client
ledgers for the time period of January 2011 through March 2015.
26.

Most of the bank statements Defendant produced were incomplete.

Page 3 of15

29.
On October 28, 2015, Woods emailed Defendant requesting copies of 48 client
ledgers and the identification of 82 transactions that could not be attributed to clients using the
information previously provided to the State Bar by Defendant. Woods also asked Defendant
questions about the transactions in TA 1977.
30.
On November 5, 2015, Diana Baum ("Baum"), an assistant to Defendant, emailed
Woods a spreadsheet listing transactions that occurred in 2013, 2014 and 2015, but did not
answer the questions in Woods' October 28,2015 email.
On December 8, 2015, Woods contacted Defendant by phone and asked for a
31.
response to Woods' October 28, 2015 email. Defendant stated that he thought the response had
been sent and that he would check with Baum.
On December 18, 2015, Defendant sent Woods an email stating that Baum would
32.
send the information the following Monday, December 21,2015. On December 22,2015, Baum
sent Woods copies of 11 client ledgers that Defendant's office had previously provided on April
14,2015.
On March 21,2016, the Chair of the Grievance Committee issued a subpoena for
33.
the Defendant to appear in person on April 21, 2016 for examination and production of
documents. The subpoena was sent to Defendant by certified mail but Defendant did not accept
the celiified mail.
On July 29, 2016, Defendant accepted service of a reissued subpoena that
34.
commanded him to appear at the State Bar on August 12, 2016 for examination and production
of documents listed in the subpoena.
35.
Defendant appeared at the State Bar on August 12, 2016 with most of the
subpoenaed documents and was questioned by a deputy counsel.
36.
Defendant did not produce monthly or qualierly trust account reconciliations of
TA 1977 in response to the requests of the State Bar.
37.
Client ledgers that Defendant produced did not always contain running balances
and most of the ledgers did not contain ending balances.
38.
Woods identified $15,527.00 in the trust account as of January 1,2011 for whom
she could not determine the beneficial owners because the documents produced by Defendant
were inadequate.
39.

Woods asked Defendant for additional client ledgers dated prior to January 2011.

40.
In September 2016, Defendant's office produced 15 client ledgers dated between
2007 and 2010.
41.
The ledgers reflected that Defendant was required on January 1, 2011 to be
holding in trust a total of $15,611. 81.

clear, cogent and convincing evidence enters the following:

Page 8 of15

FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
since 1984.

Defendant has substantial experience in the practice of law having been licensed

2.
Defendant's failure to timely respond to requests for trust account records and his
failure to accept and timely respond to subpoenas for trust account records caused the State Bar
to petition the Superior COUli to enjoin Defendant's handling of entrusted funds, demonstrating
Defendant's disregard for the legal profession's self-regulation process.
3.
Defendant's violation of multiple rules related to proper administration of his trust
accounts has the potential to cause significant harm to the standing of the profession in the eyes
of the public because it shows his disregard for his duties as an attorney. Defendant's conduct
undermines the public's confidence in lawyers' ability to safely maintain and account for
entrusted client funds.
4.
Defendant's failure to conduct quarterly reconciliations and failure to otherwise
monitor his trust accounts has the potential to cause harm to his clients. Conducting qUalierly
reconciliations of trust accounts is vital to proper maintenance and protection of entrusted funds.
Defendant's continued failure to perform monthly and quarterly reconciliations and his failure to
maintain proper trust account records demonstrate Defendant's intent to commit acts where the
potential harm was foreseeable.
5.
There is no evidence that Defendant took any money from client accounts for his
own personal gain.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Findings of Fact
Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following:

CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of discipline
available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure and suspension. In addition, the
Hearing Panel has considered all factors contained in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B § .0116(£)(1) of the Rules
and Regulations of the State Bar and finds that the following factors warrant suspension of
Defendant's license:
(a) Intent of the defendant to commit acts where the potential harm is foreseeable;
(b) Negative impact of the defendant's actions on the public's perception of the
profession; and
(c) Multiple instances of failure to patiicipate in the legal profession's self-regulation
process.

2.
The Hearing Panel has also considered all factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB
§ .0116(f)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the N01ih Carolina State Bar and concludes that no
factors are established to warrant consideration of disbarment.
3.
The Hearing Panel has also considered all factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B
§ .0116(f)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the N01ih Carolina State Bar and concludes the
following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a)

failure to make timely good faith eff01is to rectify the consequences of
Defendant's misconduct;

(b)

pattern of misconduct;

(c)

multiple offenses; and

(d)

experience in the practice of law.

4.
Defendant's misconduct resulted in potential significant harm to his clients by
placing entrusted client funds at risk of misapplication.
5.
Defendant's misconduct had a negative impact on the public's perception of the
legal profession.
6.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and finds that a censure,
reprimand or admonition would be insufficient discipline because of the harm and potential
significant harm to Defendant's clients and the negative impact of Defendant's actions on the
public's perception of the profession.
7.
The Hearing Panel finds that discipline Sh01i of suspension would not adequately
protect the public, would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the misconduct and would send
the wrong message to attorneys and the public about the conduct expected of members of the Bar
of this State.
8.
The Hearing Panel finds and concludes that the public will be adequately
protected by suspension of Defendant's law license with the 0PP01iunity for a stay upon
compliance with conditions imposed upon Defendant designed to ensure protection of the public
and Defendant's continued compliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Findings of Fact
Regarding Discipline and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel hereby
enters the following:
