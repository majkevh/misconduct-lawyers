CONCLUSIONS OF LAW,
AND ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

Frantz, pursuant to Section .0114 of the Discipline and Disability Rules of the
NQrth Carolina State Bar (hereinafter "Bar Rules") on September 2-3, 1998. The
D~fendant, David M. Godwin, was represented by Bruce H. Jackson, Jr. The

and the evidence presented, the hearing committee hereby enters the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT

th~ authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the Gener~1 Statutes of North Catolina,
and the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar promulgated

3. During the times relevant to this complaint, Godwin actively engaged in
the practice of law in the State of North Carolina and maintaine9 a law office in
the city of Wilmington, New Hanover County, North Carolina.

4. Since at least November 1994 and at all times relevant to this

I

complaint, Godwin has maintained a trust account at First Citizens Bank and
Trust Company (formerly Peoples Federal Savings Bank, hereinafter collectively
referred to as "First Citizens), account number 112304, in which all client or
fiduciary funds handled by Godwin were supposed to be held in trust (hereinafter
"trust account").
5. At all times relevant to this .complaint, Godwin also maintained the
following two accounts from which GodWin generally met his law firm's operating
or business expenses: (1) account number 112312 at FirSt Citizens, out of
which general business expenses, other than payroll~ generally were paid
(hereinafter "operating account"); and (2) account number 142251 at First
Citizens, out of which payroll expenses for Godwin's employees generally were
paid (hereinafter "payroll account").
Trust Account Violations

6. Beginning on April 30, 1995, Godwin had insufficient funds in his trust
account to cover all the money he was supposed to be holding in trust for aU' his
clients.
.
7. From April 30, 1995 until April 30, 1997, when the State Bar enjoined
him from handling client funds (hereinafter "defalcation period"), Godwin never
had sufficient funds in his trust account to cover all the money he was supposed
to be holding in trust for all his clients.
8. During this entire two year defalcation period', Godwin never reconciled
his trust account balances of funds belonging to all clients.

9. On at least six different occasions during the defalcation period,
checks made payable to Godwin were issued out of Godwin's trust account ~nd
deposited into either Godwin's oper~ting or payroll account.

10. Specifically, the following checks were drawn from Godwin's trust
account and made payable to Godwin in the following amounts:

(1) On December 11, 1995, check number 2278 for $1,000;
(2) On December 21,1995, check number 2283 for $170;
(3) On February 1, 1996, check number 2287 for $500;
(4) On February 8, 1996, check number 2288 for $400;
(5) On July 3, 1996, check number 2303 for $200; and

~ ~
,

~

100496

\

(6) On November 1, 1996, check number 2205 for $300.
11. These six checks did not represent fees to which Godwin was
entitled. Moreover, Godwin did not have permission to use any part of the funds
held in trust for .the benefit of himself or any third party, otlier than his clients.

12. In all six instances, the funds from Godwin's trust account were used
to pay Godwin's law firm operating and business expenses, including Godwin's
payroll.

13. At the time these six checks were withdrawn from Godwin's trust

I

account and deposited into his operating or payroll account, Godwin had
insufficient funds in the respective operating or payroll account to pay his or his
law firm's bills or obligations out of the funds in those accounts.

14. Additionally, on April 19, 1996, check number 2295 was issued from
the trust account made payable to Ryan Broussard in the amount of $1,323.49.
15. At the time check number 2295 was issued, the balance in the trust
account was $75.80. First Citizens honored the check but issued a NSF notice
to Godwin's office and included a NSF charge on Godwin's next bank statement
for :his trust account.

16. After check number 2295 was issued to Broussard and the NSF
charge was made, the balance of Godwin's trust accol,Jnt was -$1,269.69.
17. On April 24, 1996, a check was issued from Godwin's operating
acqount and deposited into his trust account in the amount of $'1,270. The check
from Godwin's operating account was issued after the Broussard check to
rei'11burse the trust account and to return the account to a positive balance.
18. On April 25, 1996, First Citizens dishonored the $1,270 check from

I

Godwin's operating account.

19. On April 30, 1996, the $1,270 check from Godwin's operating account
was resubmitted to First Citizens for deposit into the trust account and honored.

20. At the time the Broussard check was presented for payment to First
Citizens, Godwin did not have on file with First Citizens a directive requiring First
Citizens to report to the North Carolina State Bar when any check drawn on his
trust account was presented for payment against insufficient funds.

21. All of the above-mentioned checks issued from and deposits. into
Godwin's trust, operating or payroll accounts were done by Godwin's legal
assistant, (hereafter referred to as "LA").

3

I

22. Godwin employed LA as a legal assistant in his office beginning in
July 1995. LA was employed by Godwin until August 1997.
23'. Shortly after he hired her, Godwin authorized LA to issue and sign
checks on and make deposits into his trust, operating and payroll accounts.

24. During the period in which Godwin gave LA authority to issue and

I

sign checks on and make deposits into his trust, operating and payroll accounts,
Godwin failed to make reasonable efforts to ensure that his law firm had in effect
measures that would provide reasonable assurance that LA's actions were
compatible with his professional responsibilities and obligations.
Burton Matter

25. Billy E. Burton (hereinafter "Burton") retained Godwin in
approximately December 1995 to represent him on a personal injury matter.
26. On approximately July 11, 1996, Godwin received medical payments
in the amount of $2,613.87 from the opposing parties in Burton's personal injury
qlaim. These payments were made under a liability insurance contract providing
for the payment of Burton's medical expenses without regard to fault.

27. Godwin took a one-third fee from the medical payments in the amount
of $871.29, and disbursed the remainder, $1,742.58, to Burton.

I

28. On or about September 26, 1996, Godwin received a check for the
settlement of Burton's personal injury suit in the amount of $9,000. Godwin took
a one-thir.d fee of $3,000, retained $2,577 in his trust account to pay various oJ
Burton's medical expenses, and disbursed the remaining $3,423 to BUiton.
29. As of January 21, 1997, almost four months after settling Burton's
personal injury case, Godwin had not paid Burton's medical bills from the funds
he withheld from settlement.

30. Burton and his wife applied for a loan for a new vehicle on
approximately January 21, 1997, and discovered that the medical bills, which
Godwin was supposed to have paid, had not been paid and had been referred
as overdue accounts on the Burtons' credit report.

31. On the same day, Burton and his wife came to Godwin's office and
were informed by Godwin's employee, Dave Perry, that there were insufficient
funds in the trust account to pay Burton's medical bills.

4

I
00498

32. Godwin subsequently became involved in the conversation with
the Burtons. After the Burtons told Mr. Godwin that the medical bills had
not been paid and that Dave Perry had told them that there were
insufficient funds in the trust account to pay the medical bills, Godwin told
the Burtons that there were 'sufficient fUhds in the trust account to cover
Burton's medical expenses. In fact, there were not sufficient funds in the trust
account to cover Burton's medical expenses at the time of Godwin's
conversation with the Burtons.
33. As of January 21, 1997, the balance in the trust account waS
,$115.99. Consequently, at the time Godwin talked to the Burtons, he
reasonably should have known that there were not sufficient funds in the trust
account to pay Burton's medical bills.

I

34. As of January 21, 1997, the amount that Godwin should have been
holding in his trust account for all his clients was $4,073.21. Consequently, there
wa:s a defalcation in the trust account in the amount of $3,957.22 on that dat~.
35'. The primary reasons that there were insufficient funds in Godwin's
trust account to pay Burton's medical bills were: (a) the issuance of the six
specific checks from his trust account to his operating and payroll accounts by
his legal assistant LA, set forth in Count I above, and (b) LA's issuance of check
nu~ber 2208 from Godwin's trust account to a third party.
36. Specifically, on or about September 25, 1996, LA issued check
number 2208 on Godwin's trust account in the flrtlOunt of $2,000 and made
payable to Jay Khajanchi.
37. On September 25,1996, when check number 2208 was drawn on the
tm!:?t account, Godwin was not holding any funds ,in his trust account for Jay
Khajanchi. In fact Godwin was not holding any funds in his trust account for Jay
Khajanchi at any time during the two year defalcation period.

I

38. Consequently, the issuance of check number 2208 exacerbated an
already existing defalcation in the trust account.
39. As of September 25, 1996, the amount Godwin should have been
holding in the trust account fot existing clients Was $10,298.88. After check
number 2208 was drawn, the balance of the account was $6,770.66. Thus, the
defalcation in the account after Check number 2208 was drawn on the account
on September 25, 1996 was -$3,528.22.
: 40. After Godwin became aware that Burton's medical bills had not
beer- paid, he paid Burton's medical providers from his own, funds.

5

I
00499

41. Godwin also reimbursed or made reasonable attempts to
reimburse all clients whose funds were misappropriated from his trust
account without his knowledge or direction.

Marlowe Closing

I

42. In 1997, Godwin agreed to conduct a closing of a refinancing loan for
a client, RQn Marlowe (hereafter "Marlowe").
43. In. connection with that closing, on or about March 13·,1997, Godwin
received from the lender, Branch Banking and Trust ("BB&T"), a cashier's check
in the amount of $64,900, representing the proceeds of the loan.
44. On or about March 26,1997, Godwin had Marlowe sign and execut~
the necessary documents for the loan closing (hereinafter "dry closing").
45. Godwin did not deposit the $64,900 cashier's check from BB&T into
his trust account until April 3, 1997.
46. As of April 30, 1997, Godwin had failed to

disbun~e

the proce~ds of

the loan to the appropriate parties.

47. As a result of Godwin's failure to disburse the loan proceeds by April
30, 1997, Marlowe's guaranteed loan rate expired and had to be re-negotiated

1

with BB&T, and a second loan closing had to be conducted by another attorney
on June 9,1997. As a result of the d~lay, Marlowe incurred additional charges
on the loan in the amount of $1,305.72.

48. Godwin paid $500 of the additiOnal interest charges at the time
of the second closing on June 9, 1997.
49. As early as February 1998, Godwin was aware that Marlowe 'had
for~gon~ an additional $805.72, that he should have received at the original
loan closing, but did not becaUse of the additional interest charges.
5Q. Godwin did pay the additional $805.72. However, Godwin did not
reimburse Mariowe for these funds, until 2 weeks before the l1earing in this
matter, on the advice of l1is attorney.

Representations to State Bar
51. After the State Bar's audit of Godwin's trust account, Godwin entered
into an agreement with the State Bar on March 21, 1997 ( hereinafter "March 21
Agreement"). Pursuant to the March 21 Agreement, Godwin, among other
things, was required to reimburse five clients for funds which he had received
from them in trust. The aggregate amount Godwin Was required to disburse to
all these clients was $1,087.
52. Godwin subsequently issued checks drawn on his trust account to
th~se clients. At the time Godwin issued these five checks out of the trust
aqcount, there were still insufficient funds in the trust account to cover the checkS
and Godwin's obligations to his other clients.

I

53. The State Bar subsequently requested information regarding whether
Godwin had reimbursed these five clients. After receiving information that
Godwin had issued checks to these five clients, the State Bar questioned why
Godwin issued the checks without depositing sufficient funds into the trust
account to cover these checks.
54. In response, Godwin told State Bar Investigator David J. Frederick
that a $641.61 deposit on March 21, 1997, identified on the trLlst account bank
statement, was a deposit Godwin made of his personal funds to cover a pbrtion
of those checks.
.
55. In fact, the $641.61 deposit represented funds of another client, C.A.
Joyce.
i
56. At the time Godwin represented to Investigator Frederick that the
$641.61 was a corrective deposit of his funds to cover the above-mentioned five
checks to clients, GOdwin had not made any corrective deposits to the trust
account to cover the five checks he issLied.

I

57. At that time, Godwin was the only signatory on all of his
accounts. If such a corrective deposit had been made, Godwin would have
had to issue the cheCk to be deposited into his trust account.
58. Thus, at the time he made the above-mentioned representations
to Investigator Frederick, Godwin knew that the $641.61 deposit was not a
cor,rective deposit.
59. Godwin knowingly and intentionally made a false
mi!~representation of material fact to Investigator Frederick in response to
an inquiry in a disCiplinary matter.

Conflict in Domestic Matter
60. In approximately July 1995, Godwin began representing Mrs. 8 in
domestic matters against her then-husband, Mr. 8.

I

61. On February 14,1996, Godwin, on behalf of Ms. 8, filed a complaint
against Mr. 8 in New Hanover County District Court. The complaint alleged
claims for relief for divorce from bed and board, equitable distribution and
alimony and sought post-separation support.
62. In November 1996, Godwin began dating Ms. 8.
f

63. In approximately January 1997, Godwin began a sexual relationship
with his client, Ms. 8.
64. As of January 1997, when Godwin began a sexual relationship with
Ms. 8, Ms. 8's claim for alimony against Mr. 8 was still outstanding.
65. Godwin continued to represent Ms. 8 on her outstanding claims for
alimony and unpaid post-separation support after he began a sexual relationship
with her. Godwin filed and responded to various motions in the matter and
appeared in court after he began a sexual relationship with Ms. 8.

66. On or about August 5, 1997, Godwin received a letter and proposed
motion to disquc;llify Godwin as counsel for Ms. 8 from Mr. 8's attorney.

I

67. The basis for the proposed motion to disqualify Godwihwas that
Godwin was having an ongoing sexual relationship with Ms'. 8 and that he would
likely be called as a witness to testify as to that relationship in the alimony trial. '
68. The letter stated that if Godwin did not agree to withdraw as Ms. 8's
counsel, the motion would be filed.
69. Mrs. 8's claim for alimony was on a triai calendar for the August
4, 1997 session of court.
70. Godwin signed and returned the letter agreeing to withdraw as
Mrs. 8's attorney and to continue Mrs. 8's alimony claim until another
session of court. Godwin had not withdrawn from representing Mrs. 8
previously.

71. The alimony trial subsequently was scheduled for October 21, 1997,
Prior to hearing the alimony matter, the court held a hearing on Ms. 8's separate
motion to show cause for Mr. 8's failure to pay post-separation 'support.

72. At the show cause hearing, both Godwin and Ms. B were called as
witnesses for Mr. B and were compelled to testify about the nature and extent of
their sexual relationship. Another attorney represented Ms. B at this hearing.

73. After the hearing on the show cause motion, in which Godwin and
Ms. B were compelled to testify about their sexual relationship, Ms. B dismissed
het alimony claim against Mr. B.
Post-Separation Support Claim

74. On April 19, 1996, following a he~ring, the presiding Judge ordered
Mr.
B
to
pay $250 per month in post-separation support to Ms. B.
,

I

75. Godwin was responsible for drafting the order for post-separation
support.

76. Godwin failed to have a final written order for post-separation support
entered until June 23, 1997, more than ~ year after the hearing.
77. Mr. B failed to pay post-separation support to Ms. B as ordered by the
cdurt.

78. Godwin, on behalf of Ms. B, was unsuccessful in enforcing and
coHecting the post-separation support payments from Mr. B until months after
G9dwin got the final written order for post-separation support entered on June
23',1997.
Eguitable Distribution Claim and Tax Proceeds

,

79. In approximately October 1995, Godwin received a check issued
jointly to Mr. and Ms. B in the amount of $734.52 from the North Carolina
Department of Revenue, which check represented a tax refund (hereinafter "tax
refund check").

I

80. Godwin deposited the tax refund check into his trust account.
81. Mr. and Ms. B disputed the ownership of tax refund check proceeds,
and these proceeds became one of the items that the court had to resolve in the
equitable distribution claim.

82. The equitable distribution claim was heard on October 11, 1996.
I
83. At the October 11, 1996 hearing on equitable distribution, the court ' .
ordered that the tax refund check proceeds be divided equally between and
distributed to Mr. and Ms. B.

9

I
00503

84. At the end of the hearing, the court directed Godwin to draft the
judgment of equitable distribution.
85. On several occasions thereafter, Mr. 8 reque$ted Godwin to draft the

equitable distribution judgment and disburse to him his sh~re of the tax refund
check proceeds.

I

86. Notwithstanding Mr. a's requests and the October 11, 1996 court
order, Godwin did not file the equitable distribution judgment and did not release
to Mr. B his half of the tax refund check proceeds. Godwin held Mr. 8's one half
of the tax refund check as long as he possibly could.
87. On February 7, 1997, Mr. 8 filed a pro se motion requesting the court
to order Godwin to file the equitable distribution judgment.

88. On February 10, 1997, the. court entered an order directing Godwin to
prepare and serve Mr. 8 with a proposed equitable distribution judgment not later
than February 14, 1997.

a9. Godwin failed to comply with the court's order to prepare and serve
the equitable distribution judgment by February 14, 1997.
90. On February 28, 1997, Mr. 8 filed another pro se motion to compel
Godwin to file the equitable distribution judgment and disburse to Mr. 8 his share
of the tax refund check proceeds. .

I

91. On March 18, 1997, OVer five months after the hearing on equitable
distribution and over one month after he had been order to file the order, Godwin
presented and filed a written judgment of equitable distribution in the 8 matter.
92 .. In a court order filed on June 23, 1997, the court found that Mr. 8
had been inconvenienced and incurred expenses as a result of Godwin's delay
in filing the equitable distribution order.

93. Accordingly, the court reduced the amount of post-separation support
Mr. 8 owed to Godwin's client, Ms. 8, by $250 as compensation to Mr. 8 for the
expense and inconvenience caused by Godwin's delay.

94. Prior to March 1997, the North Carolina State 8ar conducted an audit
of Godwin's trust account, in connection with its investigation of the matters set
forth in paragraphs 1-41.

10

00504

I

95. On March 21,1997, Godwin entered into an agreement with the
North Carolina State Bar which, among other things, required Godwin to
disburse to Mr. B his share of the tax refund check proceeds within 3 days.
96. Notwithstanding this agreement and the court's prior orders, Godwin
did not disburse to Mr. B his shar~ of the tax refund proceeds until
approximately April 21, 1997.
