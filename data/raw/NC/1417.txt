ATl'ORNEY AT LAW

This PUblic Censure iis delivered to you pursuant 'to §23 of the RUles of
Discipline and Disbarment of the North Carolina State Bar as ordered QY a
Hearing Committee of the :Disciplinary Hearing ComMission following the hearing
in the abOve-captioned pt:'oceeding on De,cember 14, 1984, in which the Hear'ing
Committee found that you had violated certain provisions of the Code of
Professional ResponsibiUty of ·the North Carolina ,State Bar.
,The fact that aPt.1b~ic Censure i$ not the rost serious discipline
provided for under N. C. [Gen. Stat. §84-28 and the Rules of the North Carolina
State B,ar should not be taken by you to ind4,catethat 'the North Carolina State
Bar in, any way feels that your conduct in this matter was -excusable or was
considered by the members of the Hearing Committee of the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission to be less th~ a very ser.ious and substan~ial violation of the
Code of Professional Responsibility. You ul)dertookto represent your client,
Bonnie Davis McGee, in settling her claim wi-th the ,Michigan Miller's Mutual
Insurance company for fire damage to the residence which she owned and was
occupied by her mother. After successfully negotiating a satisfactory
agreement wtth the insur~de company and receiving the .dra:i;t, you failed in
your duties to your client to fully protect her i'nterest$,. ·First, your.', client
had instructed you to denver $9,000 to her upon 'completion of the
transaction. Second" Y0l.\r client had instru.cted you ,to deliver'to her son the
balance of the proceedsd,ue her. Instead of deposi~ing your client's fundS in
a trust bank account" pennitting the draft to clear, and disbursing the funds
in a ~ner in Which y.ou could ,be assured that the funds were properly
disbursed ,and could acceunt .forthefunds, you pennitted :a third patty to
receive the draft in a negotiable form upon receipt of $8,,000 - $12,000" .the
exact amount of which you: do not know to ·this day, and the promise that
additional funds would be. delive~ed to your client later. Your client did' not
receive those funds. Your client then retained the services of other counsel
who demanded an accouhtinb for the funds ,from Y9U which you failed to
proviOe. In fact, you failed to maintain any records from which you could
produce an accounting for: these fUnds and you have yet to account for the
proCeeds.

The Code 'of PJ:ofessional Responsibility specifically reqUires that you
deposit all funds of clients that you received into a trust account" that you
