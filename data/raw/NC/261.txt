AFFIDAVIT

To: The Council of the North Carolina State Bar
I, Willie O. Dixon IV, hereby tender my license to practice law and desire to resign from the
North Carolina State Bar. My resignation is extended freely and voluntarily and is not the result of
coercion or duress, and I am fully aware of the implications of submitting this, my resignation.
I am aware that there is pending an investigation regarding allegations that I have violated
the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct, to wit:
1. I misappropriated funds from a number of clients between 1996 and 1998, including
settlement funds belonging to a client named Barbara Houston.
2. In 1998, I requested that Ms. Houston sign an affidavit which incorrectly stated that Ms.
Houston had agreed to lend me the proceeds of her personal injury settlement as of June 26, 1996
and I had executed a note agreeing to repay these funds to her. I attached to the affidavit a
document which purported to be a note securing the "loan" from Ms. Houston. In fact, the note
was drafted by me and signed by Ms. Houston in 1998 but dated as of 1996. TIle balance owing on
the note that was executed by me to Ms. Houston is currently being repaid to Ms. Houston.
I acknowledge that the material facts alleged herein are true. I am submitting my
resignation because I know that I cannot successfully defend against these allegations.
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, this the '1."l.~Q.ay of April, 1999.
