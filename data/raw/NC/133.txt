a.

The evidence shows Robinson abandoned his practice without
following the formalities required of lawyers in this state, which
are designed to protect the clients and the administration ofjustice.
Robinson's improper abandonment "of his practice harmed his
clients, including but not limited to the ones identified in this
order.

b.

Furthermore, as established by the evidence before the Hearing
Committee, the cases of several of Robinson's clients were
dismissed by the court with prejudice due to Robinson's failure to
-satisfYdiscoverY--Qb1igatioTIsonb@hal€e-ftheGlients,depriving'·'·''''..
those clients of the chance to pursue their claims. Bruce Temple
testified that he lost the opportunity to vindicate his reputation
when his case was dismissed with prejudice as a result of
Robinson's neglect. Mr. Temple was required to take ajob at
substantially less pay than his previous employment, and the loss
of reputation and loss of income will follow him for his lifetime.
Tony Johnson suffered similar harm as a result of the dismissal of
his case.

c.

Additionally, two of Robinson's clients suffered the additional
harm of having been ordered to pay costs stemming from
Robinson's failure to comply with discovery obligations, to wit:
Tony Johnson was taxed with $5,182.50 in costs by the U.S.
District Court for the opposing parties' costs in pursuing their
motion to compel discovery and motion to dismiss, and Bruce
Temple was taxed with $1,331.85 in costs by the u.s. District
Court for the opposing parties' costs in pursuing their motion to
compel discovery.

2.
The conduct of Robinson caused actual harm to the standing of the legal
profession, undermining his clients' trust and confidence in lawyers and the legal system.
3.
Robinson's conduct included conduct prejudicial to the administration of
justice, to wit: his failure to comply with discovery obligations in cases before the U.S.
District Court, interfering with the Court's ability to adjudicate those matters in an
orderly manner.
4.
Robinson was suspended from the practice oflaw before the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina on June 26,2007, because of
Robinson's conduct in failing to represent his clients in cases before the U.S. District
Court, including as found herein. The suspension is in effect pending the results of the
court's referral of the matter to the U.S. Attorney for investigation of violations of the
Disciplinary Rules of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North
Carolina and the conclusion of any proceedings undertaken by the North Carolina State
Bar.
5.
Robinson's failure to respond to letters of notice in grievances with the
State Bar and failure to participate in this disciplinary proceeding before the DHC results
in potential significant harm to the profession and to the public. The legal profession is
entrusted with the privilege of self-regulation. The State Bar can only regulate the
profession if its members respond to inquiries of the State Bar and otherwise participate.

7.

clients while contemporaneously neglecting existing clients;

b.

Pattern of misconduct;

c.

Multiple offenses;

d.

Refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct; and

9.
The Hearing Committee has reviewed the guidelines in the Standards for
Imposing Lawyer Sanctions issued by the American Bar Association. The Hearing
Committee notes that section 4.4 of the ABA's Standards, which discusses lack of
diligence, states that disbarment is generally appropriate when: (a) a lawyer abandons the
practice and causes serious or potentially serious iItiury to a client; (b) a lawyer
knowingly fails to perform services for a client and causes serious or potentially serious
injury to a client; or (c) a lawyer engaged in a pattern of neglect with respect to client
matters and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client. The Hearing
Committee finds that the evidence before it establishes that Robinson had engaged in all
three ofthese types of neglect described as circumstances in which disbarment is
appropriate.
10.
Although it considered discipline less severe than disbarment, the Hearing
Committee finds that (i) suspension, public censure, or reprimand would not be sufficient
discipline because of the gravity of the harm caused by the conduct of the Robinson to
the public, to Robinson's clients, to the profession, and to the administration ofjustice
and (ii) that discipline short of disbarment would not sufficiently protect the public, in
each instance for the following reasons:
a.

Robinson has engaged in multiple violations of the Revised Rules
of Professional Conduct over a substantial period of time and his
misconduct was not the result of a mistake, nor did it appear to be
an aberration;

b.

Robinson accepted new cases and funds from clients in 2005 and
2006 while contemporaneously neglecting existing clients who had
retained him as early as 2002 and 2003, benefitting himself while
showing incredible disregard for the harm he was causing his
clients;

c.

Robinson's conduct caused substantial harm to his clients,
substantial harm and potential harm to the profession, and included
conduct prejudicial to the administration ofjustice; and

d.

Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Robinson committed
and would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public
regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar of this
State.
