IN THE MATTER OF
W. ROBINSON DEAtON JR.
ATTORNEY AT LAW

,

REPRIMAND

On October 23, 1997, the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar met and
considered the grievances filed against you by the State Bar.
PUrsuant to Section .Ol13(a) of the DiscipIlne and Disability Rules of the North Carolina
State Bar,; the Grievance Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the
infotmati()h available to it, including your response to the letter of notice', the Grievance
Comn'litte~ found probable cause. Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable cause to
believe th~t a member of the North Carolina State Bar is guilty of misconduct justifying
disciplinary action."
The rules provide that after a finding of pcobable causy, the Grievance Committee may
determine :that the filing of a complaint and a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing
Connnission are not required, and the Grievance Committee may issue various levels of
discipline tlepending upon the misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any
aggravating or mitigating factors. The Grievance Committee may issue an admonition, a '
reprimand, or a censure to the respondent attorney.

I

A reprimand is a written form of discipline more serious than an admonition issued in
cases in w1;ri.ch an attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional
Conduct ru;td has caused harm or potential harm to a client, the administration of justice, the
profession, or a member of the public, but the misconduct does not require a censure.
1

The Grievance Coinmittee was of the opinion that a censure is not required in this case
and issues this reprimand to you. As chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North
Carolina S~aty Bar, it is now my duty to issue this reprimand, and I am certain that you will
understand fully the spirit in which this duty is performed.

On December 2, 1996, you were charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to
kill &nd discharging a firearm into an occupied vehicle. These charges stemmed from your firing
a ~h6tgun at a car driven by Angelique Weaver, wherein her husband, Kevill Wheeler, and two
small children were passengers. While no one was seriously injured, Mr. Weaver was grazed by
ij pellet.

,,'

On September 9, '1997, you pled no contest to misdemeanors of assault with a deadly
weapon and willful and wanton i~ury to personal property. Superior Court Judge J. Marlene
Hyatt entered a sentence of30 days in each of the misdemeanQr cases. iud&e Hyatt suspended
the sentences and ordered unsupervised probation for a period of 12 months upon the condition
that you pay the court costs and restitution in the amount of $100.00.

I

the North Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct. The Grievance Committee believes that your
conduct was very serious and it is in no way condoned by the North Carolina State Bar.
Fortunately for you and the occuparits of the Weaver vehicle, no one was killed. The Grievance
Committee was cognizant of the history between you and Mr. Weaver, including the numerous
police reports filed by you and your family, and the harassment you and your family endUred for
a long period of time. In addition, the Grievance Committee also considered the many character
letters that were submitted on yolJ!' behalf.
You are advised to seek lawful solutions to your problems and not take the law into your
own hands.
