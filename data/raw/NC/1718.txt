inexperience. '!he fact that the Committee did not refer this matter for
hearing by the DisciplinaIy Hearing Corrtmission does not mean it viewed your

account that, you have no prior discipline,' that you sought counseling
,'intrnediately ~fter your arrest arxl that you have suffered a substantial amount
of public, h~iation as a result of this matter.
