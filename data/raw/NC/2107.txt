Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of L.aw and upon
the evidence and arguments of thE;! parties concerning the appropriate discipline,the
hearing committee hereby makes these additional:
.
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. Defendant's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
(A) prior disciplinary offense;
(B) dishonest or selfish m()tive; ..
(C) a pattern of misconduct; .
(D)'multiple offenses;
(E) bad faith obstruction of t~e, disciplinary proceedings by intentionally
failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency;
(F) deceptive practices during the disciplinary process;
(G) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature 'of conduct; and
(K) issuance of a letter of warning to defendant in the same year as the
filing of the complaint

2. Defendant's misconduct is not mitigated by any factors.
3. The aggr~vating factor!? oytw~ig~ the mitigating factors.
-

~.

:: .

\ ' Il· ,

.', .

:

4. The hearing committee finds that defendant pled guilty to four separate
counts of criminal contempt of court relating to the investigation of this disciplinary
matter. The hearing committee finds that defendant willfully disobeyed numerous
orders of the Wake CountY Superior Court, which orders directed him to produce his
trust account records to the State Bar: The hearing committee also finds that defendant
intentionally obstructed and significantly delayed the S.tate Bar's investigation in an
attempt to avoid or delay -the discovery of his criminal and unethical misappropriation. of
client funds. Defendant was fined and censured for his willful disobedience of these
Court .orden~. The Superior Court's fine and the censure were imposed for his
disobedience of that court's orders only and did not adc:lress the allegations of
misappropriation and other trust account violations at issue in this matter

I

5. The hearing committee further-finds that defendant used funds
misappropri~ted from his clients for his own personal benefit. For example the hearing
committee specifically finds that Jenkins used client funds to pay his personal tax .
obligations to the IRS for 1996 after a lien was filed against him.
Based upon the foregoing aggravating and mitigating factors and the arguments
of the parties, the hearing committee hereby enters the following:
