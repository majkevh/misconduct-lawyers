various levels of discipline depending 'upon the misconduct, t'he
c:tctual or potential injury caused, and Â·any aggravating or
mitigating factors. The Grievance Committee may issue an
admonition, reprimand, or censure to the respondent attorney.
A reprimand is a written form of discipline more serious
than an admonition issued in cases in. whioh an attorney ha!3
violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional
Conduct and has caused harm or potential harm t'O a client, t:qe
administration. of justice, 'the profession, or a member of the
pub:J.ic, but the miscondt~ct does' not require a censure.
The Grievance c::ommittee was ot the opinion that a censure is
not required in this case and issues this reprimand to you. AS
chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina. State
Bar, it is now my duty to issue this reprimand and I am ce:rtain
that you will understand fully the spirit in which this duty :Ls
performed.
On November 10, 1993, you ~ntered a plea of guilty to an,
infraction of Title 18 U.S. Code Sections 2511(1) (d) and
2511(4) (b) (ii). Your plea arose out of your conduct prior to the
1992 gubernatorial election of listening to a tape recording of
cordless telephone calls by members of the family of Jim Gardner,

By listening to a tape recording of cordless telephone calls in
violation of federal law, you ehgaged in a criminal act which
reflect/? adversely upon your honesty, trustworthiness or fitnesS
as a lawyer, in violation of Rule 1.2(B) of the Rules of
Professionai Conduct.
While the Grievance Committee by no meahs condones your
misconduct in this matter, it did note that you promptly and
fully admitted your wrongdoing, that you cooperated with the
federal government, and that you have been substantially punished
already by the publicity surrounding your federal conviction.
The Comrnitt~e is further aware that you have had a long,
honorable c~reer as a lawyer and jurist and believes that this
incident ma~ks an aberration-which will never be re~eated by you.

the Council of the North Carolina State Bar regarding the taxing
of the administrative and investigative costs to any attorney
