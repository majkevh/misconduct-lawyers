.

..

Hearing Committee also enters the following

I

FINDINGS RI=GARDING DISCIPLINE

a. a pattern of misconduct;
o '
b. multiple 'offenses; and
c. substantial experience in the practice of law.

d. personal difficulties and incidents of office damage leading to
disruption in the operation of defendant's law practice; and
e. good reputation in the legal community .
• 3. Defendant's conduct in failing to obtain title insurance policies in more

purchased. The Hearing Committee finds and concludes that under the
circumstances of this case, given the number of clients affected, the public will
not be adequately protected by a censure and that a stayed suspension is
necessary to allow implementation of conditions to ensure the protection of the
publiCI and defendant's future clients.
