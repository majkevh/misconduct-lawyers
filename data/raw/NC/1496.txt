In september, 19B1, the Defendant was employed to
represent Lila M. Armstrong (Armstrong) relative
to a claim she had against Michael C. Browning for
inj uries su·sta! ned in an autotnbile accident on
September 13, 1981.

5.

In late September, 1981, the Defendant was able to
negotiate a satisfactory settlement of his
client's claim for pr~perty damage with the Horace
Mann !nsurance Company.
!t was agreed that
Armstrong would accept the sum of $1,778.12 in
satisfaction of that asp~ct of her claim.
On or
about September 22, 1981, the Horace Mann
Ttisurance Company issued and mailed td the
Defenda'nt dra.ft number 975594 in the specified
amount p~yable to the order of t~e Dsfetidant and
his client, Lila Armstrong.
Altho~gh

the Defendant maintain~d a trust account
at North Carolina National Bank for the purpose of
handling client funds received in trust during the
time in question, the draft mentioned in the
pre c e din g p ~ rag rap h was not d'e p 0 sit e din the
Defendant's trust a c c 0 u ri t b u t , rather, wa·s
deposited in his personal account at North
carolitta Nat~onal bank from which accotint
disbtirsements were made to the De£endant and his
client ia accordance with their contingent fee
cdntract.

In December, 1981., the Defendant negotiated a
satisfactory settlement of his client's personal
injury claim w~th the Horace Mann tnsurance
Company.
The Defendant's client,agrsed to 4ccept
the sum o£ $4,500 in full settlemant of that
aspect of her claim.
On or about December 28,
1981, the H6race Mann Insurance Company issued and
m~iled to the Defendant draft number 1012692 in
the amount q·f$4,500 payable t9 the Defendant and
bis clLent, .Lila Ar~strong~
Rather than
depositing this instrumerit in his trust account,
the Defendant Caused appropriate endorsement~ to
be placed upon the instrumen~ and negotiated i t
for cash.
From the proceeds, the Defendant paid
himself $1,500, which represented his fee.
Of the
remaining $3,000 to which hi$ client was entitled,
he paid his client $2,5~0 and retained, ~ith his
client's permission, the sum of $500 in trust to
satiSfy hisciient's obligation to Dr. sampson E.
Harrell for medical treatment necessitated by her
injuries,'which obligation was at that ~ime
unliquidated.

I

8.

The Defendant 4id not~eposit tne $500 wn~ch .h.
had retained for tbe purpos9 of paying Dr. Barrell
in his trust account; nor did he' maintain any
contemporaneous re cor ds of ac cotin t concerni n.g
those funds.

9.

In June, 1986, th~ Defendant issued und-a.te-d trust
account check number 401 to Dr. Harrell int.he
amount of $535 to pay for medical service$
rendered to his client, ~ila ArmstIong.

I

I

.

Based upon the foregoing Fi_ndings. of Fact,
makes the following conclusions of Law:
1.

t-he committee

By failing to deposit client funds recei~~d
trust in a trust account a ndby fa i 1.i,.n 9' t:o
s.egreg.ate, cl.ient funds from personal funds,
Defendant failed to maintain trust funds ~n
identifiable bank account separate from his
per sonal funds in vio la tion. of Di scipl in~ry
9-1n2(A) o£ the North Carolina Code of
professional Responsibility;

in
the
an
Rule

2.

By failing to keep any contemporaneous acco~nt of
the money entr'usted to him for the paymen.t· of hi a
clierrt's doct,or, the pe·fen~ant fai_led to ma;ip.ta.in
complete records of funds of a client coming i.nto
his posl;ession in violation of biscipl;i:nary' Rule'
9-102(B} (3) of the Nor·th Carolina Code -of
professional Responsibility; and

3.

By faiJ,.ing to pay his client's doctormon·ey.
entrusted to him for that purpose for *ore than
four years, the Detendant failed to promptl~ pay
funds in his possession as directe-d by hiscli'ell,t
in violation of Disciplinary Rule 9-102{~)(4) ~f
the North Carolina Code of professional
Re.Sponsibi Ii ty.

I

Based upo.n th'e stipulations o.f the parties an'd t:he
evidence at tr'ial, the Commi tte·e makes' the fallowing l1'·ih·d.i,n.gs
Fact in regard to the plaintiff's Second claim for Ral~ef by
clear 4 cogent and convincing evidence:
1•

Q:f

On Augul;t 13, 1984, the Defendant ~~intained a
balance of $10,108.05 in his trust account.
of
that sum $6,805.75 waS money belonging to the
Defendant, consist.i,ng for the most p.art. o.f le~aJ,.
faes which had been earned in ~he p~eced;ing months
and which had never been transferre~ fiom tbe
trust account into the Defendant's person~l
account.
The balance was money entrusted t9 the
Defendant by clients.

,.1

-~.

--.

:-.,~.. ~~

During the per iod between August 13 j 1984, and
S~ptember 14, 1984, the Dsfendantwrote two checks
on his trust account, numbers 377 and 381, each
payable to cash in the amounts of $2,081.40 ahd
$7,500, respectively.
The proceeds from the
negotiation of those two instruments were used to
compromise a claim being made against the
Defendant by the co-owner of his home.
At least $1,7?5065 of the money held in trust for
clients was mistakenly used to fund checks 377 and
381.

3.

At the end of June, 1985, the Defendant maintained
a balance in hiS trust account of $7,578.97.
Of
this amount, ho mote than $3,088.58 were client
funds being. held in trust.
The remaining funds
belonged to the Defandant and consisted mostly of
Legal fees which had been allowed to accumulate in
the accourtt over a period of many months.

4.

On or abou-t July 2, 19-85, the Defendant
transferred the entire balance in his t~ust
account, $7,578.97, into his personal account.

5.

All trust funds which were thus transferred were
and paid in accordance with clients'

p~eserved

instr~ctions.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact,
makes the following. Conclusions of Law:

the Committee

1.

By failing to segregate client funds from personal
funds, the befendartt commingled trust funds and
personal funds in violation of bisaiplinary Rule
9-102(A) of the North Carolina C.ode of
Professional Responsibility; and

2.

By inadvertently using client funds ent~usted to
him to satLsfy his own personal obligation,
the De£.ndant engaged in professional c6nduct that
adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law
and failed to maintain client funds in trust in
violation of Disciplinary Rules 1~102(A)(6) and
9-1b2(A), respectively, of the North carolina Code
of professional Responsibility-

3.

No other alleged violations of the Code of
professional Responsibility were proven.

During the. period betwe.en August 13, 1984, C1.nd se·pt~mbe.r 14,
1984, YQu wrote two ch,ecks on your trust account, .nu.mber$ 377 4'nd
381, each payable to cash in the ~~ounts of $2,081.40 ~nd ",SOO~
respectively.
The proceeds f~om t~e negotiation Of th~se two
instrument's were u'sed to comprom'ise a clC1.im being made aga,ihst
you by the co-owner of your home.
At least $1,77~.65 Of the
·mqney·held in trust fo,r clien-tswas u.sed to fund crte'ck,s 377. and
381.
At the end of June, 198$, you maintained a balanc,~ in. y.ou,r
trust acco~nt of $7.,578.97.
of this amount, no ~ore than
$3,088.58 were client fuhds being held i~'trust.
The re~alnin~
funds belonged to you and consisted mostly of legal fe;es wQ·iQ,fi
had heen al~owed to accumulate in the account qver a per~64 of
many montbs.
on or about, July 2, 1985, you transferred the entire b41ance
in you r t r u s t a c co u nt, $ 7 , 5 7 8 • 9 7 l i n to you r per s o,n ~ i a c co unt ; .
All trust funds wrtich were thus transferred were pre.erved
and paid in accordanCe with clients' instructions.

I

The con.duc't which you have a<;imitted in this aC1:, io n viOlat.ed
numerous provisions of the Code ~f Professional RespohSi»iiittYOU c.ommingled client funds ih violation of Di!;lciplinary Rl.lle
9-102(A), you failed to maintain adequate record~ as requ,i~ed b¥
Disciplinary Rule 9-102(B)(3) and you failed to abide by your
client I s instructions in regard to t'hedisbursement of her. f'unds
in violation of Disciplinary Rule 9-102{B)(4).
Mo~t significant,
however, was your misappropriation of clie'nt fun.ds, albeit by

43

ina d v e.r ten c e, in vi 0 I a t ion 0 f Dis c i P lin a r y Rti I e 9 - 1 0 2 ( A)
yoU r
conduct adversely reflected upon your fitness to practice law in
violation of Disciplinary Rule 1-102(A)(6).
0

JU'st as surely as your actions violated the letter of the
disciplinary rules cited herein, i t als.o violated the spirit of
the Code of Professional Responsibiiity.
Your conduct was
unprof·e.ssional and placed your privilege to practice law in
serious jeopardy.
Your conduct tended to cast disrepute upon not
only yourself but also upon your fellow members of the Bar.

The Hearing Committee was ultimately persuaded that your
misconduct in this ca~e was generally the product of gross
ne9ligence rather than deliber~tion.
primarily for that reason
you were not suspeQded from the practice of law as urged by the
Counse~ for the State Bar.
Nevertheless, the Committee is
comp.lled to obsarVe that your misconduct, p~rticularly in light
of your training as a certified publi~ acc.ountant, was outrageous
and totally inconsistent ~ith the high standard ot care and
fidelity required .of attorneys in this state.
A client ~ho
entrusts his or her property to a lawyer has a right to expect
that the property will be preserved in accordance with well
understood principles .of fiduciary responsibility.
your conduct
mocked of our professional standards in this regard.
T-h.e fact that th'e Hearing Committee has .chosen 'to impose the
relati.ely moderate san~tion of public cen~u~e sh.oul4 not be
taken by tau to indicate that the Discipli~ary Hearing Commissio~
in any w.ay feels that Y9ur co'nduct i.n this matter was excusable.
Were i t not for the presence ot several significarit mitigating
circumstances, j t is likely that a mere severe disciplinary
sanctien weuld have been impesed.
The Committee was particularly
impressed by yeur coeperatien with the State Bar in its
,investigatien as well as by yeur diligent efferts to recencile
yeur books and medify yeur procedures in order that a recUrrence
.of this sert of misconduct might be prevented.
It was arso neted
that none of your clients suffered any permanent less as a result
of your miscenduct.
The North CaIoliha State Bar is confident that this public
Censure will be heeded by yeu, that i t will be remembered by yeu,
and that i t will be a benefit te you.
Hepefully, yeu will never
again ~llow yourself to depart frem strict adherence to the
highest standards of the legal profession.
Accordingly, i t is
heped that this Public Censure, instead of being a bUrden, will
actually serve as ~ prefitable reminder that yeu sheuld weigh
carefully yeur respens~bilities to the public, yeur clients, yeur
fellew attorneys and the Court to the end that yeu will
ultimately be kno~n as a respected member .of .our professien whese
word and conduct can be relied upen ~itheut question.
pursuant to Section 23 of the Rules of Disciplinary
procedure, i t is ordered that a certified copy of this Public
Censure be entered upon the judgment docket of the Superior Court
