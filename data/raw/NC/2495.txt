The contract executed by Young and J ~ffreys required Young. to e~ecutea

"uee Statement to be filed with the Secretary of State's Office and the Register of
Deeds." In the contract, Young agreed to pay the recording fee .

. 7.
On or about January H), 2003, Kincheloe wrote to yann and notified him
that the vec statement had not been filed. Kincheloe stated this failure had hanned his
client, Jeffr~ys, by placing him in an unsecured creditor position in Young's subsequent
bankruptcy. Kincheloe stated he felt Vann had a responsibility, as Young's attorney, to
ensure that Young had met his contractual obligation to file the vee statement and
indicated an intent,to explore Vann's liability in the situation.

In January 2003, Vann asked his assistant, Lucie Lea Robson ("Robson"Y,
to gather all documentation and correspondence regarding the Young and Jeffreys matter
from the firm's files and to file those documents in one file for him. Vaim gave Robson'
the letter from Kincheloe described above.

Vann notified his legal malpractice carrier, Lawyers Mutual, of
Kincheloe's allegation in January.2003. Vann and Will Graebe ("Graebe") of Lawyers
Mutual discussed the matter on seyeral occasions between January alld March 2003. In
the course of these conversations, Graebe asked whether there was documentation
regarding the vec filing. Vann told Graebe he thought there were two or three lettel'S
addressing the vec filing issue. Graebe requested that Vann send him a copy of the file.
12.
On March 24, 2003, Vann asked Robson to fax three letters to Will
Graebe at Lawyers Mutual and then to mail- a complete copy of the consolidated file to
Graebe. In the process of assembling the fax, Robson noticed a letter dated June 15,
2000 and another dated June 30, 2000 ("the June 2000 letters"). Both'letters contained a
paragraph stating that if Young would like Vann to assist Young with the filing of the
uee statement, that Vann would be glad to do so.

The June 2000 letters with this language did hot exist when Robson had.
gathered all the documents.and.correspondence for the Young and Jeffreys matter in

2000 and june 30, 2000 letters addressed to Mr. Young to support my

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fad and Conclusions of Law and upon the
evidence and arguments of the parties concerning appropriate discipline, the hearing.
committee hereby finds by clear, cogent and convinqiJ,:lg evidence tbe fol~owing
additional
"
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCrPLINE

I

1.

2.

I

The Defendant's misconduct is aggravated by.the foHowing factors:
a.

One ,prior disciplinary offense, an admonition issued in 2001;

b.

Dishonest or selfish motive, but not fQr monetary gain;

c.

A pattern of misconduct;

d.

Multiple offenses;

e.

Submission of a false statement to the Grievance COJ,nmittee; and

f.

Substantial experience in the practice oflaw.

The Defendant's misconduct is mitigated by the following factors:
a.

Full and free disclosure to the hearing committee;

b.

Cooperative attitude toward the proceedings;

c.

Good character and reputation;

d.

tnterim rehabilita~ion; and

e. '

Genuine remorse.

3.
Th~ weight of the mitigating factors outweighs the weight of the
aggravating factors.
4.
Defendant's dishonest conduct OVe]; a seemingly minor matter is condl]"ct
of concern. It is also a matter of concern that the letters falsified by Defendant were
provided to Lawyers Mutual as potential evidence and that the letters would tend to shift
responsibility for filing the UCC statement from Defendant to his client. Defendant's
conduct caused significant potential harm to his client, to Lawyers Mutual, and to the
profession.
5.
The cleat, cogent, and convincing evidence before the Hearing
Committee, however, showed that Defendant is a person of excellent character and
reputation and that the conduct was an aberration and was unlikely to be repeated. The

- 4-

I

';.,

evidence also sh<rwed that Defendant clearly understands the nature and wrongfulness of
his conduct and- is genuinely remorseflIl.
I
6.
Although this Hearing Committee considered imposing some type of
suspension in this matter and finds that a suspension can be appropriate and can be
necessary to protect the public when the attorney's misconduct involves dishonesty, the
Hear~ng Committee reached a different decision regarding discipline in light of the
. '.
evidence before it in this case. Based upon tile testimony of Defendant, the testimony of
the cnaracter witnesses, and the totality of the eVIdence before it, the Committee
determined that, in this case, a censure is appropriate and will be sufficient to protect the
publi<j:. In light of the significant potential harm presented by Defendant's conduct,
however, the Committee finds that discipline ofless than a public censure would not
sllfficiently protect the public and would not be appropriate.

I'

Based lipon the foregOing factors and the arguments of the parties, the heating
comITJittee hereby ~nters the follOWing
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1.

The Defendant, James R. Vann, is hereby censured .

. 2.
The Defendant shall pay the costs in this matter within 30 days of servIce
upon him of a statement of the costs.
