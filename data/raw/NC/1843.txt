application to the Membership Committee of the N.C. State Bar (lithe

, In mid-December, 1993, Kendall Was advised by the State Bar that he was not
'permitted to practice law until the Membership Committee had considered his
! application and an order of reinstatement had been entered.

6.

I

Even though Kendall knew his license was suspended and he was not permitted to
.practice law until his license had been reinstated, Kendall engaged in the practice
of law regarding the following matters prior to his reinstatement:

I

I

a. Marsha Gail Busby - Kendall appeared in court in Statesville on January 18,
1994, on behalf of Ms. Busby who was charged with no operator's license,
driving 60 m.p.h. in a 45 m.p.h. zone, and obstructing and delaying a public
'officer. Kendall met with the assistant district attorney, Lynn Gullett, and
negotiated a plea of gUilty to the charge of obstructing and delaying a public
.officer in exchange for a dismissal of the no operator's license and speeding
charges. Kendall subsequently appeared before the presiding judge and entered a
plea of guilty on behalf of his client to the charge of obstructing and delaying a
public officer.

I

p. Thomas Dion Daye - Kendall appeared in court in Statesville on January 18,
~994,

on behalf of Mr. Daye who was charged with driving while license
permanently revoked. Kendall advised the assistant district attorney, Lynn

$ubsequently appeared before the presiding judge and entered a plea of guilty on
behalf of his client to the charge of driving while license permanently revoked.

zone.
Kendl;lll met with the assistant district attorney, Jean Rogers, ~rtd
negotiated a plea of improper equipment.. Kendall subsequently appeared before
the presiding judge and entered a plea of guilty on behalf of his client to the
charge of improper equipment.

On January 20, 1994, Carotin D. Bakewell, Counsel to the State Bar, ,and Harry
B. Warren, Director of Investigations, spo,ke with Kendall by

tel~phone.

,Ms.

Bakewell asked Kendall whether he had been practicing law since learning- that he
had been suspended.

8.

Kendall at first denied that he had been practicing law but later admitted that he had met with an assistant district attorney concerning Leon Daye, - who was
charged with possession of cocaine and several traffic offenses. Kendall advised
that this meeting occurred in the anteroom of the courthouse and th.at the assistant
district attorney 4ad agreed to dismiss the traffic charges agaiIl&t Daye in return
for a waiver of probable cause as to the drug charge. Kendall assured Bakewell
and Warren that he did not appear before the court l;lnd was not attorney of
record.

I

9.

During this conversation, Kendall did not disclose that in the previous two days
he had represented Marsha Gail Busby, Thom~sDion ])aye, and Teresa Elaine
Gilleland with the criminal matters described. in paragraph six above.

10.

Immediately following this telephone conversation, Kendall wrote Ms. Bakewell
and after further discussing the Leon Daye case, stated: "I have not practiced. law
since made aware of my suspension." However, as alleged above, in the two
days prior to this letter, Kendall had appeared in court on behalf of Marsha Gail
Busby, Thomas Dion Daye, and Teresa Elaine Gilleland.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact,. the conunittee makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.

By defending Marsha Gail Bqsby, Thomas Dion Daye, and Teresa ElaiAe
Gilleland in court concerning their various criminal charges while his license was
suspended, Kendall practiced law without a license in violatioll of N.C. Gen.

I

I

.....

Stat. Section 84-28 (b) (2) and Rule 3.1(B) of the North Carolina Rules of
'Professional Conduct.
2.

3.

;By practicing law after learning that his license was suspended and prior to the
order of reinstatement, after he was specifically advised by the State Bar that he
was not permitted to practice law until his license was reinstated, Kendall
knowingly engaged in contempt of the council'S order of suspension dated
November 12, 1992 in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. Section 84-28(b)(3).
By failing to disclose his representation of Marsha Gail Busby, Thomas Dion
Daye, and Teresa Elaine Gilleland in his 1120/94 telephone conversation with
Bakewell and Warren, Kendall failed to disclose a fact necessary to correct a
misapprehension moWn by Kendall to have arisen in the matter and10r knowingly
failed to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority

I

in violation of Rule 1.1 (B).
4.

By stating in his 1120/94 letter to Ms. Bakewell that he had not practiced law
&ince December 1993, Kendall knowingly made a false statement of material fact
in. connection with a disciplinary matter in violation of Rule 1.1(A) and/or
engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in
violation of Rule 1.2(C).
Signed by the hearing committee members, this the 28th day of April, 1995.
