Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the hearing panel
finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following additional
FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
Anderson's conduct - to wit: severe neglect of multiple client matters, failure to
adequately communicate with his clients, failure to resolve the matters for which he was
retained, and misappropriation of entrusted client funds - impaired his clients' ability to achieve
the goals of the representation, deprived his clients of the use of the funds entrusted to
Anderson's care, and unnecessarily delayed resolution of his clients' pending cases, including
but not limited to clients Hoyle and Lind.
2.
Anderson's known and willful misapplication and conversion to his personal use
of entrusted client funds constitutes embezzlement pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 14-90, a felony
criminal offense.
3.
Clients are entitled to attorneys they can trust. Anderson, by engaging in
neglectful and dishonest conduct, has shown himself to be not trustworthy.
4.
Anderson misappropriated his clients' funds and abandoned his law practice
without making any efforts toward restitution for his clients. In doing so, Anderson elevated his
interests above those of his clients. Anderson's conduct demonstrates his dishonest and selfish
motive, his intent to cause the resulting harm or potential harm, and his intent to commit acts
where the harm or potential harm is foreseeable.
5.
Self-regulation of the legal profession relies upon the cooperation and
participation of lawyers in the self-regulatory process. When a lawyer knowingly and
intentionally submits false evidence in the disciplinary process, as Anderson did here, it impedes
and undermines the system of self-regulation.
6.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of discipline
available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and disbarment, in
considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, and upon consideration ofthe factors set forth in 27 N.C. Admin. Code
Chapter 1, Subchapter B, ยง .0114(w), the hearing panel hereby enters the following additional

8

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all ofthe factors enumerated in 27
N.C. Admin. Code 1B ยง .Ol14(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes that the following factors are applicable in this matter:

a. Defendant's dishonest or selfish motive;
b. Defendant's indifference to making restitution;
c. Defendant's pattern of misconduct;
d. Defendant's multiple offenses;
e. Defendant's bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceedings by intentionally
failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency; and
f.

Defendant's submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive
practices during the disciplinary process.

2.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C. Admin. Code 1B ยง .Ol14(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes Defendant has engaged in the following conduct that compels consideration
of and warrants disbarment of Defendant's license:
a. Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication;
b. Misappropriation or conversion of assets entrusted by clients to Defendant to
which Defendant was not entitled; and
c. Commission of a felony.
3.
The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C. Admin. Code 1B ยง .0114(w)(1) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors warrant disbarment or suspension of Defendant's
license:
a. Defendant's intent to commit acts where the harm or potential harm was
foreseeable;
b. Circumstances reflecting Defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness, or
integrity;
c. Defendant's actions had a potential negative impact on his clients' and the
public's perception of the legal profession;
d. Negative impact of Defendant's actions on the administration of justice;
e. Impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the representation; and
9

f.

Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication.

4.
Defendant's neglect, failure to communicate, failure to resolve the matters for
which he was retained, and misappropriation of entrusted client funds caused significant harm to
his clients.
5.
Defendant's conduct caused significant harm to the public and to the
administration of justice by unnecessarily delaying resolution of his clients' cases. Justice is
achieved when all matters are timely pursued and resolved; justice is impeded by attorneys who
knowingly abandon their clients and their duties as an attorney, leaving their clients' cases and
their clients' interests in an unnecessarily nncertain status such as that created by Defendant.
6.
Defendant's habitual neglect of his clients' matters has the potential to cause
significant harm to the standing of the legal profession in the eyes of the public because it shows
his disregard for his duties as an attorney. Defendant's commission of criminal acts reflecting
adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer also caused significant potential
harm to the profession in that criminal conduct by attorneys tends to bring the legal profession
into disrepute. Such erosion of public confidence in attorneys tends to sully the reputation of,
and fosters disrespect for, the profession as a whole. Confidence in the legal profession is a
building block for public trust in the entire legal system.
7.
Defendant caused significant potential harm to the profession in that Defendant's
submission of false information in response to inquiries from the State Bar demonstrates a
refusal to participate in the self-regulation process. Such conduct interferes with the State Bar's
ability to regulate its members and nndermines the profession's privilege to remain selfregulating.
8.
The hearing panel has considered all other forms of discipline available and
concludes that any sanction less than disbarment would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of
the offenses committed by Defendant and would send the wrong message to attorneys and the
public regarding the condnct expected of members of the Bar. The hearing panel further
concludes that any sanction less than disbarment would not adequately protect clients, the public,
the administration of justice, and the profession.
9.
Due to the nature and extent of Defendant's conduct, the significant actual harm
and potential harm caused by Defendant's conduct, and in the interest of protecting clients, the
public, the administration of justice and the profession, this panel concludes that disbarment is
the only discipline that will adequately protect clients, the public, the administration of justice,
and the profession from future transgressions by Defendant.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and the additional
Findings and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel enters the following

10
