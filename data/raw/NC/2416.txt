the American GeneraJ note and deed of trust.

: Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact; the hearing committee hereby
enters 'the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. The Disciplinary Hearing Commission has jurisdiction over the subject
of this ,proceeding and over the person of the Defendant, N. Jero?1e Willingham.
!

; 2. By tempo~arily misappropriating funds belonging to George WigfaIi
for the use of himself, and third parties without Wigfall's consent, Willingham
engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in
violation of Rule 8.4(c), engaged in criminal conduct in violation of Rule 8.4(b)
and engaged in a conflict of interest in violation of Rule 1.7 (a).

I

: 3. By ~sappropriating funds belonging to Ms. Lane and Lawrence
Marshburn for the benefit of Illmself and/or third parties without his clients'
consent, Willingham 'engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or
misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c) and engaged in criminal conduct in
violati~m of Rule 8.4(b).
: 3. By failing to disburse funds as directed by Wigfall, Ms. Lane and
Lawrence Marshburn, Willingham failed to pay,or deliver client funds as directed
by his ~Iients in violation of Rule 1.15-2(m).

I

(o{1

4. By failing to maintaill a sufficient balance on hand to pay sums owed to
Wigfall, Ms. Lane and Marshburn, Willingham failed to hold client funds intact in
violation of Rule 1.15.,2(a).

I

5. By willfuIlyand intentionally failing to comply with the terms of a
lawful order from the Chairman of the Grievance Committee, Willingham failed
t9 respond to a demand for information of a disciplinary authority in violation of
. Revised Rule 8.I(b) and engaged in conduct amounting to contempt of the
Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar in violation of N.C. Gen.
Stat. Section .84-28(b)(3).

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the .
hearing committee enters the following
.
FINDINGS OF FACT REGAR1)ING DISCIPLINE
1. Willingham's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
a) Selfish and dishonest motive
b) Illdjfference to restitution
c) Prior discipline

d) Pattern of misconduct
e) MUltiple rule violations

I

f) Substantial experience in the practice of law

g) tack of cooperation with the State Bar's investigation.
h) Several of Willingham's victims were particularly vuhierable.
Marva Lane was dying from cancer when Willingham received her funds, and
"Lawrence and Shirley Marshburn are both ill. George Wigfall is a retired
th
pipefitter with a 6 grade education and was in his 80s as ofthe July 2003 loan
closing conducted by Willingham.
3. There are no mitigating factors present.
4. The ag~ravating :factors substantially 'outweigh the mitigating factors.
5. Willingham'S misconduct has caused substantial actual harm to his
clients, Marva Lane, Lawrence Marshbur:~l and George Wigfall, Sr., and has also

I
0.;'

harmed the standing of the legal profession in the eyes of some members of the
public. Willingham's delay in paying off the American General loan caused
American General to discuss foreclosing on Wigfall's house. Wigfall was So
distres~ed by the situation that he could not sleep at night.
6. Although the hearing committee declined to grant the State Bar's
motion to sanction Willingham for his failure to produce various records in
I
compliance with an order entered by the Chair of the hearing conunittee prior to
the·'trial of this matter, the committee finds that Willingham's failure to comply
with the order was without justification and was done to obstruct the State Bar's
investigation and prosecution of this matter.
~

~

I

'J. An order of disciplhw short of disbamient would not sufficiently
protect the public for the following reasons:
I

.
a) Willinghain engaged in multiple violations of the Revised Rules
of Professional Conduct over a substantial period of time. His conduct therefore
was no~ the result of an aberration or mistake, but is the product of a serious
persona).ity flaw that is not readily changeable.
b) Willingham has offered no evidence'that he has addressed the
problem or flaw that motivated his criminal conduct and other violations of the
Revised Rules of Professional Conduct. Indeed, he has ignored. and obstructed
the State Bar's attempts to investigate this matter. Consequently, the Committee
fmds that there is a substantial risk that Willingham would continue to engage in
misconcJ.uct ifhe were petmitted to retain his law license.
c) Willingham has previously been disciplined hy the State Bar.
Thepriot order of discipline, which suspended Willingham's law license for
unrelaten trust account 'violatioilS, apparently failed to prevent Willingham from
engaging in additional, more serious violations of the Revised Rules of
Professional Conduct. ....
.
d) If Willingham's law license was merely suspended for a term
certain, he would be permitted to resume the practice of law without first having
to demonstrate that he has reformed and is no longer a threat to the public. Only
art ordeti of disbarment shifts the burden of proof to the attorney to demonstrate
rehabilitation and good character before reinstatement occurs.

I

e) Entry of an order imposing less serio:us discipline would fail to
acknOWledge the seriousness of the offenses which Willingham committed, would
be incotisistent with orders of discipline entered by the Commission in similar
cases and would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the
conduct :expected of members of the Bar of this State.
I

I

f) Willingham's misconduct has jeop;:rrdized the profession's
ability to remain self regulating. Lawyers cannot continue to enjoy this privilege
ifmembers·ofthe Bar do not respond to lawful orders and inquiries of the
regulatory authority.
BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, there hearing committee hereby enters the
~pIJ?wing:

I

ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1. The Defendant, N. Jerome Willingham, is hereby DISBARRED from
•
the practice of law in North Carolina.
2. Willingham must pay the costs of this action, including the costs incurred by
the State Bar in taking the depositions of Lawrence Marshburn and George Wigfall,
which the he$illg committee found were necessary for the State Bar to prosecute thls
case, within 30 days of service of the statement of costs by the Secretary.
3. Willingham may not seek reinstatement of his license to practice law until he
submits written proof that he has made :full restitution to the estate of Marva Lane and
Lawrence Marshburn.
4. Willingham shall comply with all provisions of 27 NCAC IB Section .0124 of
the State Bar Discipline & Disability Rules and shall surrender his license and
membership card to the Secretary of the N.C. State Bar along with the affidavit required
by Section.0124.
