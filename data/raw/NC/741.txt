-

The facts giving rise to this order are not in dispute.
They were found at an inquiry conducted at the Court's request
by the New Hanover Superior Court, Robert D. Rouse, Jr., Judge
Presiding, on 31 May 1977 and Yi. Hunoval has agreed in writing
to their accuracy.
1.

They are as follows:

One Larry Bernard was tried at the October

1974 Session of New Hanover Superior Court and
convicted at that trial of rape, kidnapping,
felonious larceny of an automobile, and armed
robbery.

.

He was sentenced to death in the rape

case and terms of imprisonment were imposed in
'the remaining cases.

He was represented at trial

by Jay D. Hockenbury and Mathias P. Hunoval, both
of whom were appointed by the court for that
purpose.
2.

The cases were appealed to the Supreme Court

of North Carolina.

By order entered 3 October 1974

Mathias P. Hunoval was appointed to perfect and argue
the appeal.

The appeal was argued by Mr. Hunoval at

the Court's Fall Term 1975.

The Court found no error

in the trial in an opinion filed 7 October 1975 and
reported at 288 N.C. 321.

Bernard's execution was

scheduled for 24 October 1975.
3.

On 15 October 1975 Xx. Hunoval on behalf of

his client petitioned this Court in writing for a
stay of execution on the ground that:

"The appellant

intends to file a tiaely petition for writ of certiorari

i n t h e Supreme Court o f t h e U n i t e d S t a t e s t o
s e e k r e v i e w of h i s judgment and s e n t e n c e . "

THIS COURT IS OF THE OPINION THAT:

1.

It is the duty of an attorney to represent

his client "zealously within the bounds of the law."
Canon 7 , North Carolina State Bar Code of Professional Responsibility, 283 N.C. 783, 8 2 4 .

(Here-

inafter State Bar Code.)

2.

Mr. Hunoval had a duty to both his client

and this Court to file in the United States Supreme
Court an application for writ of certiorari.

This

duty arises from the facts that: (a) Mr. Hunoval's
client was subject to being executed by virtue of

a sentence of death imposed by the trial court and
in the imposition of which this Court found no legal
or constitutional error;

(b) the United States

Supreme Court at the time of this Court's ruling had
before it for consideration the question of whether
the -North Carolina law by which

1.k.

Hunoval's client

was sentenced to death was constitutional;

(c) Mr.

Hunoval obtained a stay of execution of the death
sentence from the Chief Justice of this Court upon
his representation that an application to the United
States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to
review our decision would be made;

(d) Mr. Hunoval

then requested and was denied leave to withdraw as
counsel in the case; and (e)'this Court suggested
that Mr. Hunoval proceed to file the application.
3.

That there was no provision for Mr. Hunoval

to be compensated for filing the application for
the writ in no way relieved him of the duty to file
it, nor does it mitigate his failure to perform this
duty.

"[Aln attorney appointed by the court to

defend cannot recover compensation from the public
for his services in the absence of an enabling
statute.

The reason is that an attorney, being an

officer of the Court
cum onere,
-

. . . takes his office

and one of the burdens of office

which custom has recognized is the gratuitous
service rendered to a poor person at the suggestion of the court."

"Right of Attorney Appointed by Court for Indigent Accused to, and Court's Power to Award,
Compensation by Public, in Absence of Statute

"The

rendition of free legal services to those unable
to pay reasonable fees continues to be an obligation of each lawyer

....

"

State Ear Code,

supra at 793.

Mr. Hunoval's refusal to file the application for writ of certiorari constitutes:
4.

a.

Dereliction of a clear duty owed
to his client and, under the circumstances, this Court;

5.

b.

Unprofessional conduct;

c.

Misconduct; and

d.

Malpractice.

This Court has not only the inherent power

but also the duty to discipline attorneys, who are
officers of the court, for unprofessional conduct.
Canon 3B(3), N. C. Code of Judicial Conduct, 283
N.C.

771, 773.

Unprofessional conduct subject to

this power and duty includes "misconduct, malpractice, or deficiency in character," State ex rel.
