undermined their trust in all lawyers.
5. An order caning for discipline short of disbarment would not
sufficiently protect the public for the following reasons:
a. Dickey engaged in a multiple violations of the Revised Rules
'of Professional Conduct over a period of approximatdy five
years. His misconduct was flot the result of a mistake, nor did
it appear to be an aberration and it therefore appears that his
misconduct is the product of a character flaw that is not readily
changeable.

I

b. Dickey has offered no plausi1;>le evidence or assurances that he
has addressed the problem or flaw that led to his misconduct.
Consequently, the Committee finds that there is a substantial

and that he not resume the practice oflaw until he
demonstrates that he underst~ds the Rules of Professional

acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses whieh Dickey
committed, would be inconsistent with the orders of discipline
entered by this body in similar cases and would send the wrong
message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct
expected of members of the Bar of this State.
