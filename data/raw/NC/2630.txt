REPRIMAND -

On January 18,2007 the Grievance Committee of the North Catolina State Bar met and
considered the grievances filed against you by the State Bar.
Pursuant to Section .0113(a) of the Discipline and Disability Rules of the North Carolina
State Bar, the Grievance Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the
information available to it, including your response to the letter of notice, the Grievance
Committee found probable cause. Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable cause to
believe that a member of the North Carolina State Baris guilty of misconduct justifying
disciplinary action."
I

The rules provide that after a finding of probable cause, the Grievance Committee may
determine that the filing of a complaint and a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission are not required,and the Grievance Committee may issue various levels of
discipline depending upon the misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any
aggravating or fuitigating factors,. The Grievance Committee may issue an admonition, a
reprimand, or a'censure to the respondent attorney.

I

A reprimand is a written form of discipline more serious than an admonition issued in
cases in which~n attorney has \riolated one or more provisions ofthe Rules of Professional
Conduct and ha~ caused harm or pbtential harm to a client, the administration of justice, the
profession, or atmember of the public, but the misconduct does not reqUire a censure.
The Gri~vance Committee was of the opinion that a censure is not required in this case
and issues this reprimand to you. As chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North
Carolina State I3ar, it is now my duty to issue this reprimand.
Lavon Elliott filed a petition for resolution of a fee dispute against you on in March 2006.
You were served with notice ofthe petition by certified mail on May 4, 2006 and Was directed to
respond in writing in 15 days but failed to do so. You did not participate in the fee dispute ,
resolution process. As a result of your failure to partiCipate in the fee dispute resolution process,
a grievance was filed. You :were served with the Letter of Notice on July 15,2006 and also

You are hereby reprimanded by the North Carolin~ State Bar for your professional
misconduct. The Grievance Committe~ trusts that you will heed this reprimand, that it will be
remembered by you, that it will be beneficial to you, and that you will never again allow yourself·
to depart from adherence to the high ethical standards of the legal profes$ion.

I

In accordance with the policy adopted October 15, 1981 by the Council of the North
