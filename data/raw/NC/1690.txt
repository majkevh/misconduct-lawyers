on July 16, 1992, th~ Grievance COmmittee of the North carolina state Bar
met and" considered the grievance filed against you by 'lbe North carolina state
Bar.

, Pursuant to section' 13 (A) of article IX of the Rules and Regulations of
the North carolina state ,Bar, the Grievance COmmittee corrlucted a preliminary
hearing. After considering the infomatioI) available to it, including your
response to the letter of notice, the Grievance Cormnittee, found probable
cause. Probable cause is defined in the rules as 'IIreasonable cause to believe
that a member of the North carolina state Bar is guilty of misconduct
justifying ,disciplinary action. II
.
'lbe rules provide ,that after a firrling of probable cause, the Grievance
Cormnittee may detennine that the filing of a c::orrplaint an:l a hea,ring before
the Disciplinary Hearing Canun.ission are not required and the Grievance '
Committee may issue various levels of discipline depending upon the
misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any aggrav~ting or
mitigating factors. 'lbe Grievance Committee may issue an admonition,
rep~imand, or censure to, the respondent attorney.
A reprimand is a Wr,l.tten form of discipline more serious than an
admonition issued in cases' in which an attorney has violated One or more
provisions of the RUles of PrOfessional Conduct and has caused hann or
potential hann to a client, the administration of justice, the profession, or
a member of the public" but the misconduct does not require a censure.

I

'!he Grievance, CorrItrdttee was of the opinion that a censure is not required
in this case and iSSUe:? this reprimand t9 you. As chainran of the Grievance
Cornmittee of the North' 'carolina state Bar,' it is naY my duty to, issue this
reprimand and I am' certain that you will urrlerstand fully the spirit in which
this duty is perfonned.
You represented Michael E. Seagroves in a divorce action against his
wife, Claudia Seagroves. Mr. Seagroves infonned you that he and
Mrs. Seagroves lived iri the same hoUse at the time that he claimed the parties
separated. However, you alleged in the Con'plaint for Absolute Divorce filed
on April 8, 1987 that Mr. and Mrs. Seagroves separated On or about March 26,
1986 and th,at they "haQ remained separate and apart since that time". At the
time the complaint was filed on April 8, 1987, the parties had not remained
separate and apart as they were living together in the same house.

However, in your response to the' Gri~ Connnitt$e, you indicated that .
. Mr'~' SeagrOves infonned you that he and. his wife had not "rE;!CJUl,arly" Slept .
. together nor was Mr. Seagroves involved .with Mrs. SeagroVes; "rdmarttically or
otherwise on a regular day to day' basis" •

.

'!he Grievance Cormnittee was concemed that tlle pleadings you filed on "
, Pellalf of Mr. Seagroves were misleacii.rg and. did not affinnatively disclose ~ll'
the facq; pertaining to the Seagroves' separation. '!he case law at tl)e time
of th~ filing of the divorce corrplaint established that ~paration meant the
.' ceSsation of cohabitation. Cohabitation was defined by North Cqrblina case
'law as living together as man and. wife, inclucUng the parties' ;involvement in
sexual relations. You have in:l:j.cateci that you knew that Mr. arid Mrs.
'
Seagroves had sexual relations on a irregular basiS and w~e mvolved
romantically, albeit irregularly.
" ,
'Your conduct violated Rule 1. 2 (C) and. (D) of the RuleS of Professional
Conduct. As an officer of the court, you have an ethical opligation to be
, ¢omple1;:ely truthful with the court'. All faqtual c:i,rcurn:;;-qmces must ~ ,
