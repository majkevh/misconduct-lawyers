WILLIAM A. GRAHAM,
ATTORNEY AT LAW

REPRIMAND

I

On July 16, 1992, the Grievance Committee of ,the North Carolina
State Bar met and con'sidered the grieva'nce filed, against you by
Tammy G. Andrews.
Pursuant ,to section, 13 (A) of article"IX of the Rules and
Regulations of the North Carolina ,State Bar, the Grievance
Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. ,After considering the
information available to it, including your response to the
letter of notice, the Grievance Committee found probable c~use.
'Probable cause is defined in the rules as IIreasonable cause to
believe 'that a member of the North Carolina state Bar is guilty
of misconduct justifying disciplinary action. 1I
The rules provide :that aft.er a finding of probable ,cause, the
,Grievance committee, may determine that th~ filing of a complaint
ahd" a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing Commission are not
required and the Grievance Committee may issue,various levels of
discipline dependi.rig upon t.he ,misconduct, the actual or potential
injury caused, qnd any aggravating or mitigating factors. The
Grievance Committee may issue an admonition, reprimqnd, or
censure to the respondent attorney. '
A reprimand is a written form of discipline more serious than an
admonition issued in cases in w~ich an attorney-nas violated one
or more provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct and has
caused harm or potential harm to a client, the administration of
justice, the profession, or a member of the public, but the
misconduct does'not. require a censure.

I.

,~

The Grievance C,9mmittee was of the opinion,that a censure is not
required in this case and issues this reprimand to you. As
chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina state
Bar, it is now my duty to issue this reprimand and I'am certain
thClt you will understand fully the spirit in which this duty is
performed.

The Committee found that you initially represented Frank Baldwin
in an action against his wife concerning divorc~ from bed and
board, alimony, custody and support. Thereafter, Tamm~ Andrews
asked you to assist ,her with a claim against Mr., Baldwln for
child support. YOll, informed Ms. Andrews that if she ,intended to
pursue Frank'Bald~in for support of this child, she would have to
seek other counsel to do so. The reason you gave for declining
representation was because you were in a conflict position
between her and Fl;Clnk Baldwin. However, after r,eferring Ms.
Andrews to another attorney, you offered to help 'Ms. Andrews and
