claiming that Cardinal Building (i) "made false representations outside of eontraet, to
Defendants [the Ostrowskis] as to necessary expertise, competency, resourees and
abilities to properly perform the eonstruetion services for this large investment by
Defendants [the Ostrowskis] in this high-end 'AI Platt' home" and (ii) that these

negligence alleging that Cardinal Building "grossly breached these duties [of professional
care] by grossly, recklessly and/or intentionally performing significantly deficient
construction services as specifically stated herein and did so with gross, reckless andlor
intentional disregmd to Plaintiffs [sic] and their property."
27. Defendant claimed that "these gross breaches of duties, were each proximate
causes of significant damages to Defendants [the Ostrowskis] in an amount in excess of
$ I0,000 and entitle Defendants [the Ostrowskis] to punitive damages."
28. The arbitration panel concluded that the allegations of gross negligence as
pled did not support punitive damages and therefore treated tile allegations of gross
negligence as claims of simple negligence.
29. The evidence did not show that Cardinal Building was grossly negligent and
the evidence did not support the imposition of punitive damages on a gross negligence
theory.
30. Defendant's claim for punitive damages on a theory of gross negligence was
without basis in fact and was frivolous.

39. On 10 April 2007, Cmdinal Building responded to the Ostrowskis'
counterclaims with a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12 of the North Carolina Rules
of Civil Procedure.
40. On 3 May 2007, Defendant filed on behalf of the Ostrowskis a Motion for
Default pursuant to Rule 55 of the North Cmolina Rules of Civil Procedure.
41. The 10 April 2007 motion to dismiss previously liled by Cardinal Building
changed the time period for Cardinal Building to file its answer. Pursuant to N.C. Rule
of Civil Procedure 12(a)(1), instead of having 30 days from service to file its answer to
the counterclaims, Cardinal Building had 20 days from notice of the court's action on its
motion to dismiss within which to file an answer.
42. At the time Defendant filed the Motion for Default, no action had yet been
taken on Cardinal Building's motion to dismiss and hence the time for Cardinal Building
to answer the counterclaims had not yet expired. Therefore, Cardinal Building had not
yet failed to plead in response to the counterclaims as required for default judgment under
Rule 55 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.
43. Defendant's Motion for Default was frivolous and without basis in law and
fact.
44. Defendant lmowingly disregmded N. C. Rule of Civil Procedure 55 when she
liled the Motion for Default on behalf of the Ostrowskis.
45. In or about May 2007, Defendant informed the court and opposing counsel of
her need to restrict her court appearances for medical reasons.
46. After sending this initial communication, Defendant instructed her nonlawyer assistant to send to the court copies of letters from her medical providers in
support of her efforts to have cases removed or withheld from the upcoming trial
calendar. Defendant instructed her non-lawyer assistant to send these letters from
medical providers without copying opposing counsel on the transmittal letter to the court.
47. Defendant also instructed her non-lawyer assistant to contact the trial court
administrator on her behalf seeking to confirm that no hearings would be scheduled in the
Lawsuit (as well as other pending matters in which Defendant represented a party).
48. Defendant's ofJice had this email communication with the trial court
administrator without copying opposing counsel on this communication and therefore
without giving opposing counsel notice and oppOliunity to be heard on the issue of
scheduling in the Lawsuit.
49. On 20 Februmy 2007 Cardinal Building Jiled a motion for sanctions in
arbitration alleging that Cardinal Building had been unfairly prejudiced by the
Ostrowskis' failure to timely designate an arbitrator.

-5-

50. Cm'dinal Building's motion for sanctions in arbitration was denied.
51. On 21 May 2007, Cardinal Building filed a motion for sanctions against
Defendant and her clients under N.C. Rule of Civil Procedure 11 alleging that Defendant
frivolously filed a Motion for Default.
52. On 17 July 2007, Cm-dinal Building filed a motion for smlctions under N.C.
Rule of Civil Procedure 11 alleging that Defendant frivolously filed a Motion for More
Definitive Statcment.
53. Counsel for Cardinal Building informed Defendant that he would havc
Cardinal Building's motions for sanctions hem-d at the close of arbitration.
54. On 18 December 2007, Cardinal Building filed an "Objection and Motion for
Sanctions in Arbitration" with the arbitration panel.
55. Cardinal Building's Objection and Motion for Smlctions included a list of all
of the events that provided the bases for the motions for sanctions that Cardinal Building
had previously filed as well as those events that provided the bases for a motion for
sanctions that Cardinal Building had yet to file. Although this pleading included the list
of all of Defendant's conduct that Cardinal Building argued supported the imposition of
smlctions, Cardinal Building limited its sanction request in the Objection and Motion for
Sanctions to a request for sanctions for Defendant's failure to organize and index the
Ostrowskis' m-bitration hearing exhibits.
56. The arbitration panel denied Cardinal Building's Objection and Motion for
Sanctions in Arbitration.
57. The arbitration panel also ruled on other requests for sanctions and attorncys'
fees.
58. The arbitration panel denied all requests made to it for at10rneys' fees and
sanctions.
59. On 17 March 2008, Cardinal Building filed another motion for sanctions
against both Defendant and the Ostrowskis pursuant to N.C. Rule of Civil Procedure II
and N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 1D-45 for: filing a frivolous pleading in response to the complaint,
making unfounded and frivolous objections to arbitration and m'bitrator, unfounded and
lJ'ivolous purported joinder of third party defendants, unfounded and frivolous motion for
entry of default, and unfounded and frivolous motion for more definitive statement.
60. Counsel for Cardinal Building requested hearing on its various motions for
sanctions.
61. Defendant Jilecl a brief in response to Cardinal Building's 17 March 2008
motion for sanctions.

-6-

62. In her brief, Defendant represented to the court that all of the issues raised by
Cardinal Building in its motions for sanctions had "already been heard and adjudicated
and denied." Defendant made similar representations at a 31 March 2008 hearing before
the Honorable J. Marlene Hyatt.
63. There was evidence to suppOli Defendant's statements that Cardinal
Building's motions for sanctions had already been heard and denied because the
arbitrators considered the issues that were raised in Cardinal Building's motions for
sanctions when they considered Cardinal Building's Objection and Motion for Sanctions
in Arbitration.
64. At the 31 March 2008 hearing on Cardinal Building's motions for sanctions,
Defendant bombarded the court with documents and arguments that did not address the
issue of which requests for sanctions had already been heard and denied by the arbitration
panel. Defendant failed to direct the cOUli to that evidence that showed that requests for
attorneys' fees and sanctions had been previously heard and denied by the arbitration
panel.
65. Defendant failed to provide the court with the evidence that showed that
requests for attorneys' fees and sanctions had been previously heard and denied by the
arbitration panel though this evidence existed and was Imown to Defendant at the time of
the hearing before Judge Hyatt.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
I. All parties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the Panel has jurisdiction
over Defendant, JeaIUle Plowden Hall, and over the subject matter.
2. Defendant's conduct, as set forth in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes
grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 84-24(b)(2) in that Defendant
violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as follows:
a.

By representing to the court that certain motions for saIlctions had
already been "heard and adjudicated and denied" without
providing the court with any basis upon which to conclude that this
statement was true and instead bombarding the court with
documents and arguments that did not address this issue,
Defendant engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of
justice in violation of Rule 8A( d);

b.

By filing the Ostrowski pleading and by filing the 3 May 2007
Motion for Default, Defendant knowingly disobeyed all obligation
under the rules of the tribunal in violation of Rule 3 A( c) and
engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in
violation of Rule 8A(d);

-7-

c.

By asserting defenses and counterclaims without basis in fact and
by filing a Motion for Default, Defendant brought a proceeding
and asserted and controverted an issue therein that was frivolous
and without a basis in law and fact in violation of Rule 3.1; and

d.

By instructing her non-lawyer assistant to have written
communication with the court without simultaneously providing a
copy to opposing counsel and by causing the tlial court
administrator to be contacted on her behalf without copying
opposing counsel, Defendant commlll1icated ex parle with a judge
or other official in violation of Rule 3.5(a)(3), was responsible for
the conduct of her non-lawyer assistant in violation of Rule 5.3(c),
and failed to make reasonable efforts to ensure that her non-lawyer
assistant's conduct was compatible with Defendant's professional
obligations in violation of Rule 5.3(b).

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the Hearing
Panel enters the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. Defendant's clients' legal fees were needlessly increased by Defendant's
misconduct.
2. The length of time required to litigate the Lawsuit was needlessly extended by
Defendant's misconduct.
3. Defendant's misconduct resulted in court resources being diverted away from
hearing the disputes of the parties and those of pm-ties to other litigation matters so that
the issue of whether Defendant should be sanctioned could be heard.
4. Judge Hyatt entered an order against Defendant and her clients and awm-ded
Cardinal Building $30,000 in sanctions.
5. The Ostrowskis sold the house that was the subject of the Lawsuit. The
closing lawyer maintained in escrow a pOliion of the sales proceeds from the sale of the
Ostrowskis' house for use to satisfy the sanction award in order to protect the buyers of
the house 11Â·om any potential claim that the sanction award constituted a lien on the
housc. The closing lawyer paid the $30,000 sanction award from the funds he held in
escrow for the Ostrowskis.
6. Defendant did not reimburse the Ostrowskis for their payment of the sanction
award though she states that discounts that she gave the Ostrowskis on their legal fees
were given to offset their payment of sanctions.

-8-

7. At the conclusion of the Lawsuit, the Ostrowskis' faith in the legal system was
greatly diminished as a result of Defendant's misconduct.
8. Defendant's primary care physician diagnosed Defendant with post traumatic
stress disorder in May 2007. It is unclear whether Defendant still suffers from this
disorder.
9. Defendant has no prior discipline.
10. Dcfend,mt cooperated with the State Bar during its investigation and
prosecution of this case.

Bascd on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Findings of
Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following:

CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I. The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the dilIerent forms of

discipline available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure and suspension. In
addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27 N.C.A.C. lB
Â§ .01 14(w)(l) of the Rules mld Regulations of the State Bar and finds that the following
factors warrant suspension of Defendant's license:
a.

negative impact ofthe defendant's actions on clients' and
public's perception of the profession;

b.

impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the
representation;

c.

negative impact of the defendant's actions on the administration
ofjustice; and

d.

efIect of defendmlt's conduct on third pm-ties.

2. The I-Iearing Panel has also considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. JB Â§ .01 14(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar
and concludes no factors are present in this instance that would warrant disbarment.
3. The Hearing Panel has also considered all ofthe factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. lB Â§ .01 14(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the NOlih Carolina State Bar
and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
a.

pattern of misconduct;

-9-

b. multiple offenses;
c. experience in the practice oflaw;
d. the absence of prior disciplinary offenses; and
e. full and free disclosure to the Hearing Panel and cooperative attitude
toward the proceedings.
4. Defendant's conduct caused harm to her clients by needlessly increasing the
length and cost of her clients' defense ofthe Lawsuit.
5. Defendant's conduct caused harm to her clients because it provided a basis for
sanctions to be imposed against Defendant and her clients, which sanctions were paid by
her clients.
6. Defendant's conduct caused significant harm to the legal profession in that her
actions bring the legal profession into disrepute.
7. The I-Iearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and finds that a censure,
reprimand or admonition would be insufficient discipline because of the negative effect
of Defendant's misconduct on the administration of justice, the harm to Defendant's
clients and the potential harm to the legal profession caused by Defendant's conduct.
8. The I-Iearing Panel finds that discipline short of suspensIOn would not
adequately protect the public for the following reasons:
a.

Defendant's conduct caused significant harm to the
administration of justice by diverting court resources away from
hearing her clients' matter and other litigants' matters so that
the issue of whether Defendant should be sanctioned could be
considered; and

b.

Entry of an order imposing less severe discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the misconduct and would send
the wrong message to attorneys and the public about the
conduct expected of members of the Bar of this State.

9. The Hearing Panel finds and concludes that the public will be adequately
protected by suspension of Defendant's law license, stayed with conditions imposed upon
Defendant designed to ensure protection of the public and Defendant's continued
compliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct.

-10-

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Findings of Fact
