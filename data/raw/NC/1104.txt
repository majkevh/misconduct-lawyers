Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following
CONCLUSlONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearing Panel carefully considered all of the different fOlms of discipline
available to it.
2.
The Hearing Panel considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code 1B § .0114(w)(1), (2) and (3) of the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar and concluded
that the following factors are applicable:
27 N.C. Adlnin. Code. lB § .0114(w)(1)

Proper maintenance and management of entrusted tlmds is a cornerstone of the
3.
public'S trust in the legal profession. Embezzlement is one of the most serious offenses an
attorney can commit, betraying the client's tmst in the attol11ey and the public's trust in the legal
profession. Defendant's misappropriation caused harm to the standing of the legal profession,
undelmining tmst and confidence in lawyers and the legal system.
7

4.
Defendant's failure to properly collect and pay over withheld taxes, designated by
statute to be a special fund in trust for the United States and in a malUler causing significant hal1n
and potential halm to her employees, caused significant potential hahn to the standing of the
legal profession. Furthermore, Defendant's extended failure to comply with tax obligations, both
as an individual and as an employer, for a period of many years, causes substantial hann to the
standing of the legal profession.
5.
The Hearing Panel considered all of the disciplinary options available to it and
determined that disbannent is appropriate.
6.
The Hearing Panel has considered all lesser sanctions and finds that discipline
short of disbmment would not adeqnately protect the public for the following reasons:
a.

Defendant engaged in misconduct constituting felonies and violations of
the trust of her clients, employees, and the public;

b.

Entry of an order imposing 'less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Defendant committed and
would send the wrong message to attomeys and the public regarding the
conduct expected of members of the Bar oftbis State; and

c.

The protection of the public and the legal profession requires that
Defendant not be pennitted to resume the practice of law until she
demonstrates the following: that she has refonned; tbat she understands
her obligations to her clients, the public, the courts, and the legal
profession; and that reinstatement will not be detrimental to the public or
the integrity and standing of the legal profession. Disbarred lawyers are
required to make such a showing before they may resume praCticing law,
whereas no such showing of refonnation is required of attorneys whose
licenses are suspended.

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and additional Findings of
Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel hereby enters the
foHowing
