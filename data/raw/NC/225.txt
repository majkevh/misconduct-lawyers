TO:

The Council of The North Carolina State Bar

I, John P. Siskind, hereby tender my license to practice and desire to resign from The
North Carolina State Bar. My resignation is tendered freely and voluntarily, is not the result
of coercion or duress, and I am fully aware of the implications of submitting the resignation.
I am aware that there are presently pending investigations or other proceedings regarding
allegations that I have been guilty of misconduct, to wit: mishandling of fiduciary funds
entrusted to me in violation of Canon I and Canon X of the Rules of Professional Conduct in
the matters of Ralph N. Colvard and the Estate of Thomas Westbrook.
I acknowledge that the material facts upon which the complaints are predicated are true.
I am submitting my resignation because I know that, if charges were predicated upon the
misconduct under investigation, I could not successfully defend against them.

This the 18th day of May, 1992.

JOHN P. SISKIND
Subscribed and sworn to before me this the 18th day of May, 1992.
