At its regular quatterlymeeting on Oct'obet 22, 1986., the Grievance
Committee of the North Carolina State Bar c6ndu<;ted a preliminary hearing
under Section 13 of the Discipline and' Disbarment Rules of· the Nor~h Carolina

Committee considered all of the evidence before it, including your written

Disb~rment Rules, the Committee fQund probable cause.
Probable cause is
de·fined under the Discipline and Disbarmen,t Rules. as.: "A finding by the
Grievance Committee that there is reasonable cause to believe that a member of
the North Carolina State ~ar is guil·ty of m·iscondQ,ct justifying disc'iplinary

I

As Chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar,
it is now my duty to issue th:f,.s PU'blic Censure and t am certain that you
urtderstand fully the spirit: in which this duty is performed, tha·t you will
understand the censure, and appreciate its significance. .The fact that a
public censure is no·t the most serious discipline that· may be imposed by the
North Catolina State Bar should not be taken by you to indicate that any
member of the COminittee feels that your cond:uct waS excusable or less t.ha:n a
serious and substantial violation of the Code o'f Professional Resp0'tlsibility.
You represent Wilson D. Wom~le in a personal injury action arising out of
an accident that occurred on November 21, 1979. Mr. Womble was a passenger in
his wife's automobile at the time of the accident. When settlement
negotiations were unsuccessful, you filed a lawsUit on Mr. Womble's behalf on
November 19, 1982. You Were successful in baving Mr. Womble's wife served
with the complaint, but were unsuccessful in having the Jones's, driver and
owner of the vehicle that .rear-ended the vehicle in which Mr. Womble was a
passenger, served with summon's and a copy of the complaint. You failed to
have the original summon's endorsed or have alias and pluries-summons's issued
within 90 days as requried to continue the lawsuit in existence against the
Jones's. Mr. Homble's wife was granted summary judgment on November 1, 1983.
A Judgment of Discontinuance was entered on November 4, 1983 as a result of
the Jones's not being served with summon's and without any extension of
