15

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Additional Findings
of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE
L
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27 N.C.A.C. IB
§ .OlI4(w)(I), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar, and concludes that the following
factors are present:
a. intent of the defendant to connnit acts where the harm or potential harm
was foreseeable;
b. circumstances reflecting the defendant's lack of honesty, trustworthiness,
or integrity;
c. elevation of the defendant's own interest above that of the client;
d. the negative impact of the defendant's actions on the administration of
justice;
e. impairment of clients' ability to achieve the goals of the representation;
f.

acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication; and,

g. multiple instances offailure to participate in the legal profession'S selfregulation process.
2.
TIle Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
IB § .OlI4(w)(2), the Rules and Regulations ofthe State Bar, and concludes that acts of
dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, fabrication, misappropriation, and commission of
felonies are present in this case, and that these factors warrant disbannent in order to protect
the public.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
1B § .OI14(w)(3), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar, and concludes that the
following factors are applicable in this matter:
a. lack of timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify the
consequences of her conduct;
b. dishonest or selfish motive;
c. pattern of misconduct;
d. multiple offenses;
e. lack of cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings;

16

f.

bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceedings by failing to comply
with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency;

g. refusal to aclmowledge wrongful nature of her conduct;
h. the vulnerability of the victims; and,
1.

Arnold's significant experience in the practice oflaw.

4.
Amold' s failure to respond to the State Bar and failure to participate in the
disciplinary process caused ham1 to the legal profession by interfering with the State Bar's
ability to regulate attomeys and by undelmining the privilege oflawyers in this State to
remain self-regulating.
5.
Arnold's conduct caused significant ham1 or potential significant harm to her
clients, the administration of justice and the legal profession in that her actions bring the legal
profession into disrepute.
6.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser altematives and finds that discipline
short of disbarment would not adequately protect the public for the following reasons:
a) Arnold committed misdeeds involving moral turpitude and violations of her
clients' trust, including fraudulent conduct, material misrepresentations,
misappropliations of entrusted funds, ar1d deceit. Misconduct involving
misappropriation and dishonesty are among the most serious that an attomey can
commit. Such offenses demonstrate that the offending attomey is not trustworthy.
Clients are entitled to have trustworthy attomeys;
b) Arnold repeatedly engaged in criminal acts reflecting adversely on her honesty,
trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer, and engaged in abuses oftrust by
misappropriating funds entrusted to her;
c) EnlIy of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to acknowledge
the seriousness of the offenses Amold conm1itted and would send the wrong message
to attomeys and the public regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar of
this State; and,
d) The protection of the public and the legal profession requires that Amold not
be permitted to resume the practice of law until she demonstrates the following: that
she has refom1ed; that she understands her obligations to her clients, the public, and
the legal profession; and, that permitting her to practice law will not be detrimental to
the public or the integrity and standing of the legal profession or the administration of
justice. Disbarred lawyers are required to malce such a showing before they may
resume practicing law.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Additional Findings
of Fact Regarding Discipline, and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the Hearing
Panel hereby enters the following:

17
