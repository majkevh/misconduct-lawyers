37.
Crew knowingly and willfully converted and embezzled the $22,000.00
she held in trust for Philpot.

Based on the record and the foregoing Findings of Fact, the hearing panel
makes the following
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.
All the parties are properly before the hearing panel and the panel has
jurisdiction over Defendant, Tonya J. Crew, and the subject matter.
2.
Crew's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes
grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(2) as follows:
(a)	

By willfully, and knowingly converting the $22,000.00 which she was
holding in trust for the benefit of Philpot, and by utilizing those funds for
her own personal benefit without authorization from Philpot, Crew used
entrusted property for her personal benefit without authorization, in
violation of Rule 1.15-2(j); engaged in criminal conduct, embezzlement,
that reflects adversely on her honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness to
practice, in violation of Rule 8A(b); and engaged in conduct involving
fraud, deceit, dishonesty, or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8A(c);
and

(b)	

By falsely representing to the State Bar that she had escheated the
$22,000.00 to the State of North Carolina and falsely representing to the
State Bar that account #2886 75 was opened by an office worker without
her knowledge, Crew engaged in conduct involving fraud, deceit,
dishonesty, or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8 A( c) and knowingly
made a false statement of material fact in connection with a disciplinary
matter in violation of Rule 8.1(a).

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and the
additional evidence regarding discipline presented at the hearing, the hearing panel
hereby finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following additional

FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.	

Crew's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
a.	

Prior disciplinary offenses, to wit, a 2007 Admonition;

b.	

Dishonest or selfish motive;

4


c.

A pattern of misconduct:

d.	

Multiple offenses;

e.	

The submission of false statements during the disciplinary process;

f.	

Refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct;

g.	

Indifference to making restitution; and

h.
Issuance of a letter of warning to the defendant within the three
years preceding the filing of the complaint.
2.	

Crew's misconduct is mitigated by the following factor:
a.	

3.	

Physical impairment;

The aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factor.

4.
Crew's actions caused significant actual hann to her client in that her
misappropriation of the $22,000.00 which she was holding in trust for the benefit of
Philpot:
a.	

Deprived Philpot of funds to which Philpot was entitled, resulting
in significant financial harm to Philpot; and

b.	

Continues to constitute financial harm to Philpot, in that Crew has
failed to make restitution to Philpot.

5.
Crew's actions caused significant actual harm to the profession, in that the
public in her community is aware of her misconduct. Such publicity erodes public
confidence in attorneys, tends to sully the reputation of, and fosters disrespect for, the
profession as a whole.
6.
The hearing panel has considered lesser alternatives and finds that a public
censure or reprimand would not be sufficient discipline because of the gravity of the
actual harm to her client and to the legal profession caused by Defendant's conduct, and
the threat of significant potential harm Defendant poses to the public and to potential
future clients.
7.
The hearing panel has considered lesser sanctions and finds that discipline
short of disbarment would not sufficiently protect the public for the following reasons:
a.	

Crew's continuing course of multiple offenses;

b.	

Crew's pattern of dishonesty and deceit;

5


c.	

Crew's refusal to appreciate or acknowledge the wrongful nature
of her misconduct;

d.	

Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Crew committed and
would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public
regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar of this
State.

8.
The hearing panel therefore finds that the only sanction in this case that
can adequately protect the public is Crew's disbarment.
9.
The expenses incurred by Plaintiff for stenographic and videographic
assistance in the taking of depositions in this matter and the cost of those deposition
transcripts were reasonable and necessary in the litigation of this case. The cost of those
depositions should be taxed to Defendant.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and additional
Findings of Fact and Conclusions Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel hereby enters
the following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

1.

Defendant, Tonya J. Crew, is hereby DISBARRED from the practice of

law.
2.
Defendant shall surrender her license and membership card to the
Secretary of the North Carolina State Bar no later than 30 days following service of this
order upon Defendant.
3.
Defendant shall pay the costs of this proceeding as assessed by the
Secretary of the North Carolina State Bar, including DHC costs and including costs of the
transcription and depositions taken in this case as follows: court reporter costs;
videographer and videotaping costs; transcription costs; shipping, handling, and
transmittal costs; and witness costs. Defendant must pay the costs within 30 days of
service upon her of the statement of costs by the Secretary.
4.
