requested a Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) permit which would
allow'their exis'ting pier to be extended trom 86 feet to 150 feet
in length and increase ,the number of boat slips f+om six to
eighteen.
6.
By letter dated February 5, 1988, the Division of Coastal
Management (OCM) denied the Silverthornes' permit application
citing anticipated adverse impacts on water qua'lity and resulting
closqre of shellfish'wat~rs in the vicinity of the proposed
project.

1

7. on or about February 12, 1988, the Silverthornes
discussed their matter with aarker who made phone calls on their
behaif trying 'to r~solve th~ matter through negotiation.
8. On or about March '10, 1988,' the SilverthorneS retained
Barker,to represent them in appealing the denial of their permit
application by DCM.
9.
By petition filed March 14, 1988 with the Office of
Administrative Hearings (OAH), Barker appealed the denial of the
Silverthornes' application for a CAMA permit by the OCM.
10.
By letter 'dated March 22, 1988 to Preston Pate,
assistant director of OCM, Barker confirmed an agreement they had
reached by telephone that day to the effect that the
Silverthornes would submit an amended application for a ten slip
permit and, when granted, would withdraw the appeal previously
filed in the OAH.
11. A June 3, 1988 letter from DCM to Mr. Silverthorne
indicated that the ten slip permit was enclosed and if
Silverthorne signed the ten slip permit it meant he had waived
his right of appea+.

1

12. Barker subsequently had another Client, Nicholas J.
Santoro, whose app+ication to,DCM for a 61 slip permit on Browns
,Cree~ in Whortonsville was denied on July 22, 1988.
Santoro
app~aled the denial of his permit.
~n December, 1988, Santoro
was granted a ten slip permit by oeM without having to give up
his appeal.

_.

'13. As a result of the statement to Mr. Silverthorne about
dropping his appeal contained in the June 3, 19~8 letter and the
perceived Change in policy by DCM based upon OeM allowing Santoro
to have a ten slip permit without dropping his appeal, Ba+ker
became convinced his clients, the silverthornes, had ,been treated
unfairly by DCM.
14.
By letter9 dated July 5, 1988 and September 19, 1988, an
agency legal specialist for DCM, David G. Heeter (Heeter)
requested Barker to dismiss the petition in the OAH.
Barker took
ho action to do so.
15. On August 16, 1989, Heeter filed a motion for summary
judgment in the OAH contending that the March 22, 1988 settlement
had made the appeal of the 18 slip permit denial moot.

i6. On November 21, 1989, a 'hearing 'was, conducted in Pamlico
County, North Carolina before Acting Chi~f Administrative ,:Law
Judge Beeche~ R •. Gray (Gray) on the motion fOl; summa~y Judgment'.
Barker's content10n was that the agreement to drpp tpe appeal,was
cgerged by OCM and that the agreement was voi4 fo;r laclt ot '
cons1deration and violated public policy.
"
17 •
In his argument to Gray, Barker s'tated that he had a
conversation with Gray'~' predecessor, former Coief Adm~nistrative
Law,J~dge Robert A. Melott, who C;ldvised him to agree to drop the'
appeal to get the ten slip permit becaus~ ,Melottq~d not r~gard '
such an agreement as having any legal effect.
'
'
,

I

: 18.
Barker stated this knowing that he had not sought·'
Mel..ott's advice on the agreement entered into by J;3arker n6x; na,d
he :received any advice abc;nit the agreement f'rom Me,:J.ott, ei.ther
'before or after th~ agreement was entered into by Ba'rker on;
behalf of his clients.
,
19. Gray denied the motion for summary j~dgment and heard
the contested case on the merits of the silverthornes' permit
appeaL. Gray subsequently issued a Recommended I;>~cisionho;l.ding
tn-at the OCM had failed to show there were suffioient, oyste·rs' in
Brown Creek to justify denying the Silverthorne's application for
,a CAMApermit for 18 slips.
'
20.. 'The matte:r:- was next heard by the Coastal 'Resq,urces,
commission' (ORC) on December 7, 1990..

21.
In his argument to the commissioners of the CRC,B'arker
again argued that the March 22, 1988 agreement to drop the appeai
was coerced. He stated that he advised Melott what was
"
,happening,' thC;lt. M'elottadvised 'him how t9 proceed,; and, :~pat thC;lt
is how he pr6ceeded~
"
'
22. When ,asked by Commissioner Tomlinson whether the
administrative law judge (Melott) recomm~nded th~t pe renege on
the agreement, Barker answered that Melott advised him tha~ the
ag,reement would be of no (orce and effect, that it was' coepced
and would not be binding, and that he (Melott) would not,tiphpld
it.

I

23.. Commissioner Besse asked whether Melott in fact advi,sed
Barker in'an ex 1?artecommunication to tender a settl~mentoffe;r
which he had no 1ntention of complying with. Bal;,ke,r C).n~w~r~d", '
"yes."
24.
Barker had occasions to hear Melott discuss his views on
coerced settlements' on several occasions;,.' However, J,3arke'l;l1ad
not discussed the'Silverthornes' matter with Melott and had not
gotten ~my advice from ,Melott about how he- shouid 'proceed ':En ,
representing the Silverthornes.

25. sin<;::e Barker had no specific conversation"swith H~lott
about pis clients' matter with'oeM, his statementpto the ,
commiss;ioners C!;bout having bad such conversi;\tions and ;rel,atirfg
Melott's alleged advice' were misrepresentations.

BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact, the hearing'
. committee concludes as a matter of law that Barker's conduct
constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N. C., Gen. Stat.
S~c. 84-28(b) (2) .in that the Defendant, Bill Barker, violated the
RUles of Professional Conduct as follows:
By making statements to Acting Chief Administrative
Law Judge Beecher R. Gray during the course' of a
hearing that he had a conversation with Gray's
predecessor, Robert A. Melott, who advised him to
agree to drop the appeal to get the ten slip permit
because Melott did not regard such an agreement to
have any legal effeCt when he had not had such a
conv~rsation with Melott and Melott had of~ered no
advice on the matter, Barker engaged 'in conduct
involving_misrepr~sentation in violation of Rule
1.2 (C.) . and knowingly made a false statement of fact
in violation of Rule 7.2(A) (4).

a)

b)

By making statements to the commissioners. of the
CRC that he had been advised by Melott about the
effect of the agreement and whether Melott would
uphold it, when no such conversation had occurred
with Melott and Melott had offered no such advice,
Barker engaged in conduct involving
misr~presentation in violation of Rule 1.2(C) and
knowingly made a false statement of fact in
violation of Rule 7.2(A) (4).

c)

The conclusion that Barker's misleading statements
to Gray and to the commissioners of the CRC during
his ~rgument in the Silve~thornes' case violated
Rule 7.2(A) (4) is supported by the comment to that
rule which states:

1

I'

However, an assertion purporting to be of the
lawyer's own knowledge, as in an affi<;lavit by
:the lawyer or in a statement in open court,
may properly be made only when the lawye~
knows the ass.ertion is true or believes it to
true on the basis of a reasonably diligent
•inquiry.

'IN THE MATTER OF

BILL BARKER,
ATTORNEY AT LAW

CENSURE

)
)

I

This censure is delivered to you pursuant to section .23A(3)
of the Discipline and Disbarment Procedures of the North Carolina
'Hearing commission foilowing a hearing in the above captioned
proceeding on'April 3, 1992. At that'hearing,'the hearing
.committee found that you had violated various provisions of the
Rules of Professional Conduct of the No~th Carolina state Bar.
In representing your clients, the silverthornes, in
appealing the denial of a CAMA permit. for an eighteen slip dock
to be built in Brown Creek in the Whartonsville community in
Pamlico County, you represented to'Acting Chief Administrative
Law Judge Beecher R. Gray, on November 21, 1989, that you had
discussed the Silverthornes matter with former chief
Administrative Law Judge Robert A. Meiott. You further
represented that Melott advised you to agree to drop the appeal
in exchange for a i ten slip permit because Melott did not :r:egard
such an agreement as having any legal effect. You said this to
Judge Gray knowing that you had not sought Judge Melott's advice
about the agreement or gotten any advice from him.

t

I

When the permit appeal was heard before the Coastal
Resources Commission on December 7, 1990, you told the
commissioners that you had advised Melott what was happening in
the Silverthornes;' case, that Melott had advised you how to
proceed ·and that you had proceeded based upon his advice. You
made this argument . although you had not had any.specific
. conversation with Melott about the Silverthornes' matter and had
not received any adviqe from 'Melott in the matter.
Your statements in your arguments to Judge Gray and to the
Coastal ReSources Commission constituted misrepresentations in
violation of Rule 1.2(C) and constituted false statements of fact
in violation of Rule 7.2(A) (4).
In deciding to impose this censure, the hearing committee
considered your argument that you had heard Melott express his
general feeling about coerced settlement agreements in such
cases, and had not misrepresented his positio~ to Judge Gray or
to the Coastal Resources COmIliission. However, the hearing
committee's determination that your statements violated the rules
cited was based upon the comment to rule 7.2(A) (4) which reads:
Howeveri' an assertion purporting to be of the lawyer's.

Although the he~ring CODl,lllittee h~s chosen to imp6s:~ a

trusts that you will'considerthis censure, recognize theerro~s
that you have maqe,a.nd never again ~llow yourself to depart frQm

This censure.should serve as ~ strong remindeJ;' and ind'\.icement; for
you to weigh carefully in the future your responsibilitY.to the.
