NOW, THEREFORE, based upon such findings of-fact

Hearing Commission hereby

is~ues

the following Order of

Publ.ic e'en-sure to JacobW .. Todd, . Attorney:
Pursuant to Section 23 of the Discipline and
Disbarment Procedures of The North Carolina State B-ar this .
Ptlblic C.ensure i.s- delivered' to you.

YQuhave

b~en

foun,,'!. to·_

have violated the Code- of Professional Resp-onsibi;Lityof The.

I

North Carolina State Bar by a hearing committee of

the

Disciplinary Heari'flg Commis;;ion s-it.ting on March 24, 1.978.

.

.'

The fact that this Public Censure is not the most
serious of possible discipline provided for in General
Statutes 84-28, should not be taken by you to indicate that
The North Carolina State Bar in any way feels that your
conduct in this matter was excusable or was considered by
the members of the trial committee of the Disciplinary
Hearing Commission to be any less than a very serious and
substantial violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility.
In your:representation of your clients, Lee and
I

Barbara Dawson, you ,failed to maintain complete records of
the funds coming into yotJ.r possession to be held in trust for
them.

You failed to render an accounting to them of the

dis'bursements of the funds for medical expenses and your fee.
You failed to promptly pay to yotJ.r clients the funds that they
were rightfully entitled to receive because you failed to
maintain those

fu~ds

in your trust account.

Your conduct was

unprofessional.
Your conduct was prejudicial to the administration of
justice.

This conduct is a direct violation of the Code of

Professional Responsibility and in'addition is a reflection upon
you and the

entir~

Bar 'of this State.

It violated no't only

the letter but also the spirit of the Code of Professional
Responsibility of:The North Carolina State Bar.
conduct as is

,exp~cted

It was not such

,of a member of the legal profession.

It

brings discredit upon you and ,tends to place the courts of this
'State and your

fe~low

members of the Bar in disrepute and

furth~r

damages both in the eyes of the public.
Failure lof attorneys to represent clien,ts within
the law and within the bounds' of the Code of Professional
Responsibility is the most serious complaint against our
profession, and YQur ,failure' to account and mainta;i.n ,the funds
of Lee and Barbara Dawson was your error here.

You placed a

privilege that you hold as a lawyer to ,serve the, public in
serious jeopardy.
