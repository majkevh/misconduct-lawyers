This matter was heard on June 12 and 13,2008 by a Hearing Committee
of the Disciplinary Hearing Commission composed of F. Lane Williamson, Chair,
John B. Regan, and H. Dale Almond. Margaret Cloutier and Leanor Bailey
Hodge represented Plaintiff. Curtis C. Osborne represented Defendant. After
signing the initial Order in this matter, it came to the attention of the Chair that the

paragraph into another necessitating this Corrected Order. Based upon the
record and the evidence introduced at the hearing, the Hearing Committee by
clear, cogent and convincing evidence hereby makes the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT

3


15. Defendant caused a wire transfer of funds in the amount of $513.00 to
be made from her trust account to National City Bank on October 19, 2006.
These funds were used for the benefit of J&F Land Management, a business
owned and/or operated by Defendant's mother. The wire notation on
Defendant's bank statement references property at 12306 Mt. Overlook Road.
This property is located in Cleveland, Ohio and at the time of the wire transfer the

purpose were not earned fees or reimbursement for expenses paid on behalf of
clients, and were client funds to which Defendant was not entitled.

to be made from her trust account to National City Bank on November 14,2006.
These funds were used for the benefit of J&F Land Management, a business

Defendant's bank statement references property on East 1261h Street and East
142nd Street. These properties are located in Cleveland, Ohio, they were owned
by Defendant ten months prior to the wire transfer, and at the time of the wire
transfer were owned by Defendant's mother. The funds used for this purpose
were not earned fees or reimbursement for expenses paid on behalf of clients,
and were client funds to which Defendant was not entitled.
17. Defendant caused a wire transfer of funds in the amount of $850.00 to
be made from her trust account to First Charter Bank on November 22,2006.
These funds were used for the benefit of Louwanna Ball, an employee of

trust account for the benefit of Louwanna Ball. Defendant had previously written
checks made payable to Louwanna Ball from Defendant's operating account in
the amounts of $400.00 on October 11,2006, $800.00 on October 18,2006 and
$800.00 on November 2, 2006, all of which checks were labeled as "payroll."
The funds wired from Defendant's trust account to the benefit of Louwanna Ball
were not earned fees or reimbursement for expenses paid on behalf of clients,
and were client funds to which Defendant was not entitled.
18. During the relevant period Defendant disbursed from her trust account
funds for numerous clients in excess of the amount of funds deposited for the
benefit of those clients into the trust account.
19. The following are examples of instances where Defendant disbursed

from her trust account funds in excess of the amount of funds deposited for the

benefit of those clients:

(a) Defendant closed a residential real estate transaction for client T.

Baird. The settlement statement and disbursement summary/balance sheet for

the Baird transaction reflected cash to be paid by the buyer of $28,352.13 and

cash to be paid by the seller of $3,762.81. The actual cash deposited into the


4


trust account on behalf of the buyer was $28,141.13, a deficiency of $211.00,
and no cash was deposited into Defendant's trust account on behalf of the seller.
Defendant disbursed funds consistent with the items listed on the settlement
statement and disbursement summary/balance sheet as if the cash deposits had
been made. As a result, Defendant disbursed $3,973.81 more for this
transaction than she deposited.
(b) Defendant closed a residential real estate transaction for client V.
Bradley. The settlement statement and disbursement summary/balance sheet
for the Bradley transaction reflected cash to be paid by the buyer of $188.75. No
cash was deposited into Defendant's trust account on behalf of the buyer.
Defendant disbursed funds consistent with the items listed on the settlement
statement and disbursement summary/balance sheet as if the cash deposit had
been made. As a result, Defendant disbursed $188.75 more for this transaction
than she deposited.
(c) Defendant closed a residential real estate transaction for client A.
Branson. The settlement statement and disbursement summary/balance sheet
for the Branson transaction reflected payment to be paid from the transaction
funds to Litton Loan Servicing in the amount of $130,833.99 to payoff the
existing note and deed of trust encumbering the property. Defendant disbursed
$131,022.81 to Litton Loan Servicing. As a result, Defendant disbursed $188.82
more for this transaction than she deposited.
20. By disbursing from her trust account funds for clients in excess of the
amount of funds deposited into the trust account for said clients, Defendant
misappropriated entrusted funds held in a fiduciary capacity for other clients.
21. Defendant closed a residential real estate transaction for client Sylvia
Hendley on or about November 15, 2006. In accordance with the settlement
statement for the Hendley transaction, Defendant deposited $267,409.03 into her
trust account, an amount sufficient to meet all of the disbursement obligations
contained on the settlement statement. Defendant was obligated to remit
$217,433.74 to Countrywide Home Loans on or near the closing date to satisfy
the existing note and deed of trust encumbering the property in the name of the
sellers, Horace and Stephanie Moore.
22. Defendant delayed making the $217,433.74 payment to Countrywide
Home Loans until November 28, 2006. On that date, the actual balance of client
funds in Defendant's trust account was insufficient to meet Defendant's obligation
to payoff the existing note and deed of trust. On November 28, 2006 Defendant
remitted $117,433.74 by wire transfer to Bank of America for the benefit of
Countrywide Home Loans. Countrywide Home Loans rejected the tender of
payment because it did not pay the loan in full and the funds were wired back
into Defendant's trust account on December 5, 2006.

5

23. As of December 29, 2006, Defendant's trust account should have had
a balance of $243,180.86 belonging to clients on whose behalf entrusted funds
had been deposited into Defendant's trust account.
24. As of December 29, 2006, Defendant's trust account had an actual
balance of $159,970.02 as a result of the activities described above.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Committee enters the
following
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. All parties are properly before the Hearing Committee, and the
Committee has jurisdiction over Defendant and the subject matter of this
proceeding.
2. Defendant's use of client funds to which she was not entitled for her
personal benefit by writing checks, making wire transfers, and making electronic
transfers from her trust account to her operating account satisfies the elements of
the crime of embezzlement.
3. Defendant's conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above,
constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C.G.S. §84-28(b)(2) in that
Defendant violated one or more of the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct in
effect at the time of the conduct as follows:
(a) by disbursing funds for clients in excess of the amount of funds
deposited for those clients in the trust account, Defendant used or pledged
entrusted property for the benefit of someone other than the legal or
beneficial owner of that property in violation of Rule 1.15.-2(a), 0), and
(m);
(b) by misappropriating entrusted funds to her own use and benefit,
Defendant committed a criminal act that reflects adversely on her honesty,
trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in violation of Rule 8.4(b), engaged in
conduct involving dishonesty fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in violation of
Rule 8.4(c), and used or pledged entrusted property for her personal benefit or
for the benefit of someone other than the legal or beneficial owner of that
property in violation of Rule 1.15.-20);
(c) by failing to reconcile her trust account at least quarterly, Defendant
failed to total and reconcile client balances with the current bank balance each
quarter in violation of Rule 1.15-3(c) in effect at the time of the conduct [now Rule
1.15-3(d)(1)].

,

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the
Hearing Committee also enters the following

FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1. As a result of the Defendant's misappropriation of client funds there
were insufficient funds to payoff the seller's original mortgage that encumbered
the property purchased by Defendant's client Ms. Hendley.
2. As a result of Defendant's failure to payoff the mortgage with the funds
entrusted to her by Ms. Hendley and the Moores, the Moores were forced to
continue to make monthly mortgage payments on the property purchased by Ms.
Hendley - a property the Moores no longer owned.
3. When the Moores could no longer afford to continue making mortgage
payments on the mortgage the Defendant failed to payoff in connection with the
closing, Ms. Hendley began receiving foreclosure notices and a foreclosure
action was instituted naming Ms. Hendley and the Moores as parties. A
foreclosure sale was scheduled and rescheduled several times before the matter
was resolved.
4. The Moores had to retain an attorney to represent them in connection
with their efforts to get the matter with the mortgage company resolved.
5. As a result of the fact that the Defendant failed to payoff the Moores'
original mortgage on the property purchased by Ms. Hendley, the Moores' credit
record has been negatively impacted. The negative impact to the Moores' credit
continues today.
6. Defendant's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
(a) dishonest or selfish motive;
(b) a pattern of misconduct;
(c) multiple offenses; and
(d) vulnerability of the victims.

7. Defendant's conduct is mitigated by the following factors:
(a) absence of a prior disciplinary record;

7

(b) personal or emotional problems regarding the illness of her
father; and
(c) inexperience in the practice of law.
8. The aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors.
9. The Hearing Committee finds and concludes that Defendant's conduct
caused significant harm to members of the public, the Moores, and potential
significant harm to her client, Ms. Hendley.
10. Defendant's conduct caused significant harm or potential signi"ficant
harm to the profession and to the public in that such conduct erodes the
confidence of the public in the trustworthiness of all lawyers. Ms. Hendley and
Ms. Moore expressed a sense of distrust of the legal profession in general due to
Defendant's conduct.
11. Defendant engaged in multiple violations of the Rules of
Professional Conduct over a substantial period of time. Her actions were not a
result of mistake nor appear to be an aberration, and it therefore appears that her
misconduct is the product of a character flaw that is not readily changeable.
12. The protection of the public requires that Defendant be disbarred and
that she not resume the practice of law until she demonstrates that she
understands the Rules of Professional Conduct and that she has reformed.
13. The Committee finds that entry of an order imposing a sanction less
than disbarment would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the offense
committed by Defendant, would be inadequate to protect th'e public, and would
send the wrong message to attorneys regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar in this State.
14. Depositions of two witnesses and the Defendant were taken by

Plaintiff and the expenses incurred by the Plaintiff for those depositions were

reasonable and necessary in the litigation of this case. The expense of the

depositions should be taxed to the Defendant.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and

Findings Regarding Discipline, all found by clear, cogent and convincing

evidence, the Hearing Committee enters the following:

ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1. The Defendant, Michelle V. Mallard, is hereby DISBARRED from the

practice of law in this state, effective 30 days from the 'date of service of this

order upon her.


8

,


2. Defendant shall surrender her law license and bar membership card
within 30 days after service of this order upon her.
3. Defendant shall comply with all provisions of 27 N.C.A.C. 1B §.0124 of
the North Carolina State Bar Discipline and Disability Rules as applicable.
4. Defendant is taxed with the costs of this action as assessed by the
Secretary, which costs shall include the cost of the depositions taken of the
witnesses and Defendant, and shall be paid within thirty (30) days of service of
the notice of costs upon the Defendant.

Signed by the undersigned Chair with the full kno~edge a~ent of
the other members of the Hearing Committee, this }/}'t day of
,

2008.
