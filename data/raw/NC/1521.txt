At its regular quarterly meeting on October' 21, 1987, the Grievance
Committee of the North Carolina State Bar conducted a preliminary hearing
under Section 13 of the Discipline and Disbarment Rules of the Nort.h Carolina
State Bar regarding the grievance filed against Y01,1 by tece-ipt of a copy of an
Order by Superior Court Judg,e Bradford Tillery,. The cOiru:nittee considered all
of the evidence before it. Pursuant to Section 13(10) of the Discipline and
pisbarment Rules, the Committee found, probable cause. 'Probable cause is
defined under the Discipline and DisbaI'ment Rule.s as: "A finding by the
Grievance Committee tha.t there is reasonable cause to believe that a member of
the North Car:01ina State Bar is guilty of misconduct jus-tifying disciplinary
action." The committee determined that a complaint and a heari-ng were not
warranted in this matter and the committee issued a Public Censure upon your
acceptance of it. The,refore, the committee issues ..this-Pub.l-ic Censure to
you.
As Chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Ba.r,
it is now my duty to is'sue this Public Censure and I am certain- that you
undet.s'tand fully the spirit in which this, duty is perfo-rmed, tha·t you will
t,lnder$tand the censure, and appreciate its significance. The, ~act that a
Public Ce'nsure is not the most serious discipline that may be imposed by the
North Carolina State Bar should not be taken by you to indicat'e that any
member of the committee feels that your conduct was excusable or less than a
serious and substantial violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.
You were appointed to represent Roger Lee Spurbeck at ·the trial of his
criminal cases in New Hanover Superior Court on or before November 14, 1985.
Spurbeck was convicted and r.eceived an active prison sentence. ~ou, filed
written notice of appeal to the North Carolina Court of Appeals in Spurbeck's
cases on November 14, 1985. You failed to file a record on appeal in
Spurbeck's case or take arty other action to perfect Spurbeck's appeal or
otherwise protect his rights to an a~peal. You took no action on Spurbeck's
behalf until you prepared a Motion for Appropriate Relief which you mailed to
him on or about August 5" 1986.
In the Rules of Professional Conduct, an attorney is advised of his
obligations in handling his client's legai matters. Rule 6(B)(3) states that
a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing
the client. Rule 7.1(A>,(1) states that a lawyer shall not intentionally fail
