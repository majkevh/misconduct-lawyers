FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF
6.
On January 13, 2012, William K. Graham ("Graham") of Versailles
Realty Partners, L.L.C. ("VRP"), engaged Defendant to complete a real estate transaction
for his purchase of Mary L. Henry's IllS interest in propeliy located at 511 Dupree
Street, Durham, North Carolina ("511 Dupree Street").
7.
VRP agreed to purchase the property interest fi'om Ms. Henry for $3,000,
and to pay a fee to Defendant of $800 for his legal services to complete the transaction.
8.
On or about January 17, 2012, Graham paid Defendant via a check in the
amount of$3,800, which Defendant acknowledged receiving as "eamest money" to be
held in "escrow" until the deed was retumed from Ms. Henry for the purchase of her
interest in the property.
9.
Instead of depositing and holding the eamest money and fee in his !I'ust
account, Defendant cashed the check from Graham and utilized the proceeds for his own
benefit.
10.
On February 8, 2012, Defendant forwarded to Ms. Henry a contract signed
by Graham, a quitclaim deed concerning "511 Dupree Street" to be signed by Ms. Henry,
and a settlement statement showing that Ms. Henry would receive $2,000 of the $3,000
paid by Graham, and that Defendant would receive $1,000 as his attorney's fee from Ms.
Henry.
II.
Defendant requested that Ms. Henry sign and return the enclosed
documents to Defendant's office.
On April 23, 2012, Defendant issued trust account check number 2823
12.
payable to himself in the amount of $3,000, which Defendant utilized that same date to
purchase a cashier's check in the amount of$3,000 payable to "Mary L. Henry."
13.
On check number 2823, Defendant attributed the withdrawal on the memo
line to "Mary L. Herny."
14.
At the time Defendant made the withdrawal of$3,000 fi'om his trust
account via check number 2823 on April 23, 2012, Defendant was not holding and had
not deposited any frmds in his trust account for William K. Graham, Graham's VRP, or
Ms. Henry.
15.

Ms. Henry declined to sign the quitclaim deed of her interest to Graham.

16.

Defendant never fOlwarded the cashier's check to Ms. Henry.

2

17.
On June 4, 2012, Graham filed a grievance against Defendant with the
State Bar claiming that Defendant had failed to complete the real estate transaction
between VRP and Ms. Henry, and that Defendant would not refund the money Graham
had provided to fund the transaction.
18.
A State Bar investigator contacted Defendant on June 6, 2012 and
informed him that the State Bar had received a complaint from Graham about the real
estate transaction involving Ms. Henry's interest in the propeliy located at 511 Dupree
Street.
19.
Following the State Bar investigator's contact with Defendant, Graham
approached Defendant on June 6, 2012 and demanded the return ofVRP's $3,800 in
entrusted funds.
20.
Using the uncashed cashier's check in the amount of $3,000 referenced in
Paragraph 12 above, on June 6, 2012 Defendant purchased another cashier's check from
Wells Fargo Bank on West Club Boulevard in Durham, North Carolina in the amount of
$3,800 payable to VRP.
21.
On June 6, 2012, Defendant paid to Graham the purpOlied refund of the
$3,800 using the cashier's check in the amount of$3,800 payable to VRP.
22.
Defendant never replaced the $3,000 he withdrew fi-om his tlUst account to
purchase the cashier's check payable to Ms. Herny
23.
At the time Defendant made the withdrawal of the $3,000 fi'om his bust
account referenced in Paragraph 12 above, Defendant was not holding and had not
deposited any funds in his bust account for Graham, VRP, or Ms. Henry.
24.
Defendant made inconsistent statements to the State Bar investigator
about whether he had placed the $3,800 in entrusted funds fi'om VRP in his tlUSt account
or had cashed the check from VRP.
25.
Defendant's bank records, including the bank records for his tlUst account
and operating account, showed that Defendant never deposited the $3,800 check from
VRP in either account.
26.
Defendant eventually admitted to the State Bar investigator that he had
cashed the $3,800 check from Graham's VRP.
27.
Defendant's tlUSt account records showed that Defendant used entlUsted
settlement funds belonging to Defendant's client Courtney Tauner to purchase the
cashier's check in the amount of $3,000 payable to Ms. Henry, which Defendant
eventually used to refund the $3,800 to Graham's VRP.
28.
Courtney Tallller did not authorize Defendant to utilize his $3,000 in
entlUsted settlement funds to purchase the cashier's checks which were eventually used to
refund the $3,800 to Graham's VRP.
29.
Defendant misappropriated $3,000 from VRP and then misappropriated
$3,000 from Tallller to cover the misappropriation from VRP.

FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF
30.
Hemy L. McGhee ("McGhee") retained Defendant on or about August 21,
2009 to represent him in connection with injuries he sustained in a motor vehicle accident
that occun'ed on August 17, 2009.
31.
On August 21, 2009, McGhee signed a contingent fee agreement under
which Defendant would receive 33\1,% of any settlement.
32.
Defendant and the insurance company settled McGhee's claim for $3,500,
which Defendant deposited in his trust account on February 2, 2010.
33.
Under Defendant's contingent fee agreement with McGhee, on Febl'uary
3,2010 Defendant disbursed to himself, via check number 2761 from his trust account,
his contingent fee of$I,166.65.
34.
McGhee was entitled to $2,333.35 of the settlement proceeds deposited in

35.
Defendant made a disbursement from his !lust account to McGhee of $550

36.
Defendant had received a check from Progressive Universal Insurance
Company, issued October 27, 2009, in the amount of$750 for McGhee's medical
expenses.
37.
Defendant's client ledger card for McGhee did not reflect the deposit of
the $750 into Defendant's trust account on behalf of McGhee.
38.
On February 12, 2010, McGhee signed a settlement statement
acknowledging receipt of check number 2762 from Defendant for $550.
39.
Although Defendant designated the $550 to McGhee as a disbursement
from the $3,500 February 2, 2010 settlement proceeds, the $550 to McGhee should have
been attributed to the $750 "Medpay" proceeds received fi-om Progressive Universal
Insurance Company on or about October 27, 2009.
40.
Defendant made a disbursement ii-om his trust account to McGee of $500
via check number 2810 on April 21, 2010.

the settlement funds to which McGhee was entitled.
44.
Defendant testified that the $138.35 was his earned money, but that he
paid McGhee the $138.35 in cash.
45.
Defendant testified that all the checks made payable to himself on
McGhee's client ledger card, except the check for Harper's fee of$1,166.65, were

not have any documentation of the cash given to McGhee.
47.
There was no documentation or notation of the $138.35 alleged cash

49.
In 20 I 0, McGhee did not retain Defendant to represent him on a driving
while impaired charge in Person County, North Carolina coulis.
50.
In 2010, Defendant did not represent McGhee on a driving while impaired
charge in Person County, North Carolina courts.
51.
Other than representing McGhee-in connection with the settlement of his
personal injury claim during 2009-2010, Defendant did not perfOlm additional legal
services for McGhee or bill McGhee for such services during 2009-2010.
52.
Defendant never provided McGhee a copy of the settlement statement
showing the disbursements related to the $3,500 settlement funds.
53.
On Friday, May 7,2010, McGhee and his girlfriend met with Defendant at
Defendant's office in Durham to receive a payment fi-om the settlement proceeds
referenced in Paragraph 32 above.
54.
On May 7, 2010, Defendant wrote a check payable to McGhee in tile
amount of$500, and gave McGhee the check.

55.
Defendant wrote the check to McGhee, referenced in Paragraph 54 above,
on his operating account, not fi-om his trust account into which he had deposited
McGhee's settlement funds.

$1,133.35 of entrusted settlement proceeds to which McGhee was entitled.
61.

Defendant misappropriated $1,133.35 of McGhee's entrusted settlement

funds.

A motor vehicle struck the residence of Nancy J. Mack ("Mack") in

79.
As of June 3, 2011, Defendant's client ledger card for Mack showed a
balance of $236, with no disbursements having been made to Mack of the entmsted
settlement proceeds deposited in Defendant's hust account.
80.
On July 28, 2011, Defendant made a deposit to his hust aCCOtUlt in the
amount of $4,000.
81.
Defendant's client ledger card for Mack showed the $4,000 deposit
referenced in Paragraph 80 above as having been credited to Mack.
82.
Defendant made the deposit referenced in Paragraph 80 above by check
number 1382, dated July 28, 2011, in the amount of $4,000, drawn on his operating
account.
83.
Defendant deposited the $4,000 into his tmst account to cover the shortage
of Mack's entmsted settlement funds in his hust account, which had fallen to a balance of
$236 on June 3, 2011 according to Defendant's client ledger card for Mack.
84.
On July 28,2011, Defendant disbursed to Mack a check (check number
2807) fi'om his tmst account in the amount of $6,250.
85.
According to Mack's client ledger card referenced in Paragraph 81 above,
the disbursement ofthe $6,250 to Mack on July 28,2011 created a negative balance of
$2,014 in Mack's account.
86.
Defendant's client ledger card for Mack, referenced in Paragraph 81
above, omitted check number 2796, dated Aplil15, 2011, made payable to Defendant in
the amount of$250.
87.
Because of Defendant's omission of check number 2796 in the amount of
$250 on Mack's client ledger card, as referenced in Paragraph 86 above, Defendant's
disbursement of the $6,250 to Mack on July 28,2011, as referenced in Paragraph 84
above, created a negative balance of $2,264, not $2,014, in Mack's account.
88.
Defendant used Mack's entmsted funds for his and/or someone's personal
benefit during the months of Febmary to sometime in late July or August 2011.
89.
Because Defendant had disbursed to himself a total of$6,264 ($914 +
$5,350) of Mack's enhusted funds for his and/or others personal benefit, and only
deposited $4,000 from his operating account to cover the shortage created by the
disbursements, Defendant used another client's entmsted funds (see Paragraph 104
below) to make up the $2,250 shortage in order to pay Mack the $6,250 to which Mack
was entitled.
90.
Defendant's disbursements to himself (outside of his $1,750 fee) during
Febmary to June 2011 totaling $6,264 ($914 + $5,350) were misappropriations fi'om
Mack's entmsted funds for his own and/or someone else's personal benefit, even though
Defendant evenrually paid Mack the full $6,250 to which she was entitled.
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF
8

91.
Shanicka Lewis ("Lewis") retained Defendant to represent her minor son
in connection with injuries he sustained in a motor vehicle accident that occurred on July
31,2008.
92.
Lewis signed a contingent fee agreement tmder which Defendant would
receive 33V,% ofany settlement amount and 10% of the initial $1,000 in Medicaid
reimbursement.
93.
On or about April 25, 2011, Defendant and Lewis, on behalf of her minor
son, agreed to a structured settlement with the insurance company, including a cash
settlement of $15,500 and gnaranteed future lump sum payments to the minor son.
94.
By consent order filed on July 11, 2011, Superior Court Judge Orlando
Hudson approved the structured settlement referenced in Paragraph 93 above, specifically
directing Defendant to make, among other disbursements from the settlement funds, an
immediate payment of$2,375.91 to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human
Services, Division of Medical Assistance, for medical expenses incUlTed by Lewis's
minor son.
95.
On July 11, 2011, Defendant deposited the $15,500 insurance settlement
check referenced in Paragraph 90 above in his trust account.
96.
Under Defendant's retainer agreement with Lewis and the terms of the
consent order, on July 14, 2011 Defendant disbursed to himself a check (check number
2806) from his trust account for $11,933.32, representing a contingent fee of33V,% of
the settlement ($11,833.32) plus 10% of the initial $1,000 in Medicaid reimbursement
($100).
97.
On July 15, 2011, Defendant disbursed to himself from his hust account
an additional $1,078.37 by check (check number 2805), which was to be provided to
Lewis for the necessary expenses of her minor son.
98.
Although the State Bar had alleged that Defendant did not disburse the
$1,078.37 to Lewis (Defendant claimed that he cashed the check and provided the cash to
Lewis), Lewis did not appear to testify as subpoenaed by the State Bar and therefore,
because of the absence of clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, the State Bar did not
pursue this allegation.
99.
Following the disbursements to Defendant referenced in Paragraphs 96
and 97 above, a total of $2,488.31 should have remained in Defendant's trust account to
cover the remaining Medicaid reimbursement ($2,375.91) and Defendant's expenses
($112.50).
100. As referenced in Paragraph 84 above, on July 28,2011 Defendant
disbursed to client Nancy Mack a check from his hust account in the amount of $6,250.
101.

Defendant's trust account balance fell to $251.07 on Augnst 18, 2011.

102.

Defendant's trust account balance was zero as of May 3, 2012.

9

103. On October 1, 2012, Defendant paid the Division of Medical Assistance a
check in the amount of $2,3 75.91 from his operating account, representing the Medicaid
reimbursement which he should have paid out of the entrusted settlement funds for
Lewis's minor son in July 2011, over one year earlier.
\04. An analysis of Defendant's hust account by the State Bar investigator
showed that the $2,375.91 in enhusted funds for Lewis's minor son were used by
Defendant to cover other over disbursements from his trust account, including the
shortage and negative balance created by the August IS, 2011 disbursement to Nancy
Mack of$6,250.
\05. At the hearing before this panel on May 22-23,2014, Defendant was
questioned about his failure to make the disbursement of$2,375.91 to the Division of
Medical Assistance as directed by Judge Hudson in the consent order of July II, 2011,
referenced in Paragraph 94 above, but Defendant provided no credible explanation for his
failure to make the required disbursement or what happened to the funds.
106.
minor son.

Defendant misappropriated the $2,375.91 in entrusted funds for Lewis's

107.
On September 19, 2014, only five days prior to the resumption of the
hearing before this panel on September 25,2014, Defendant moved for and obtained an
ex parte order signed by Judge Hudson purporting to "con'ect" the July 11, 20 II consent
order, and purporting to amend the consent order "to Nunc Pro Tunc the actual
compliance date to the original compliance date and the court finds that all orders have
been complied with per the orders previously entered by this court."
lOS. The September 19, 2014 ex parte order signed by Judge Hudson,
referenced in Paragraph 107 above, does not absolve Defendant of the misappropriation
of entrusted funds for Lewis's minor son.

Based upon the evidence, the hearing panel also finds by clear, cogent, and
convincing evidence the following

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT CONCERNING DISCIPLINE
I.

Defendant has substantial experience in the practice oflaw.

2.

Defendant's misconduct occurred in connection with his representation of

clients.
3.
On September 19, 2014, only five days prior to the resumption of the
healing before this panel, Defendant moved for and obtained an ex parte temporary
restraining order ("TRO") fi'om Judge Hudson in Christopher G. Hmper v. Edward
White, Nancy Mack, Henry McGhee, Courtney Tanner, Shanicka Lewis, & Helen Gray,
No. 14-CVS-4829 (Durham Co. Super. Ct.), alleging that he had commenced a civil suit
(Defendant did not file a complaint, but obtained summonses with leave to file a
complaint) against the named defendants who were potential witnesses against him in this
disciplinary proceeding.

17

4.
The TRO purpOlied to prevent the named defendants (all ofthe named
defendants, except State Bar Investigator Ed White, were Defendant's former clients)
fi-om testifying against Defendant in the disciplinary proceeding scheduled to resume on
Thursday, September 25,2014.
5.

Defendant obtained the TRO without notice to the named Defendants.

6.
As a result of the issuance of the ex parte TRO, the State Bar's Office of
Counsel was required to take extraordinary measures on an exigent basis to stay the TRO
so that this proceeding could resume as scheduled, including emergency petitions to the
NOlih Carolina Court of Appeals.
7.
On Wednesday, September 24,2014, the NOlih Carolina Court of Appeals
allowed the State Bar's motion for temporary stay and stayed Judge Hudson's TRO,
allowing the disciplinary hearing to proceed as scheduled. Harper v. White, et ai., No.
P14-744 (N.C. Ct. of App., Order ofSep!. 24, 2014).
8.
The State Bar has an important public interest in the completion of its
disciplinary hearings, and Defendant sought to subvert that interest by obtaining the ex
parte TRO from Judge Hudson.
9.
Defendant's actions in attempting to subvert the State Bar's impOliant
public interest in its disciplinary hearings and his collateral unfounded civil action against
potential witnesses against him show that he refuses to acknowledge the wrongful natUre
of his conduct and that he elevates his own interest above that of his fonner clients.
10.
Defendant enjoys a reputation in the Durham community of being a
compassionate attorney.
Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel also enters the following
DISCIPLINE CONCLUSIONS
1.
The healing panel has carefully considered all of the different fonns of
discipline available to it. In addition, the hearing panel has considered all ofthe factors
enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin. Code 1B § .0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of
the North Carolina State Bar and finds the following factors are applicable in this matter:
a. No prior disciplinary offt~nse;
c. A dishonest or selfish motive;
f.

Defendant engaged in a pattern of misconduct;

g. There were multiple offenses;
o. Defendant refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct, but,
after the hearing panel announced its findings in the Phase One hearing,
18

Defendant did acknowledge to the hearing panel the wrongful nature of
his conduct;
p. Defendant expressed remorse for his conduct after the hearing panel's
findings were announced;
q. Defendant's good character or reputation for honesty in the community;
1".

The vulnerability of the victims; and,

s. Defendant's substantial experience in the practice oflaw.
2.
The heating panel has carefully considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C. Admin. Code 1B § .OI14(w)(1) of the Rules and Regulations ofthe NOlth
Carolina State Bar and finds the following factors walTant consideration of suspension or
disbarment of Defendant's license:
a. Intent of Defendant to cause the resulting harm or potential hatm;
b. Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the hatm or potential harm is
foreseeable;
c. Circumstances reflecting Defendant's lack of honesty, tmstworthiness, or
integrity;
d. Elevation of Defendant's own interest above that of the client;
e. Negative impact of Defendant's actions on the clients' or public's
perception of the legal profession;
f.

Negative impact of Defendant's actions on the administration of justice;

g. Impairment of the clients' ability to achieve the goals ofthe
representation; and
1.

Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication.

3.
The hearing panel has also carefully considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C, Admin, Code 1B § ,OI14(w)(2) ofthe Rules and Regulations of
the North Carolina State Bar and finds the following factors walTant consideration of
suspension or disbarment of Defendant's license:
a. Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication;
c. Misappropriation or conversion of assets of any kind to which Defendant
or recipient is not entitled, whether from a client or any other source; and,
d. Commission of felonies.

19

4.
Defendant's failure to properly maintain and handle entrusted funds
betrays a vital trust that clients and the public place in attorneys and the legal profession.
5.
Defendant's misconduct caused potential significant harm to his clients in
that his failure to safeguard entrusted client funds placed his clients' funds at risk.
6.
Defendant's misconduct caused significant harm to multiple of his clients
in that he failed to make prompt disbursements of entrusted settlement funds to or on
behalf of some clients (though he ultimately paid these clients the sums to which they
were entitled).
7.
Defendant's misconduct caused significant harm to one client, Henry
McGhee, in that Defendant misappropriated for his own benefit $1,333.35 of McGhee's
entrusted funds, never paying McGhee al1 of the settlement funds to which McGhee was
entitled.
8.
Defendant's misappropriations from his clients show that he is
untrustwmihy and his misapproPliations also constitute criminal offenses, demonstrating
his unfitness to be an attorney, especially an attorney who handles entrusted funds.
9.
Given the prior random audit of Defendant's trust account which
addressed many of the same issues, Defendant is unable or unwilling to conform his
conduct to the Rules of Professional Conduct.
10.
Defendant's actions in seeking and obtaining the ex parte orders from
Judge Hudson show iliat he refuses to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct
and suggest the loss of Defendant's ability to practice law may be the only means of
protecting the public from Defendant.
11.
The hearing panel has considered al1 other fmIDs of discipline available
and concludes that any sanction less than disbarment would fail to acknowledge the
seriousness of the offenses committed by Defendant, would not adequately protect the
public, and would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the
conduct expected of members of the Bar.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Findings
Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel enters the following
