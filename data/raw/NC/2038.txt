:,11

This matter was scheduled before the undersigned Guilford C~~ntySuperior
COl.lrt Judge on June 22, 1998 aft~r a May 11, 1998 .order to Show Cause was issued by
Judge Micha,~l E~ Beale directing Keith Henderson Harrell (hereinafter Harrell) to show
cause why he sh'ould' not be held in contempt for his willful ot grossly negligent failure to
perform his duties as counsel for a client and as an officer of the court. Judge Beale appointed A. Root Edmonson, Deputy Counsel of the North Carolina State Bar, to
prosecute the contempt case. Harrell was served with the Order to Show Cause a,nd was
present in court on June 22, 1998 without counsel.
Prior to the contempt case being heard, the parties recommended to the
undersigned that the appropriate resolution of this matter, and the resolution that is in the
best interest of the public, is for Harrell to be placed on disability inactive status. In open
court, Hartell consented to the court considering his transfer to disability inactive status
without further notice to him.
Based upon the, case notes of Dr. Jeff Marshal, MD, which the undersigned has
reviewed, the evidence off~red at the hearing, and the consent of the parties, the
undersigned makes the following:
