./

As you knqw I have previously repre'sented Mr. and Mrs.
Green and have filed a. Proof of Claim in their case fo~ f~es·
due us in the amount of $2,125.59.
As you know I client con·fidence$ do not appiy as. between
an attor.ney and a client when the collection of a fee is
involved.

I

In reviewing the petition of the Greens i fail ton'ote
any mention of a Promissory Note from Barbara Holt in the.
approximate amount of $22,000.00 payabl~ at the r.ate of
$522.50 per month, nor is there any reference to the t·ransfer
6f a storage· building, warehouse, and cucumber st;'atiot,l to
Patty Green sometime in 1984, a1ong.with the tranf?fe1= of ill
lake lot on Lake Gaston to Patty Green. Patty Green is the:
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Green.

•

I have not publicly raised any of these questions at
this point. If we can reach some satisfactory agreement with.
respect to the handling o·f the balance due to us., then this
I!latter may, in fact, be put to rest.

days.
