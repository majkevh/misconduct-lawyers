On October 27, 1993, the Grievance Committee of the North

Probable cause is defined in the rules as Ifrea$onable Gaus~ to

of misconduct justifying disciplinary action: If
'

The 'rules provide' that. after a finding of probable Gause, the
Grievance Committee may determine that the filing of a complaint
and' a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing Commission arendt
reqaired and the Grievance· Committee may issue vc;lrious levels of
dis'oipiine depending upon the misconduct, the actual qr potential
,injury ca1,lsed, and any aggravating or mitigating, factors. ,Th,e
Grievaflce Committee mctY,issue an admon;i.tion,' reprimand, or
censure to the ~espondent attorney . .
A reprimand is a writt·en. form of di$cipline mor:e serioUS tharJ. an.
admonition issued in cases in ~hich an, attorney hasviolateq 'one
or more provisions of tlJ.e Rules of Professional Conduct and has
caused harm or potential harm t·o a client, the administration of,
justice, the profession, o'r a member of the public, pu,t the
misconduct does,not require a censure.
The Grievance Committee WaS of the opinion that a censure is'not
r'equired in this case' and issues this re'primand to' you: . As'
chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State
Bar, it is now my du,ty to issue this reprimand and, I am certai:rl
that you will understand fully the spirit in whichthi~ duty is
performed.
, .
The Grieyanoe Committee found that Complainant's wife, Sin
Robertson, was injured in an automobile acoident and hired yoU to
pursue a personal" injury claim; that Mrs. Robertso:rl ag~e¢d to pay
you one-third of any amount recovered; that the week before this
''', case was scheduled for trial, the defendant made a:rl offer of '
sett'lementof $18; 000; t,hat shortly thereaft,er, you notified the
Robertsons tb,at the insurance 'company had made an offer ?l,nd
advised tb,em to take it.; that the Robertsons did not want to
accept tb,e settlement since it did not evehcover Mrs.
'
Robertson's medical expenses:, that the Robertsons told VQu, that

. ,they would rather go to court; that you then told the Robertsons
that if they insisted on going to trial, they would have to pay
you one-third of the settlement offer ($6,000) plus expenses
incurred before he would represent them at trial; that
complainant argued that ·the employment contract clearly stated
that if no set,tlement Wc;iE;l reach~d then there wc:>uld be no fee;
that youcontipued to insist th~t. they either ~gree. to the
settlement or pay ·you $6,000 plus expenses; that the Robertsons
could not a'fford to pay you the $6,000 plus exp~nses and were
unable to hire another lawyer in' such·a short period of time; and
that they were therefore forced to accept the settlement.

I

The committee determined that by threatening to withdraw from
·represent"i:q.g M:;r-s. Robertson on the eve of :Q.er trial unless she
either accepted the sett.lement offer or paid you $6,00.0 plus
expenses, you "dolated Rule 7.1 (A) (2) which states: . !'A lawyer
shall not intentionally .:. . E.f] ail to carry 'out a· contract of
employment ent~red into with a client for profess.ional services .
. " The com~ittee' also determined that this conduct violated
Rule 7.1(C1 (1) which sti?-tes: "A lawyer shall..
[a]bide by a
client's decision whether to accept an offer of settlement of a
matter.
"
You are hereby reprimanded by the North Carolina State Bar due to
. your proi'es.sional tnisconduc;:t. The Grievance Committee trusts
that you will J11eed this. reprimand., that it will be remembered by
you, that it will be beneficial to you, and that you will never
again allow yourself to depart from adherence to the high ethical
st~ndards of the legal profession.
In accordance with the policy adopted October 15,
Council of the 'North Ca:tolinaState Bar regarding
the adminis·trative and investigative costs to any
a reprimand by the Grievance Committee, the costs
in the amount 6f $50.00 are hereby taxed to you.
