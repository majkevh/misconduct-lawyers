trust agreement between herself and Roush that by its terlllS gave Maness the power to
vote Roush's stock.

The ability to vote Roush's stock would have given Maness the ability to deffiaJ)d
cumulative voting.

John Vernon (Vernon), who had prepared Roush's will, was at the March shareholders'
meeting representing Maness. pefendant was at the March shareholders' meeting
representing Copland, Inc.

to transfer her voting rights in the Copland stock to the Coplands. They asked defendant

defendant or other members of defendant's firm.
