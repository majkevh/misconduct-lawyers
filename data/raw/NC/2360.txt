.
b. Johnson-presented substantial evidence of good character and
reputation in his home cortnnunity in the trial·ofN.C. State Bar v.
Johnson, 03 DHC 1.
.
c. The misconduct recited herein occurred at the same time as the
violations ofthe Rules of Professional Conduct which are the subject
of the order of discipline entered in N,C. State Bar v. Johnson, 03
DHC 1. .

j. The aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors.

4.

Johnson's misconduct has caused actual hartn to a number of his clients
and their families and has'hanned the standing of the legal profession in the eyes
of some members of the public.
.

I

5',. Johnson's failure to respond in a timely fashion to the State Bar'~ le1;ter
of notice. regarding the grievances filed by Ms. Davis'-Thomas and Kalomo Ellis
lindermihes the State Bar's ability to regulate attorneys and undermines the
privilege' of attorneys in. this state to remain self-regulatin'g.
6. An order actively suspending Johnson's law license is not required in
this case, as Johnson's law license was suspended in :N.C. State Bar v. Johnson,
03 DHC 11, and the order in that case contains SUfficient provisions designed to
safeguarq the public and the standing of the bar.
