Page 6of14

c. By collecting $2,000 from Terzakis to handle his claims and then failing
to perform any meaningful work on Terzakis's behalf and failing to refund

Additional Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline
1. Defendant was admonished by the Grievance Committee in 2016 for failing to
respond to the 26th Judicial District Bar Grievance Committee, for failing to
respond timely to the State Bar Grievance Committee, and for failing to
respond to requests for additional information from the State Bar Grievance
Committee.
2. The purpose of the State Bar's fee dispute resolution program is to give clients
a readily accessible and free process by which to attempt to resolve issues
relating to disputed fees. Defendant's failure to respond to and participate in
good faith in the fee dispute resolution program denied his clients this benefit
and interfered with the State Bar's self-regulatory function.
3. Defendant's dishonest and selfish actions caused actual or potential significant
harm to the public's trust and confidence in the legal profession.
Based on the Established Facts, the Conclusions of Law and the Additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure,
suspension, and disbarment, in considering the appropriate discipline to
impose in this case.

NCSB v. Ellingworth, 18 DHC 4
Order Imposing Discipline
Page 8 of14

2. The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. IB Â§ .0116(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Rules and Regulations of the
North Carolina State Bar and concludes the following factors are applicable:
27 N.C.A.C. IB Â§. 0116(a)(1):
a. Factor (B), intent of Defendant to commit acts where the hann or potential
hann is foreseeable;
b. Factor (C), circumstances reflecting the Defendant's lack of honesty,
trustworthiness, or integrity;
c. Factor (D), elevation of the defendant's own interest above that of the
client;
d. Factor (E), negative impact of the Defendant's actions on the client's or
public's perception of the profession;
e. Factor (G), impainnent of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the
representation;
g. Factor (I), acts of dishonesty and misrepresentation; and
h. Factor (J), multiple instances of failure to participate
profession's self-regulation process.

III

the legal

27 N.C.A.C.1B Â§ .0116(a)(2):
a. Factor (A), acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, or deceit.
27 N.C.A.C. IB Â§ .116(a)(3):
a. Factor (A), prior disciplinary offenses;
b. Factor (C), dishonest or selfish motive;
c. Factor (D), lack of timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to
rectify consequences of misconduct;
d. Factor (E), indifference to making restitution;
e. Factor (F), a pattern of misconduct; and
f.

Factor (0), multiple offenses.

2. The Hearing Panel has considered all of the disciplinary options available to it
and determined that a period of active suspension is appropriate and
necessary.
3. Defendant's conduct resulted in significant harm to his clients.
NCSB v. Ellingworth, 18 DHC 4
Order Imposing Discipline

Page 90f14

4. By failing to disclose his upcoming suspension to his client, Defendant failed
to act in his client's best interests and acted with a dishonest and selfish
motive.
5. The legal profession is entrusted with the privilege of self-regulation. The
State Bar can only regulate the profession if its members respond timely and
fully to inquiries of the State Bar.

6. The Hearing Panel has considered lesser sanctions and concludes that any
discipline short of suspension would not adequately protect the public for the
following reasons:
a. Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses, would not adequately protect
the clients, the public, and the administration of justice, and would send
the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct
expected of members of the Bar of this State;
b. Defendant has failed to reform his conduct in response to lesser prior
discipline; and
c. For the public to have confidence in the State Bar's regulation of the
profession, lawyers who continuously engage in improper conduct must be
removed from the profession.
Based upon the foregoing Established Facts, Conclusions of Law,
Additional Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline and Conclusions of Law
Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel hereby enters the following:
