FUBLIC REPRIMAND

on April 13, 1989, the Grievance Committee of the North Cc}rOlina state

Bar mei;: and considered the grievance filed against you by Iarry & Barbara

Butler.

Pursuant to Seci;:ion 13 (7) of Article IX of the Rules and Regulations. of
the North carolina state Bar, the Grievance COmmittee, after considering the
evidence, including your response to the letter of Notice, found probable
cause which is defined in tlie·-rules as "reasonable cause to believe that a
member of the North carolina State Bar is gUilty of misconduct justifying
disCiplinary action."
'!he .rules. provide that after. a finding of probable cause, the Grievance
committee may detennine that the filing of a complaint and a hearing before

. the DiSCiplinary Hear~ Commission are not ~ am the Grievance .
committee may issue var~ous levelS of discipline depending upon the
misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any aggravating or
miti~ting factors.
'!h~ Grievance Committee may issue a Private Reprimand, a
Publ~c Reprimand, or a Public CensUre to th~ ,accused attomey.

'!be Grievance COmmittee was of the .opWon that a. compla;int and: hearing
a,re not ~ in this case and issues thiS; PllPlic Reprimand to y~. As
chaiJ::'man of the GrievanCe Conunittee of the North carolina state Ba:i::', it is now
my duty to iSSqe this Public Reprimand and I am certain that you will
understand fully the spirit in which this duty is performed.
A Public Repr:iinand is. a serious fom of discipline imposed by the
Grievance ConJrnittee. 'rhe Grievance committee felt that your conduct warranted
public discipline due to your violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.
'!he committee trusts that this misconduct will not reoccur.
You represented Barbara P. Butler in a claim resulting from an automobile
accident she was': involved ih:'on September 26, 1986. Prior to Januaxy 12,
1987, the case was settled with a representative of Nationwide Insurance
COltpany. A draft was iSsued payable to you, your client, and her husband
larry Butler. Ypu were advised and understc:xXl that Ms. autler had authority
to sign,her husbandl~ ~ fOJ;~1-:~ deposits and,checks. You supervised
your cl~ent's execut~on, of)~et~ease that ac::cam,paru.ed the draft. You
allowed Ms. Butler to s~gn~th her and her husband's names to the release.
You then signed the release in yO'llr cawpity as a notary public acknowledging
----- .~.
that they had both ap~~ before you &xl signed the release when in fact
··-----:-.,.,~_'\;..,;-...J.Qc.~-as· n0t preSent and bad not signed it.

Your statement on the r~lease that larry ButleJ; ~nallyappea,red
before you and. signed the rel,ease was not true. ,It v~ol,ated Ri.l.le 1.2 (0) of
the Rules of Professional Conduct.
In deciding to issue thj.s Public Reprimarxl, the committee ~,awa:J;ethpt
you did not intend to Qeceive the insurance company or I.arry 13utl~., '!he
committee was also aware that neither of the autl~ were tIpSe-C abOut y~
handling of this matter and that these' grievances were inSpfredby a '
disgruntled fonner secretary of yours. '!he committee ~ -you were onLy
attempting to get the matter ~ttled ~ quickly as possible' at 'yoUr client's'
insistence. However, the conunittee still felt your co~¢t was :wrong and
Warranted th.if; action.
