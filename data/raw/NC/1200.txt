AFFIDAVIT OF SURRENDER
Victoria L. Sprouse, being first duly sworn, deposes and says as follows:

1. I desire to resign and hereby tender my license to practice law in North
Carolina pursuant to State Bar Discipline & Disability Rule 27 NCAC 1B §.0117.
2. My resignation is freely and voluntarily rendered, and is not the result of
coercion or duress. I am fully aware of the implications of submitting my resignation.
3. I am aware that there is a pending investigation by the State Bar regarding my
conviction on April 1, 2009 in Federal Court for the Western District of North Carolina of
18 counts of felony mail, wire and/or bank fraud, conspiracy and money laundering.
4. I acknowledge that the material fact upon which the investigation is predicated,
that on April 1, 2009 I was convicted in Federal Court for the Western District of North
Carolina of 18 counts of felony mail, wire and/or bank fraud, conspiracy and money
laundering is true.
5. I am submitting my resignation because I know that if disciplinary charges
were predicated upon the misconduct under investigation relating to my conviction of
the above referenced charges, I could not successfully defend against them.
