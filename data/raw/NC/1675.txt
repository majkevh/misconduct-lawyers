On October 30·" 1989, the State Bar issued a
subpoena duces tecum to th~ Defendant. The
subpoena duces tecum was se~t by certified mail,
restricted delivery and the return receipt was

the Def~hdant and her company on occasion~ ~rior ~o
the notl.ce~ sent by the state Bar by certl.fl.ed mal.l
to the Defendant.

The Defehdant failed to rebut the presumption that
Bill Gill was an agent of the Defendant authorized
by a~pointment or b:y law to be served or to accept
servl.ce of the certl.fied mail which contained the
notices from the state Bar' regarding Ms". Chambers'
grievance. Thus, the Defendant was served with

Based upon the following Findings of Fact, the hearing
committee makes the' following:

I

,CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.

By failing to refund the unearned portion of '
attorney's fees paid by Ms. Chambers, the Defendant
has violated Rule 2.8(A) (3).

2.

By failing to provide a full and fair response to
the Letter of Notice no later than 1S days after
receiving it and pyfailing to respond.to the state
Bar's follow-up letter reg~rding the grievance, the
Defendant failed to answer a formal inquiry of' the
North Carolina state Bar in a disciplinary matter
in violation of N.C. Gen. stat. section· 84-23 (b) (3)
and Rule 1,.1~B) and engaged in conduct prejudicial
to the adminl.stration of justice in violatl.on of

PUBLIC CENSURE

I

This ~ublic Ce~su~e is delivered to Y9u pursuant to section
23 of Art1cle IX o~ the Rules and Regulat10ns of the North
Carolina state Bar as ordered by a hearing committee of the
Disciplinary Hearing Commission following a hearing in the
abbve-ca~tioned ~roceeding on August 6( 1990.
At,that hea~i~g,
,the hear1ng comm1ttee f.ound that you v10lated var10US prov1s1ons
of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the North Carolina state
Bar.
'
In February of 1988, Karen Chambers retained you to defend a
lawsuit filed by her husband wherein he sought custody of their
children. Ms. Chambers paid you your requested attorney's fee of
$1,000 on February 19, 1988. You filed an answer and
counterclaim on behalf of Ms. Chambers on July 1988, five months
after the original complaint was filed.
You had very limited time involved in rour representation of
Ms. Chambers, apart from filing an answer 1n the case. Although
Mr. Chambers ahandoned his pursuit of custody of ,the children,
you made no constr~ctive effort to pursue Ms. Chambers'
counterclaim. While you were still counsel of record for Ms.
Chambers, you allowed the dismissal of her counterclaim without
any notice to her. The hearing committee noted your testimony
that you withdrew from representation of Ms. Chambers on or about
September 1988. However, you never sought leave of court to
withdraw from the representation, nor advise Ms. Chambers of the
need ,to secure other counsel.

I

The hearing cOI'l)mittee determined that the reasonable value of
your services to Ms. Chambers did not exceed $200. M~. Chambers
demanded the return of her fee.
YoU offered at one t1me to
return $2.00 of the fee, but no part of the fee had been refunded
to MS., Chambers as of the date of the hearing in this matter.
Your failure to refund the unearned portion of the fee paid
to you violates Rule 2.8(A)(3} of the North Carolina Rules of
Professional Conduqt. Rule 2.8(A) (3) provides that "(a) lawyer
who withdraws frornemployment shall refund promptly any part of a
fee ~aid ~n adVance that has not been earned." Whet: an advanced
fee 1S pa1d to an attorney, the attorney has an eth1cal

On October 30, 1989, the State Bar issued you a subpoena
duces tecum which required you to appear before the North

The hearing committee determined that Bill Gill'was your

the State Bar regarding Ms. Chambers' grievance. Although you: '
contend ~hat you,never receiyed the notices from.thest~te Bart,
the hear1ng comm1ttee determ1ned that you were servec3,w1th .nqt1ce
of the grievance.

I

Your failure to' respond to the North catolina state BaX-'$
formal inquiries violates N.C. Gen. Stat. Sec. ~4-28:(b)(3), :Rule
1. 1 (B) and Rule 1.2 (D) of the North Carolina Rules of

Professional Conduct. Your failure to respond ~o the stateB~x­
is inexqusable., As a licensed attorney in North Carolina, yoU .
have an obligation to respond to the North Carolina State Bar'~

Carolina state Bar can carry out its funct10n of disci'pline' and
regulation of its members when attorneys cooperate by giving
,full, fair and prompt re$ponses to the State Barfs inquiries.
The. Committee was concerned that you failed to ac;:know:),.edge Y9ur
errant conduct in no't responding to the State Bal;'. You are
advised that the State Bar cannot a;tlow attorney.s to :ynQ.ermi..n~
its disciplinary process by failing to cooperate with the·., .'.
investigation of grievances filed against them. You are aQ.vised
that should you ever receive another inquiry from thet North
Carolina State Bar, you should respond to it wi.th dispatch •.
