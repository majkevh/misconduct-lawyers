Mr. Shean became dissatisfied with the results and demanded a refund of hi~ fee., You did not
refund any of the additional $300 fee paid and Mr. Shean filed a petition for fee dispute
resolution with the Bar.
On 2 April 2003, you received by certified mail a notice of mandatory fee dispute
resolution from the Client Assistance Program of the North Carolina State Bar dated 31 March
~003. You did not respond within theIS-day period as required by rule. On 12 May 2003, you,
received by certified mail a second notice ofmandatoty fee dispute resolution from the Client
Assist~ce Pr<;>grarp dated 7 May 2003. Again, you did not tespond: On 5 June 2003, you
received a third and final notice of mandatory fee dispute resolution dated 29 May 2003. You ,did
not respond to that notice as requited eitheJ,".

I

On 21 July 2003, you received by certified mail a Letter of Notice from the Chair of the
Grievance Committee concerning the complaint by Mr. Shean that you had not provid¢d servjces
and had not refunded his fee as well as your failure to respond to the fee dispute resolution
notices. By Bar rule. you had 15 days to respond. You failed to respond to the Letter of Nodee by
the deadline required. A reminder letter was sent to you on 15 September 2003. You did not
resp<;>nd to it. Finally, a subpoena was issued compelling your appearance before couns~l on 30
October 2003. You did aPl'ear in response and did answer questions. Howevez:, you provided no
good answer or excuse for your failure to respond to the earlier notices.
The Comm.ittee found that your above-described conduct violated several Rules and
Revised Rules ofPJ.'ofessional Conduct. Rule 1.5(f) requires you to participate in good faith in
the mandatory fee dispute process. Rule 8.1 (b) requires you. to respond to the lawful demand for
information from the disciplinary authority. Finally, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28(b)(3}makes a
failure to respond to any formal inquiry and contempt of any committee of the BaJ,"grounds for
discipline. Even assuming there were no grounds for discipline with regard to your actions on
behalf of Mr. Shean, your failure to respond to the Bar's notices constituted the grounds for
imposition of the discipline issued in this matter.

In deciding to issue a Reprimand, the Committee considered the following aggravating
and mitigating factors. In aggravation, the Committee considered the multiple instances of your
failure to respond in the same matter. In mitigation, the Committee considered that this was your
first ,offense. The COmniittee,strongly believes that the integrity of the self-regulation of the
profession and the potential for harm to the reputation ofthe profession require attorneys to
, promptly respond to the Bar's inquiries as required by rule and st~tute.
