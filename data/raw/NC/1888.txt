CENSURE

On January 11, 1996, the Grievance Committee ofthe North Carolina State Bar met andco~sidered
the grievance filed against you by Dr. S. Y.
Pursuant to section .01 13 (a) of the Discipline and pisability Rules of the North Carolina State Bar;
the Grievance Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the
.
information available to it, including your response to the letter of n()tice, the Griev~ce Conunittee '
found probable cause. Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable cause to
believe that a member ofthe North Carolina State Bar is gldlty ofmiscon4uctjustifying disciplinary
action,"
.
"
The rules provide that after a finding of probable cause, the Grievance Committee may determine
that the filing of a complaint and a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission are not required and the Grievance Committee may issue various levels of discipline
'depending upon the misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any aggravating or
mitigating factors; The Grievance Committee may issl,le an admonition, reprimand, or a ~ellsure.

A censure is a written form of discipline more serious than a reprimancl,. issued in cases in which ~.
attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct and has caused .
significant harm or potential significant hann to a client, the administration of j\lstice, the profession "or
a member of the public, but the misconduct does not require suspension of
the attorney's license.
The Grievance Committee believes that a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing Commission is
not required in this case and issues this censure to you. As chairm~ of the Grievance Committee of
the North Carolina State Bar, it is now my duty to issue this censure. I am certain that you will'~'
,
understand fully .the spirit in which this duty is performed.
'
In November 1992, you undertook to represent Dr. S.Y. respecting Or. S.Y.'s efforts to obtain an '
accelerated immigrant visa, work authorization and temporary family visa. Dr. S. Y. agreed to pay you
$2,500 for these services and actually paid $1,000 toward the total fee. It does not appear, however, '
that you performed arty significant work for Dr. S.Y. beyond obtaining two extensions of his B-2 visa:
Consequently, the Grievance Conimittee concluded that you neglected Dr. S. y. 's legal matter, in

violation of Ru1e 6(b)(3) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Your failure to pursue Dr. S.Y.'s legal
matter promptly is aggravated by the fact that you have twice been disciplined by the N.C. State Bar
'for neglecting other clients' matters. Finally, the Grievance Committee concluded that you failed to _
communicate adequately with Dr. S.Y. concerning his matter, and that your conduct in this regard violated Rule 6(b)(I) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. '
,

You are hereby censured by the North Carolina State Bar for your violation of the Rules of
Professional Conduct, The Grievance Committee trusts that.you will ponder this censure,
recognize the error that you have made, -and that you will never again allow yourself to depart fromadherence to the high ethical standards of the legal profession. This censure should serve as
a strong remin~er and inducement for you to weigh carefully in the future yoUr responsibility to the, 1 public, your cli¢nts, your fellow attorneys and the courts, to the end that you demean

'
yourself as a respected member of the legal profession whose conduct may be relied upon without

question.
In accordance with the policy adopted October 15, 1981 by the Council of the North Catolina State
Bar regarding the taxing of the administrative and investigative costs to any attomey issued
a censure by the Grievance Committee, the costs of this action in the amount of$50.00 are hereby
taxed to you.
