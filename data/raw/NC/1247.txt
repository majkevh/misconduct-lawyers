On 16 September 2015 Tucker's balance in his trust account was insufficient to
20.
support payment of a check for $463.00 for client J. Neri presented for payment on that date.
21.
Tucker made deposits inte his trust account by cash and credit card without
identification of the client for whom he was depositing the funds.
22.
Tucker did not conduct the required monthly and quarterly reconciliations of his
trust account.
23.
By letter dated 30 March 2016, the State Bar asked Tucker to provide the State
Bar with certain information and documents, including:
a. His client ledgers for all clients for whom funds were deposited or disbursed or
who otherwise had funds in his trust account for the period of I January 2013 to
31 December 2015 2;
b. Identification of the clients whose funds were disbursed by the unattributed
attorney fee checks from 2013 to 2015, along with supporting documentation,
including the client ledger, fee agreement, and any settlement or disbursement
statement or accounting;
c. Identification of the clients for whom cash and credit card deposits were made,
along with supporting documentation including the client ledger, fee agreement,
and any settlement statement or disbursement statement or accounting;
d. Any and all documentation ofa purported 7 September 2015 deposit of$463.00
for client J. Neri identified on that previously provided client ledger, including
deposit ticket, deposited item, andlor the credit card receipt/documentation, if

made by credit card; and
e. Infonnation and docwnents establishing the fees and costs to which Tucker was
entitled for clients V. Martinez, S. Maya, O. Morales, E. Shaw, J. Sprinkle, and
O. Vasquez, including the fee agreement, any disbursement summary or
accounting, any cost receipts, and any other documentation justifying the
amounts he collected from those client's funds.
24.
Tucker failed to respond to the State Bar's 30 March 2016 letter, despite having
requested and received an extension of time to respond.
25.
By letter dated 22 June 2016, the State Bar notified Tucker of the allegation that
he had misappropriated entrusted funds through the unidentified attorney fee checks as well as
from clients V. Martinez, O. Morales, E. Shaw, and O. Vasquez. The letter noted Tucker had
been given the opportunity to show these were appropriate client disbursements by providing the
infonnation and documents requested in the State Bar's 30 March 2016 letter but that he had
failed to do so. Tucker was invited to provide anything additional he wished to have considered.
26.
Tucker sent the State Bar some materials, received by the State Bar on I July
2016. Tucker provided no additional client ledgers and no supporting documentation. He
provided the following new items;
a. A list with names purporting to correspond with attorney fee checks from 2015
only, with no supporting documentation and with no infonnation for the 2013
and 2014 checks;
b. A list with names purporting to correspond with many of the cash deposits, with
no supporting documentation; and
c. A list of names and nwnbers purporting to identify credit card deposits into his
trust account, with no supporting documentation.

27.
In addition to lacking any supporting documentation, the information Tucker
provided was inconsistent with the trust account bank records and other information Tucker
provided, as illustrated by the following examples;
a. The dates and amounts of credit card deposits listed by Tucker did not correspond
to the dates and amounts of credit card deposits in the bank records;
b. Tucker attributed check 12542 in part to attorney fees for client A. Tristan, but he
had already disbursed her attorney fee to himself in check 12539;
c. Tucker attributed check 12543 in the amount of $245.55 as attorney fees for client
C. Roseborough, !?ut the most Tucker identified as deposited for C. Roseborough
was $100.00 and that purported deposit did not correspond to any deposit shown
in the bank records;

The North Carolina State Bar v. Lennard D. Tucker, 16 DHC 34
Order of Discipline

Page 80ft5

d. Tucker attributed a deposit by credit card as tor client C. Smith but the date and
amount he identified do not match any deposit on the bank statement, and no such
deposit was included by Tucker on the client ledger Tucker had provided for C.
Smith in the previously provided client ledgers.
In June and July 2016, the State Bar notified Tucker on multiple occasions of the
28.
allegation that that he had misappropriated entrusted funds through the unidentified attorney fee
checks as well as from clients V. Martinez, O. Morales, E. Shaw, and O. Vasquez, and
repeatedly requested documentation establishing his entitlement to those funds. Tucker failed to
provide any such documentation.
Based upon the pleadings, Defendant's default, and the foregoing Findings of Fact, the
Hearing Panel enters the following:

Findmgs of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order of Discipline, 05 DHC 17.)

4.
Defendant caused significant harm to his clients by misappropriating their
entrusted funds.

5.
Proper maintenance and management of entrusted funds is a cornerstone of the
public's trust in the legal profession. Embezzlement is one of the most serious offenses an
attorney can commit, betraying the client's trust in the attorney and the public's trust in the legal
profession. Defendant's misappropriation caused harm to the standing of the legal profession,
undermining trust and confidence in lawyers and the legal system.

6.
Defendant's repeated commission of criminal acts reflecting adversely on his
honesty, trustwortbiness or fitness as a lawyer caused potential significant harm to the legal
profession, in that criminal conduct tends to bring the legal profession into disrepute.
7.
Defendant's failure to respond to the letter of notice from the State Bar and fuilure
to participate in this disciplinary proceeding before the DHC results in potential significant harm
to the profession and to the public. The legal profession is entrusted with the privilege of selfregulation. The State Bar can only regulate the profession if its members respond to inquiries of
the State Bar and otherwise participate. Defendant's failure to respond to the State Bar and
participate in this disciplinary proceeding before the DHC shows an unacceptable disregard for
the regulatory authority of the State Bar. Defendant's failure to participate in the profession's
self-regulation impedes effective self-regulation and jeopardizes the privilege of the profession
to remain self-regulating.
8.
Although the admonition to Defendant from the DHC in 05 DHC 17 was issued
twelve years ago, it is still significant because in both the 2005 order and in this order it is found
that Defendant failed to reconcile his trust account. Defendant's failure to cure a known
violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct for which he had been disciplined indicates a
disregard for this profession's self-regulation and the discipline imposed thereunder.
9.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and finds that suspension of
Defendant's license or a public censure, reprimand, or admonition would not be sufficient
discipline because of the gravity of the actnal and potential harm to his clients, the public, the
administration of justice, and the legal profession caused by Defendant's conduct, and the threat
of potential significant harm Defendant poses to the public.
10.
The Hearing Panel considered all lesser sanctions and finds that discipline short of
disbannent would not adequately protect the public for the following reasons;
a. Defendant repeatedly engaged in criminal acts reflecting adversely on his
honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer, and abused the trust placed in him
by his clients. Misappropriation of entrusted funds is among the most serious
misconduct in which an attorney can engage, and demonstrates the attorney is not
trustworthy;

b. Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to acknowledge the
seriousness of the offenses Defendant committed and would send the wrong
message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct expected of members
of the Bar of this State; and
c. The protection of the public and the legal profession requires that Defendant not
be permitted to resume the practice of law until he demonstrates the following:
that he has refonned; that he understands his obligations to his clients, the public,
and the legal profession; and that pennitting him to practice law will not be
detrimental to the public or the integrity and standing of the legal profession or
the administration of justice. Disbarred lawyers are required to make such a
showing before they may resume practicing law.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and additional Findings of
Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel hereby enters the
following
