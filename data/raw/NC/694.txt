caused by Hatch's conduct.

5. The court has considered lesser sanctions and dctemlined that any discipline short of
disbannent would not adequately protect the public for the following reasons:
a. Hatch's misconduct involves moral turpitude and violations of the public trust.

b. I-latch's misconduct involves misrepresentations and deceit. Misconduct
involving misrepresentations and deceit are among the most serious that an
attOJlley can commit.

c. Hatch's criminal offenses reflect adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness or
fitness as a lawyer.
d. Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to aclmowledge the
seriousness of the offenses and would send the wrong message to attomeys and to
the public regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar ofthis State.
e. Protection of the public and of the legal profession require that Hatch not be
permitted to resume the practice of law until he demonstrates the following: that he
has refonned; that he understands his obligations to his clients, the public, and the
legal profession; and that pennitting him to practice law will not be detrimental to
the public or the integrity and standing of the legal profession or the administration
ofjustice. Disbarred lawyers are required to make such a showing before they may
resume practicing law.

IT IS NOW, THEREFORE, ORDERED:
I. Jonathon Lee Hatch is DISBARRED from the practice oflaw in North Carolina.
2. This Order ofDisbannent is effective immediately upon entry.
