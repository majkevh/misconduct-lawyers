••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

I

This maner came on to be heard on February 3, 1994, and September 20, 1994.,
by a duly appointed hearing: committee comprised of Stephen T. Smith, Chairman;
Roben B. Smith, Jr.; and A. James Early,
and based upon the Stipulation on

m;

Preheating Col#ereDCe , the evidence presented at trial, and the arguments of counsel,
the comminee he~by enters the following:

-

General Statutes of North Carolina. and the RUles and Regulations

3.

During all times relevant hereto, Coleman was actively engaged in
. the practice of law in the Town of Hendersonville, Henderson
County, North Carolina.

4.

"

Cole~an represented the purchasers of a strUcturally damaged
house
a lawsuit against, altlong others, the seller, for, aIllong
other things, unfair or deceptive trade practices. The action was
styled Johnson v. Beverlv-Hanks & Associates. Inc ... et aI. anc:J was
filed with the Henderson Co~ty Clerk of Superior Court. After a.
pretrial hearing, the trial court entered summary judgment for the
seller on the unfair or deceptive trade practic~s issue. Thereafte~,
Coleman, on behalf of the purchasers, appeale,d to the North

m

Carolina Cburt of Appeals.

5.

On February 20, 1990, the Court of Appeals rendered.a decision
In the Johnson case, 97 N.C. App. 335 (1990). The relevant
ponion of the opinion is U follows:
Plaintiffs next alleged a claim for relief [against the,
seller] based upon G.S. sec. 75-1.1. this statute
regulates unfair an.d deceptive trade practices. To be
accountable to any party for: violating G.S. sec.
75-1.1, a defendant must be engaged in commerCe.
Homeowners are "private panies engaged i.p the sale
of [a] residence [and are] not involved in trade or
commerce and cannot beheld liable· under the
. stanlte. " [Citation omitted].

I

The undisputed facts establish that [the seller] was
merely a homeowner who li$ted her house for sale.
Based upon this, [the seller] cannot be liable for any
acts which might generally be considered ·.unfair or
dece:ptive trade practices.
97 N.C. App. at 344-345.

Judge Greene fIled a dissenting opinion concerning some of the
issues decided by the majority but did not dissent as to the unfair
or deceptive trade practices claim.

7.

On or about March 7, 1990, Coleman, on behalf of the purchasers,
fIled a Notice of Appeal and Petition for Discretionary Review
with the North Carolina Supreme Court. Coleman correctly
ipcluded the unfair or deceptive .trade practices issue in the', Petition
for Discretionary Review inStead of the Notice of Appeal since
there was no dissent on the unfair or de~eptive trade practices issue

and therefore, there was no right of appeal.

8.

On April S, 1990, the North Caroliila Supreme Court denied
Coleman's Petition for DisCICtionary Review. As of April S,
1~90, the unfair or deceptive trade 'practices issue was no longer

I

before the Supreme Court.
9.

On lune 13, 1990, Coleman filed a complaint on behalf of lames
800 (Henderson
lones styled lones v. Sumner, et al •• 90
County). The complaint alleged, among other things that the
sellers, Paul and Cheryl Luck, made false representations to Mr.:

evs

lQnes concerning the waterproofmg in the basement and the
I

garage.
10.

~ the fQuIth claim for relief, Coleman alleged that the false
I

representations by Mr. and Mrs. Luck "were in or affecting
commerce and constitute unfair or deceptive trade practices, which
are proscribed by Chapter 7S of the North Carolina General
statutes. "
'II.

•

At a hearing ~eld on November 26. 1990, on Mr. and Mrs. Luck's
motion to dismiss Jones' unfair or deceptive trade practices claim,
Coleman made the following misrepresentations to the coun
concerning the status of the Johnson case:

issue of whether or not a private vendor is engaged
in commerce and therefore, subject to ail lUlfair or
deceptive trade practice claim] is that vt;ryquestion
is now pending before the Nonh Carolina Supreme
Coun. . . . The question now pending before me
Nonh Carolina Supreme Court, and we are awaiting'
their decision on that; is: is [whether] listing the
propeny with a member of the Finn of a multiple
listing service, [places] the propeny beyond control
and dominion of the owner and in fact, places it in
the flow of commerce. . . . There's a case .pending
down in Raleigh right now to decide this verY point
and I would suggest that before Y01.1f Honor 1111es
either way on that, we might consider waiting and'
see what the Supreme'Court says, how they answer
that question and then I think this issue would be

.1

resolved by that.

•

In response to opposing counsel's argument tbat ~e unfair Qr
deceptive trade issue went to the Supreme Court on a Petition for .
Ceniorari from a unanjDiousopinion of the Court of Appea~s.
Coleman replied:
Your Honor, opposing Counsel stated that the
matter went to the Supreme Court on a Petition for
Ceniorari from a unanhnoU$ opinion of the Court of
Appeals. That is simply not true. There was a
o;ssenting opinion that was rather lengthy in the·
. Coun of Appeals and 'it was an appeal of right to the
Supreme Coun and the dissenting opinion of the
Coun of Appeals took the position that ~ am now
taking and we simply need to ~ai~ and, see which
way the Supreme Court goes.
They've been
wrestling with it down there for a right good while.

,or should have known, that the issue of whether or not a private
homeowner was engaged in commerce was not before the Supreme
'Court.

In 1989, Lynn Murray hired the rum of 'toms and Bazzle, P.A.
(hereinafter "the Film") to .represent her in a domestic action
against Kenneth R. MUIl'3y. Eugene M. Carr. m. an' associate of
the Firm, prepared and tiled a complaint seeking child custody,
:child suppon, alimony and otbcr reJief. Soon after the action was
filed, a temporary coment Older was entered into between the
i
•
:Murrays, who ul~tely obtaiDed a divorce in 1990.

14.

:Even though certain domestic property claims were pending, Ms.

15.

Murray terminated her relatiaoship with dle Firm and on May 5,
1990, retained the services of Coleman. On January 18, 1991,
Coleman, oil behalf of Ms. Murray, filed a civil action in
Henderson' County Superior Court against Ervin W. Bazzle,

I

Eugene M. Carr, m, James B. Toms, and their respective firms.
styled Murrav v. :Bazzle. et aI•• 91 CVS 72 (Henderson County)
(hereafter "the state case"). The complaint alleged that the
defendants wrongfully widJbeld t;lic:nt fumts, committed
professional malpractice, and committed various felonies.
16.

On or about October 24. 1991. Coleman tiled an amended
complaint against the same defendants in federal COM pursuant to
28 U.S.C. Sec. 198~, styled Murrav.v. Bazzle. et al•• No.

alleged in ,paragraph n of the first claim for relief that the

In paragraph 14, subparagraphs (a) through' (p)of the amended
complaint, Coleman, on behalf of his client, made 16 allegations
of conspiracy between the defendants and the above described state

officials and agencies.

I

18.

On December 9, 1991, defendants filed an aJlSwer denying any
wrongdoing, several motions to disntiss, and a motion pursuant to
Rule 11 of the Rules of Federal procedure fot sanctions.

19.

In order to state a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983,
Coleman was reqUired to allege specific facts tending to show (1)
deprivation of a constitutional risht or privilege (2) by a person
acting under color of state law. Private defendants, such as 'Ms.
Murray's fonner attorneys. arc fiot liable under 42 U.S.C. Sec.
1983 unless the plainnff alleges specific facts tending' to Sl:1ow a
conspiracy between the private defendants and state officials.

•

On December 29, 1992, the Honorable Richard L. Voc;;rhee$,:
Chief Judge, United StateS District: Court, Western District of'
North .Carolina, entered a Memorandum of Opinion and Order
which held that the allegations contained in the amended complaint
were insufficient to suppon the existence of such a conspiracy. '
Consequently, Jlldge Voorhees Vclnted the defenctan~' motion to
dismiss the flISt claiIn for relief (conspiracy claiIn) for failure to
state a cause of action and a~o granted the defendants 'motion to
dismiss the remaining claims for lack of jurisdiction.
On February 8, 1993. a hearing was hf;ld on th~ deff;ndants'
motion for sanctions. At the hearing, .Coleman conceded that he
