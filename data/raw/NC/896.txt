******************************
This matter was scheduled to be heard on May 6, 20 I0 upon an Order to Show
Cause issued to Raymond Marshall on March 3 I, 20 I O. The North Carolina State Bar
was directed 10 investigate the matter and presenl evidence in the show cause hearing,
The North Carolina State Bar is represented by A. Root Edmonson and Raymond
Marshall appears pro se. Based upon the consent of those participating in this matter
before the Court, the undersigned makes the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT

I.
Between March 15,2010 and March 18,2010, Raymond Marshall
represented Tonesha Meekins in a criminal trial in Forsyth County Superior Courl before
the presiding judge, the Honorable Catherine C. Eagles.
2.
Throughout the trial, Raymond Marshall repeatedly argued with Judge
Eagles, both inside and outside the presence of the jury, about the Court's rulings despite
several warnings from Judge Eagles not 10 continue 10 argue with the Court about rulings
the Court had made.
3.
In addition 10 arguing with Judge Eagles, Raymond Marshall repeatedly
made non-verbal expressions ofms disapproval of the Court's rulings and repeatedly
attempted to tell or imply to the jury that the Court's rulings were preventing him from
putting evidence before the jury.
4.
Raymond Marshall repeatedly interrupled Judge Eagles, both in and outside
the presence of the jury, despite warnings from the Court.
5.
Raymond Marshall repeatedly expressed personal statements of opinion
during both his opening statement and his closing argument even after having been
warned by Judge Eagles not to express his personal opinion. Because Raymond Marshall
would not heed Judge Eagles' warnings, Judge Eagles had to terminate Raymond
Marshall's closing argument on behalf of his client.
6.
After Raymond Marshall advised Judge Eagles that he was experiencing bad
back pain, Judge Eagles allowed Raymond Marshall to examine witnesses from a
standing position rather than remaining seated at counsel table as is the normal

requirement under Rule 12 of the General Rules of Practice. However, Judge Eagles
instructed Raymond Marshall to stand still behind counsel table.
7.
Raymond Marshall repeatedly walked around the well ofthe courtroom
while examining witness despite Judge Eagles' repeated instructions to remain still while
standing.
8.
Raymond Marshall was late returning to the courtroom on more than one
occasion, causing everyone in the courtroom, including jurors, to have to wait for his
arrival. Raymond Marshall was again late even after being warned by Judge Eagles to be
in the courtroom on time.
9.
Raymond Marshall repeatedly attempted to place facts not in evidence
before the jury by making statements to the jury about things that were not supported by
any evidence that had been presented to the jury. Raymond Marshall continued to do this
even after being repeatedly warned by Judge Eagles not to do it again. As an example,
Raymond Marshall made statements to the jury about the lack of a transcript of an earlier
hearing that implied to the jury that the State or the Court had deprived the defendant of
that transcript in an effort to hide something when in fact the transcript was not available
because Raymond Marshall waited too late to order the transcript.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the undersigned makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.
By arguing with Judge Eagles about the Court's rulings, by making non·
verbal expressions of his disapproval of the Court's rulings, by telling or implying to the
jury that the Court's rulings were preventing him from putting evidence before the jury,
by interrupting Judge Eagles, by expressing personal opinions in his opening statement
and closing argument, by walking around the well of the courtroom while examining
witnesses, by returning to court late, and by attempting to place facts not in evidence
before the jury by making statements to the jury about things that were not supported by
any evidence, Raymond Marshall violated Rule 12 of the General Rules of Practice
regarding courtroom decorum.
2.
By his repeated violations of Rule 12 of the General Rules of Practice,
Raymond Marshall engaged in undignified or discourteous conduct that was degrading to
the tribunal in violation of Rule 3.5(a)(4)(B) ofthe Rules of Professional Conduct and
intentionally and habitually violated established rules of procedure in violation of Rule
3.5(a)(4)(C) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, both of which constituted conduct
intended to disrupt the tribunal.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and upon the
consent of the parties, the undersigned also finds the following:

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.

Raymond Marshall has substantial experience in the practice oflaw.

2.
Raymond Marshall has not previously been disciplined by the North
Carolina State Bar.
3.

Raymond Marshall's conduct was not motivated by personal gain.

4.
Raymond Marshall's conduct occurred in open court where it was observed
by other court personnel and the public.

5.
Raymond Marshall's conduct directly demeaned the respect to which the
Court was entitled.
6.
Raymond Marshall's disrespect for the Court that he exhibited to the public
harmed the legal profession as a whole.
7.

During the Meekins trial, Raymond Marshall suffered from severe back

pam.
8.
During the Meekins trial, Raymond Marshall was also distracted by concern
for a family member who was undergoing tests for a potentially serious medical
condition during the week of the trial.
Based upon the Findings of Fact, the Conclusions of Law, the Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline and the consent of the parties, the undersigned also enters the
following:

CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.

2.

Raymond Marshall's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:

(a)

substantial experience in the practice o~

(b)

multiple offenses during the eel:Ii'f!rofthe trial, especially after having
been warned;

(c)

the negative impact his conduct had on the administration ofjustice
and the public's perception of the legal profession.

CC143'lS'

Raymond Marshall's misconduct is mitigated by the following factors:
(a)

a frank admission of the wrongfulness ofltis conduct;

(b)

the absence of a prior disciplinary record;

(c)

the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive;

(d)

the effect his own personal discomfort and the concern for his family
member's health had on his conduct.

3.
In weighing whether Raymond Marshall's conduct warrants a suspension of
his license, the most important consideration is to prevent similar conduct in the future.
Because Raymond Marshall's personal discomfort and the distraction relating to his
family member's medical condition are not likely to again converge to affect his conduct
in the future, a suspension is not warranted.
4.
The harm to the administration ofjustice and the protection of the public can
be accomplished by imposition of a censure.
Based upon the Findings of Fact, the Conclusions of Law, the Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the Conclusions Regarding Discipline and the consent of the
parties, the undersigned also enters the following:
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
I.
Raymond Marshall is hereby CENSURED for his misconduct during the
course of the trial of State v. Meekins.
2.
A copy ofthis order shall be filed in Forsyth County as is any other
Censure issued by the North Carolina State Bar.
