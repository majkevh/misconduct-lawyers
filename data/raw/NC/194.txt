BASED UPON the foregoing FINDfNGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, and the

Fn~DlNGS

1.	

2.	

AND CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

Spransy's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
(a)

A pattern of misconduct;

(b)

Multiple offenses; and

(c)

Substantial experience in the practice of law.

Spransy's misconduct is mitigated by the following factors:
(a)

Absence of a prior disciplinary record;

(b)

Absence of a dishonest or selfish motive;

(c)

Personal or emotional problems;

(d)	

Interim rehabilitation; and

(e)	

Remorse.

3.	

The mitigating factors outweighed the aggravating factors.

4.	

Prior to the relevant time of his misconduct, Spransy was experiencing significant
personal problems in his life that caused him to suffer from depression.

5.	

In 2006, Spransy sought treatment for his depression from a psychiatrist. Spransy
took medication for two months. Spransy also began therapy with a clinical
psychologist, Dr. Matthew Alexander, Ph.D. M.A. who he saw until the Fall of
2007.

6.	

Just prior to the time of his misconduct, Spransy became erratic in the taking of his
medication due its unpleasant side effects. The lack of appropriate medication
contributed to Spransy's loss ofjudgment that led to his misconduct.

7.	

Spransy's conduct is serious enough to wanant more than a Censure, but
does not warrant an active suspension of his license.
