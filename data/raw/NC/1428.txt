Defepdant

This cause was heard by the undersigned duly appointed
members of a Hearing Committee of the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission of the North Ca'rolina State Bar on Friday, February
22, 1985. The Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar was
represented by David k. JOhnson. The befendant was not present
and was not represented. In addition to the FINDINGS OF FACT ANP
CONCLUSION$, 'OF LAW entered in this cause, the Plaintiff presented
evidence in the disciplinary phase of the proceedings which is
summa'rized as f0110ws::
,

On October 27, 1~84, the Defendant wr9te to the Bar and
advis'ed that $5000 hap been tendered to atto.rney W. Thomas White,
attorney for th'e admirlistrator.S of the e.sta te of Anna Ruth
Miller, as funds due the estate from those funds he had received
in December, 1~79, upon the sale of th~ r~~~ p~operty. 'Ttle $5000
was delivered py bank check issued o-n' f~nds 'from the Wade Hobson
"trust account:" The Defendant also p~ovided th&~ar with a
letter from th~ bank cert.ifying that his "trust account" had a
balance in ~xcess of ~7000 after the withdrawal of' the '$~OOO paid
te:> the estate. The bank statements of tl1e Defendant's bank
9.ccount clearly show ;that ·the Defendant did not deposit the
$2.8.,75'0 in proceeds from the sale of the property in question in
the i1trust account" ih December, 1979.
In fact, the account
records show that the account balance in the Defendant's account
never exceeded $15,000 at any time since December, 1979, and, on
occasion, the account balance was negative. As recently as
January,. 1985, the Defendant issued checks on the acc;:ount which
. were returned for ihsuf'ficient funds.
Further, the Defendant was
given additional time by the attorney for the esta·te to prove how
much waS owed to the estate in November, 1984, and the Defendant
has failed to provide any information to the attorney~ Thus, it
appears that the Defehdant still cannot account for the fundS
received in light of ~his proceeding and has not retained those
funds in his fiduciary capacity.
