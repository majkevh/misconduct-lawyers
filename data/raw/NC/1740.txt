On July a" '1993, the Grievance ComT11ittee of, the North
Carolina State Bar ~et and considered the Sriev~nce filed aga1nst
you by the Nor~h
Carolina State Bar.,
,
Pursuant to section 13 (A) of art.icle IX of the Rul~s a:rld
Regulat:.ions of the North Carolina State Bar, the Grievance
Committee co~ducted a preliminary hearing. After considering; the
information ava·ilable to i,t, includ,ing your respopse to t h e · ·
letter of notice, the Grievance Committee foundprbbable cause. '
Probable cause ,is d~f.ined in the rules <;is it reasonable cause. t.O .
believe that a membe:r of the North Carolina State --Bar is guil,ty
of misconduct justifying disc~pJ.inary action."
. The rules provide that after a finding of'probable'cause,
the Grievance Comm:i,ttee may determin~ that the filing of a
complaint and a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing'
Commission are not required and the Grievance Committee may ist:;l,ue
various lev~ls of discipline depending upon the miscond~ct, the
actl.l.al or poteritial injury caused, and any aggravating or
mitigating fact;orS!.', ~he Grievance Committee may.issue an
'admonition, reprimand, or censure to the respondent attorney.
A repriT11and is ~ written fo~ of discipline more serious
than an admonition issued in cases in which an attorney has
violated one or more provisions of the Rules of ~rofessional
Conduct and has' caused harm or potential harm tq"a' cJ.ient, the
'. a.dministration :of jtlstice, the prafes'sion, or a member of the
. pl,lblic, but the miscond,uct does not require a censure.
,

"

.

The Grievance Committee was of the opinion that, a censure is
not required in this case and is/?ues this reprimand to 'you. As
.chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State
Bar, it is now my duty to issue this reprimand and I am certaip.
that you will l,lnderstand fully the spirit in which this dl.ity is
performed.

conditions.', -

I,

Your cpnduct in optaining qontrolled substances by fraud
violated Ru~Le 1.2 (B) and Rule 1.2 (C) of the Rules of Professional,
Conduct. Hbwever" the committee was cognizant of the fact that
the a,ddiction which caused your misconduc,t occurred from
prescriptio~ medication, rather ~han from experimentation with
illegal drugs. The committee also recognized that you
experienced substantial ~mQ.tional. difficulties whi'chcontributed
to your condition and was impressed that you are 'continuing ,to
seek treatm~nt ~nd counseling. In light of these ~itigating .
factqrs, th!= Qommi.ttee elected to issue you a reprimand, rat;her,
than issue ~ censUre or send the matter to the bisciplinary
Hearing,Commission for trial.

You are hereby reprimanded by the North Carolini? State-~ar,:~~:,,;

the high ethical standards of' the legal profession.

I'
