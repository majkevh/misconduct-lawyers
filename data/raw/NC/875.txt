5.
From 2000 through May 31, 2010, Defendant practiced law with the finn
Hamrick, Bowen, Mebane & Lloyd, LLP ("HBML") in Rutherfordton, North Carolina.
Defendant left HBML effective May 31, 201 O.
6.
During the time Defendant was a member of HBML, Robert L. Mebane
("Mebanc") was also a member of the law firm. Beginning in 2008 through May 31, 2010,
Defendant and Mebane were the only members ofHBML.
7.
In 2008 through May 31, 2010, HBML had two trust accounts: a) a real estate
trust accotmt with RBC Centum, account number ending 1230 CRBC 1230"); and b) a general
trust accmmt with BB&T, account munber ending 1837 ("BB&T 1837"). Both Defendant and
Mebane had signature authority to write checks on BB&T 1837 and entrusted funds were held in
the account.
8.
During the period 2008 through May 31, 2010, Defendant did not conduct
monthly or quarterly reconciliations ofBB&T 1837.
9.
Between October 1,2008 and May 31, 2010, Defendant signed and issued checks
on BB&T 1837 without identitying on the checks the client balance against which the checks
were drawn.
10.
In or about 2008, HBML's business operations account used for finn operational
transactions was closed.
11.
Defcndant became aware in 2008 that trust account BB&T 1837 was being used
for operational expenses. Defendant's personal funds were commingled with hust account funds
in BB&T 1837 in order to cover usage of the trust account for operational expenses.
12.
Beginning in or about 2008 and continuing lmtil the time Defendant left the firm,
a ledger was maintained to tmck HBML operational transactions through BB&T 1837. Ledger
cards for clients with entrusted funds in BB&T 1837 were also maintained.
13.
In the fall of 2008, Defendant learned HBML had not met its obligations to pay
federal income tax withholding for its employees for the first three quarters of2008.
14.
On or about November 10,2008, Defendant signed and issued check no. 21176 in
the amount of $13,437.03 drawn against BB&T 1837 and made payable to the Internal Revenue
Service (hereinafter "IRS") for overdue incomc tax withholding.
15.
On November 18,2008, when check no. 21176 cleared BB&T 1837, HMBL did
not have sufficient funds belonging to HBML in the account to cover the check.
On November 26,2008, Defendmlt deposited $13,437.03 of his personal funds
16.
into BB&T 1837 to cover check no. 21176. Defendant commingled personal funds with trust
account funds to replenish the trust account for the check written to the IRS.

2

17.
Defendant used entrusted client funds to cover check no. 21176 and pay HBML's
withholding tax obligation.
18.
On December 17, 2009, check no. 21565, signed by Mebane, was drawn on
BB&T 1837 in the amount of $173.10 and paid through BB&T 1837. The check was made
payable to a restaurant to pay for a staff holiday luncheon.
19.
At the time check no. 21565 was drawn against BB&T 1837, I-IBML did not have
sufficicnt funds belonging to HBML in the account to cover the amount of the check. Entrusted
funds were used to pay for the staff luncheon.
20.
On December 21, 2009, Defendant's personal check in the amount of $86.55 was
deposited to BB&T 1837 to cover Defendant's portion of the luncheon expense. Defendant
commingled personal funds with trust account funds to replenish the trust account for his part of
the check written for the luncheon.
21.
On or about June 2,2009, Defendant depositcd $95,270.69 to BB&T 1837. These
were entrusted funds of the KN. Estate held on behalf of Defendant's client RH which had been
named administrator of the KN. Estate.
22.
After Defendant deposited the entrusted funds of the K.N. Estate to BB&T 1837,
he withdrew attorney fees from the estate funds on two occasions so that as of August 17, 2009,
$94,070.69 of the K.N. Estate entrusted funds remained to be disbursed.
23.
In or about March or April 2010, an employee of HMBL told Defendant she
suspected Mebane had misappropriated money from BB&T 1837.
24.
As a result of the employee's information, Defendant looked into Mebane's
disbursements from BB&T 1837. After examining BB&T 1837, Defendant confronted Mebane
about checks drawn on the nust account by Mebane that Dcfendant deemed suspicious.
25.
Between the time Defendant confi'onted Mebane and May 31, 2010, Mebane told
Defendant he (Mebane) had replenished BB&T 1837 for everything Mebane had taken out of the
trust account.
26.
By late May 2010, Defendant lmew and had information to reasonably believe
that Mebane had misappropriated or misapplied entrustcd funds from BB&T 1837.
27.
With information to know and reasonably believe that Mebane had
misappropriated or misapplied entrusted funds from BB&T 1837, Defendant did not inform the
North Carolina State Bar about Mebane's conduct.
28.
For extended periods of time between June 2, 2009 and the time Defendant
confronted Mebanc about Mebane's misappropriation from BB&T 1837, the balance of BB&T
1837 dropped well below $94,070.69, the balance of the KN. Estate fuuds that should have been
in the account.

3

29.
After Defendant separated from HBML on May 31, 2010, Defendant left the K.N.
Estate funds for which RH was Administrator in BB&T 1837 even though Defendant had
information to reasonably believe that Mebane bad misappropriated or misapplied entrusted
funds from BB&T 1837and that Mebane had signature authority on BB&T 1837.

On October 21, 2010, Defendant wTote the following checks against BB&T 1837

c.

By issuing checks on BB&T 1837 without identifying on the checks the client
balance against which the checks were drawn, Defendant violated Rule 1.153(b)(2);

d.

By using entrusted funds to pay HBML's withholding tax obligation, Defendant
used entrusted funds for his own benefit and for the benefit of third parties other
than the beneficial owners ofthat property in violation of Rule 1.15-2(j);

betrays a vital trust that clients and the public place in attorneys and the legal profession.

the Rules of Professional Conduct.

3.
Defendant's client notified Defendant that its check in the amount of $71,340.32

funds demonstrates a lack of trustworthiness on the part of Defendant in dealing with difficult
circumstances.

By failing to report Mebane's conduct to the State Bar and leaving entrusted
funds of the K.N Estate in the untrustworthy hands of Mebane, Defendant elevated his own
interests above those of his client RH.

client funds and assets even though he intended, and had made arrangements, to reimburse the
trust account for the check he wrote to the IRS.

demonstrated greater responsibility for the trust account.

County Superior Court enj oining him fi'om accepting, receiving or having custody or control of
any fiduciary funds until further order of the cornt.

Based on the Findings of Faet and Conclusions of Law above and the additional Findings
of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fmms of discipline
available to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel ha, considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. IB ยง .01l4(w)(I) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and
concludes the following factors are present:
a.

Circumstances reflecting Dcfendant's hick of trustworthiness;

b.

Elevation of the Defendant's own interest above that of his client;

c..

Negative impact of Defendant's actions on client's or public's perception of the
profession; and

d.

Impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the representation.

2.
The I-Iearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
IE ยง .OII4(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the NOlth Carolina State Bar and concludes the
following factor is present:
a.

Misappropriation of client assets to which Defendant was not entitled.

3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all ofthe factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
IB ยง .OII4(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations ofthe NOlth Carolina State Bar and concludes the
following factors are applicable in this matter:
a.

Defendant's selfish motive;

b.

Defendant's condnct resulted in multiple offenses;

c.

Defendant's full and free disclosure to the Hearing Panel and cooperative attitude
toward the proceedings;

d.

Defendant's good general character and reputation;

e.

Defendant's experience in the practice of law; and

f.

Otherpenaities or sanctions in the form of a comt order enjoining Defendant from

4.
The Hearing Panel has considered issuing an admonition, reprimand or censure
but concludes that such discipline would not be sufficient discipline. The Panel concludes that
such discipline would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the violations committed by

7

Defendant and send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct
expected of members of the Bar in this State.
5.
The Hearing Panel considered disbarment but concludes that considering all the
circumstances of this case disbarment is not necessary to protect the public or the profession in
this matter.
6.
The Hearing Panel has considered all alternatives and concludes that a suspension
is necessary to adequately protect the public. The Hearing Panel finds that an order imposing
discipline short of suspension would not be appropriate.
