promulgated thereunder.

5. Defendant charged and Lancaster paid Defendant $2,500 for the
representation.
6. On or about 25 September 2015, Lancaster leamed from Wood that Defendant
had previously represented Wood's ex-husband in an unrelated domestic matter against
Wood.
7. Although Defendant represented Wood's ex-husband in the domestic matter,
Wood and her ex-husband had since reconciled.
8. At the time of Defendant's representation of Lancaster, Lancaster considered
both Wood and Wood's ex-husband as her adversaries in the civil matter.
9. Lancaster ended Defendant's representation of her out of concems about his
ability to be loyal to his representation of her given his prior representation of Wood's
ex-husband.
10. On or about 17 October 2015, Lancaster filed a Petition for Resolution of
Disputed Fee ("Fee Dispute Petition").
11. Pursuant to the Fee Dispute Petition, Lancaster sought the retum of the $2,500
fee she had paid Defendant because she was concemed that Defendant's prior
representation of Wood's ex-husband negatively affected his loyalty to his
representation of Lancaster.
12. Defendant submitted his response to the Fee Dispute Petition on or about 29
October 2015.
13. In his response to the Fee Dispute Petition, Defendant denied engaging in
misconduct, stated that he had earned according to the written fee agreement the fee
Lancaster paid, and attached to his response a 23 September 2015 Hayes Law Firm
Agreement which he represented as the fee agreement between him and Lancaster ("the
agreement").
14. "T. Lancaster" is on the signature line at the bottom of the agreement
purporting to represent the signature of Lancaster.
15. Lancaster did not sign the agreement Defendant attached to his response to
the Fee Dispute Petition.
16. Defendant handwrote "T. Lancaster" on the agreement he submitted in
support of his response to the Fee Dispute Petition to falsely represent the signature as
Lancaster's.
17. Defendant was successful in his effort to have the Fee Dispute Petition
dismissed.
18. On 15 January 2016, a grievance file was opened against Defendant alleging
in part that Defendant handwrote Lancaster's signatnre on the agreement he provided
in support of his response to the Fee Dispute Petition.

allegation that he handwrote Lancaster's signature on the agreement.
20. On or about 25 May 2016, Defendant was provided with the opinion of a
handwriting expert that Lancaster did not sign the agreement.
21. After being provided with the handwriting expert's opinion about the
signature on the agreement, Defendant admitted that he had written Lancaster's
signature on the agreement.
Based upon the consent of the parties and the foregoing Findings of Fact, the
Hearing Panel enters the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.
All parties are properly before the Hearing Panel, and the Panel has
jurisdiction over Defendant, Shaun L. Hayes, and over the subject matter.
2.
Defendant's conduct, as set forth in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes
grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(2) in that Defendant
violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as follows:
a) By submitting the agreement bearing a false, handwritten signature in
support of his response to the Fee Dispute Petition, Defendant engaged in
conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in violation
of Rule 8.4(c);
b) By handwriting "T. Lancaster" on the agreement with the intent to falsely
represent it as Lancaster's signature, Defendant engaged in conduct involving
dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c); and
c) By denying in his response to the grievance complaint the allegation that
he handwrote Lancaster's signature, Defendant knowingly made a false
statement of material fact in connection with a disciplinary matter in violation
of Rule 8.1(a), and engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or
misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c).
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and the
consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel hereby makes by clear, cogent, and convincing
evidence the following:

professional colleagues.

Based upon the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the
Additional Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, and with the consent of the pal1ies, the
Hearing Panel makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27 N.C.
Admin. Code 1B ยง .0114(w)(I) and concludes that the following factors that warrant
suspension or disbarment are present:
(a) Intent ofthe defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential harm is
foreseeable;
(b) Circumstances reflecting the defendant's lack of honesty, trustwolihiness,
or integrity;
(c) Elevation of the defendant's own interest above that of the client;

of the profession;
(e) Negative impact ofthe defendant's actions on the administration of

2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27 N.C.
Admin. Code 1B ยง .OI14(w)(2) and concludes that the following factor exists that
warrants consideration of disbarment:
(a) Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all ofthe factors contained in 27 N.C.
Admin. Code 1B ยง .OI14(w)(3) and concludes that the following are applicable in this
matter:
(a) Absence of prior disciplinary offenses;
(b) Good character and reputation;
(c) Remorse; and
(d) Defendant has been licensed to practice law for approximately thirteen
years.
4.
By choosing to engage in dishonest conduct, Defendant caused significant
potential harm to the legal profession.

5.
By providing false documentation in support of his response to the fee
dispute petition, Defendant caused harm to Lancaster.

6.
By initially providing a false response to the grievance complaint,
Lancaster caused harm to the attorney self-regulation process and thus, the legal
profession and to Lancaster in that she had to incur the cost of a handwriting expert.
7.
The Hearing Panel considered disbarment, but determined that disbarment
is not warranted because: (i) Defendant has no prior discipline, (ii) his misconduct was
isolated, (iii) his misconduct did not cause significant harm, though it created the
potential for significant harm to the profession, and (iv) Defendant made restitution to
Lancaster for the harm caused to her by his misconduct.
8.
The Hearing Panel has considered all lesser sanctions including: censure,
reprimand, and admonition, and finds that discipline less than suspension would not
adequately protect the public fi'om Defendant's future misconduct because of the harm
caused to his client and the gravity of potential significant harm Defendant's conduct
caused to the profession.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline,
and on the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
