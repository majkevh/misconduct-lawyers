Byrd paid all dues and fees owed to the North Carolina State Bar.

·11. In 1974, Byrd gra<iuated from the School of Law at the University of North Carolina
and joined his father ~nd uncle in the practice oflaw in Morganton, NCat the firm of Byrd, Byrd,
Ervin and Blanton.

I

12. Byrd rem~ined with his family's firm uptil1977 when he ~eft to start his own
pr~ctiGe. Although he someti~es practiced in association with one or more other attorneys, from
1983 through 1994 he was a solo practitioner in Morganton where he engaged in a general
practice with special emphasis on criminal law.
13. In 1989, Byrd started a small grading contracting bu~iness with one of his brothers.
This business soon became a financial drain rather than a benefit.
14. In 1990, Byrd's wife developed breast cancer that she battled until her death in
1999. Her medical insurance was canceled in 1992, which placed an increasing financial drain .
qn Byrd's financial resources. The Byrds had three daughters who were in' coll~ge during this
period of time.
15. In 1993, Byrd was offered an opportunity to purchase some heavy grading
equipment at a price that he knew was "too goqd" to be legitimate. Nonetheless, and in an effort
to support the struggling business, he made the purchase. Later that year, the grading contracting
business closed for good.

I

16. In 1994, a former client of Byrd's approached him about assisting her in selling
some marijuana. This w~s an effort directed by local law enforcement officers who taped
conversations between the two. Although Byrd refused his fortner client's offers on eighteen
occasions, he finally agreed to assist her in distributing a quantity of marijuana. On the night that
.
the transfer of marijuana occurred at Byrd's house, he Was arrested.

.

17. On August 1, 1994, Byrd was indicted in the United States District Court for the
Western District of North Carolina on three counts relating to possessing, attempting to posses
and conspiracy to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute.
18. On September 9, 1994, Byrd entered a guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to
possess marijuana with the intent to distribute.
19. On October 17, 1994, Byrd tendered the surrender of his NC law license to the
Council of the North Carolina State Bar by affidavit that admitted that he WaS guilty of
conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute between 20 and 40 kilograms of marijuana.
20.

I

On. October 21, 1994, the Council accepted Byrd's tender Qflicense and Byrd was

disbarred.
21. On March 14, 1995, Judge Richard L. Voorhees sentenced Byrd to a prison term of
j4 moIiths with 3 years of superVised release to follow the prison term.
22. !In early 1998, Byrd was released to a halfway house in Raleigh, NC. Initially, and
as part ofhis~probation, Byrd worked for a landscaping business in Raleigh and completed 100
hours of community service with the Food Bank of North Carolina. Later that year, Byrd started
working in tbe law office of former U.S. Senator Robert Morgan as a paralegal and continued to
volunteer at the Food Bank ~fter his required service was completed. Byrd continued to work for
Robert Morgan's law firm after his release from his active prison sentence.

I

23. :in 1999, for his continuing service to the Food Bank, Byrd received the first Golden
I
Pallet Award from the Food Bank. This award has become an annual award for the Food Bank's
most outstanding volunteer.
24.

While Byrd was working for Robert Morgan, he was again indicted iIi the United
States Distri~t Court for the Western District of North Carolina for aiding and abetting the
ttansportatioh of stolen goods in interstate commerce. The conduct charged in this indictment
occurred in 1993 and involved the purchase of the heavy grading equipment that he purchased
that year. .
I

25. On July 13, 1999, upon Byrd's guilty plea, Judge Lacy H. Thornburg, after finding
that the gov¢rnnient's failure to indict :(3yrd earlier on this charge called for a doWnward
departure, sentenced Byrd to time served and placed Byrd on supervised release for two years.
Judge Thornburg also ordered Byrd to pay $138,189.29 in restitution. Robert Morgan was a
witness for Byrd in that proceeding, and Byrd continued to work as a. paralegal in his firm after
this proceedtng was concluded.
26. In late 1999, Byrd determined that he needed to return to the county where he had
been reared,;where he had practiced
successfully for many years, and where the events and
publicity that led to his disbarment had occurred. Byrd moved back home to Drexel, NC where
he has rema~ned to the present time ..

27 .. When he returned to Burke County, Byrd initially worked as a paralegal in the law
office ofC.

pary Triggs.

office of Lewis B. Waddell. Byrd remained with Waddell until 2001 when Waddell developed
liver problems that required him to close his law office.

31. Upon his return to Burke County, Byrd became very active in his home church,
I)rex~l First Baptist Church. He has been active in the choir and setvedon and chaired a number
of committees. However, his biggest commitment of time at Drexel Baptist was in formation of
A WANA. This is a church related activity that reaches out to teenagers in the community who
are considered "at risk.'; It has grown to where there .are as many as 30-40 young people engaged
in this program at any given time. Byrd has recently been elected a Deacon of Drexel First
Baptist Church.
32. In addition to his work in the church; Byrd has been active in the community,
particularly in helping the elderly with repairs to their homes, taking thel11 shopping or simply in
visiting with them.
33. On many occasions since his return to Burke County, Byrd has shared the story of
his "downfall" to community citizens with whom he visits or talks with in day-to ..day Hving.
However, his most frequent "testimonials" have occurred in connection with his work with the
youth in the AW ANA program where he hopes they can benefit from his lesson that temptation
is constant and the opportunity to fall is always present.
34. The hearing committee heard testimony from Sen. Morgan, foriner Superior Court
Judge Forrest Ferrell, Burke County District Court Judges John R. ,Mull and Charles T. Edwards,
Burke County lawyers Daniel Kuehnert and M. Alan LaCroy, and Mr. Charles K Taylor, a long
time citizen and resident of Burke County, in which they expressed their opinions' that Byrd's
reinstatement would not be detrimental to the integrity and standing of the bar or to the
administration of justice.

I

35. In addition, the hearing committee considered letters recommending Byrcl's
reinstatement from the present Clerk of Superior Court of Burke County, the present Register of
Deeds of Burke County, the Sheriff of Burke County, the Chief of Police of Drexel and the
fonner Chief of Police of Drexel (some of whom were involved in the investigation and
prosecution afByrd:) The same recommendation was expressed by 55 other elected offiCials,
lawyers, and citizens of Burke County.
