PUBLIC CENSURE

WILLIAM I. WOOTEN,
ATTORNEY AT LAW

)
)

I

At its regular quarterly meeting on July 23, 1986, the Grievance ,
Go~ttee of the North Carolina State Bar conducted a preliminary hearing
under Section 13 of the Discipline and Disbarment Rules of thl? Nor~h Car6;I.ii1~
State Bar. regarding a grievance f:i,led against you by the North Carolina St'a:f:e
Bar. The Committee considered all of the evidence before it, inCl,tlQ.ihg :yo1,i~
written statement to the Committee. Pursuant to Sect:!:on13(0) of ·tl).e "
Discipline and Disbarment Rules, the Commi~tee found probable c~use.' Probable
cause is defined under the Discipline and Disbarment Rules as': "A finding by ,
th~ Grievance Committee that there ;is reasonable cause to be~ieve that ~
m~mber of the North Caro1.ina State Bar is guilty of misconduct justifying
disciplinary action." The rules also provide that if, a,fter a f:!:nding Q'J;.
probable cause, the Committee dete;rmines that a complainta-6da h.earing ;l,,:i?e,
not wal'ranted, the COtIimit,tee may issue a public censur~ uP9n the a'cceptance' «;>1;, '
tl).e same by the attorney. That determ±nationhas been mad~bythe G9i:mni,tt;'ee'
and the Committee issuestllis Public Censure 'to you.

'

.

As Chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North Caro;I.ina' Stat'e', ~~i;'
it is now my duty to issue this Public Censu,re. I am certain t'h~t YQtl:w'il~ " '
llnderstand fully the spirit in whlchthis d~ty is perfomn~d. The f::tctj::,Plat '~,'"
public censure is ,not thl? mostseriol,ls discipline that $ay be, imposed b.y,'t,h¢
North Carolina s.tate Bar Sllould not be taken by you to :l,11'd:i.ca~e t'hat any ,
member of the Co~ittee feels that your conduct was excusabie or less thart a
serious and substantial viqlation of the Rules of Pr.ofe'ssiortal Conduct aJld t.he
law of the State of North Carolina.

,

On January 30, 1986, you executed an affidavi·t tor submis'~~on to the,
Gri,evance Committee of the North Carolina St'at~ Bar insuppoi't of a gri~va:nce:
fileq ,by Charles Hugh McGowal1, Jr. and Janice M. Barbre af5ainst anoth~:t; fn¢li1be:t;
of the Pitt County Bar. In your affid~vit you asserted'th~t th~ subject'
attorney "purposely mislead you" to accept the wordi.ng of a subordi.nat;ion
agrl?ement in a deed of trust which apparently requir~d the subordin~~ibn' Qf
your clients' lien to a much greater extent than had been cOl1te1ll,pla:ted bYtll~"
pa.rties in negotiating the transaction. You indicateq in your affidav.it tpat
since you trl,lsted that the subject attorney would insert the "understood ,anc1
appropriate" clause, you failed to read the provision in de,pth but rath~r "
glanced hurriedly at the proferl'ed language., You further indicated t.hat.YOi!
believed you had been "victimized by the misl;epresentation of a fe;Llow
.
attorney."

Subsequently., on April 3, 1986, yOti executed another affidavit concerning
the s1,lbj.ect attorney's conduct. In that affidavit, which was executed at the
behest of the accused laWyer and was ultimately submitted to the Grievance
Committee ii;!. his d~fense,iyou contradicted your first sworn statement to the
Griev~nce Committee.
You; indicated in your second affidavit that the accused
attorney., "did not make a~y representations to m~ concerning the subordination
clause and I did not relY: upon any statements or representations of (him) in
reviewing and accepting the documents." You further stated that, "[I]n no
manner did (the accused attorney) fraudulently induce me to permit the
Purchase Money Deed of Tr~st to be recorded nor did he make any
representations whic~ induced me to permit the recording. I did not raise any
objection with (the accus¢d attorney) concerning any of the documents."

I

You concluded your s~cond affidavit by asserting that, "I am fully
sat:i,sfied that (the accused attorney) perpetrated no wr.ong on my clients in
the closing transaction and that he did not engage in any unethical or
improper conduct in his dealings with me in this matter."
Although you atte~pted to reconcile your inconsistent statements in
subsequent submissions to the Grievance COmiIlittee, their cont'radictory nature
is plain and unjustifiable. In the opinion of the Grievance Committee you
violated the letter and the spirit of Rules 1.2(c) and (d) of the Rules of
Professional Conduct whic~ prohibit misrepresentation by an attorney and
conduct that is prejudicai to the administration of justice. In the instant
case, it is clear that in at least one of your sworn statements, you
misrepresented the conduc,t of a fellow lawyer. You compounded this
regrettable lapse of professional responsibility by confusing the truth of the
matter so completely that the Grievance Committee was unable to determine with
confidence whether there was
merit to the underlying grievance.

It also appears that you violated N.C. Gen. Stat. §84-28(b)(3) by
knowingly misrepresenting the facts and circumstances surrounding the original
allegation of misconduct.
Investigations of attorney misconduct are not undertaken lightly by the
North Carolina State Bar. Since the professional reputation of an attorney is
invariably at stake when his conduct is called into question, the Grievance
Committee is obliged to .proceed with great care. It follows then that any
lawyer who volunteers or is called upon to assist the Committee by offering
information regarding possible professional misGonduct must also act with
great circumspection. It is obvious from your contradict'ory sworn stat~ments
that you failed to appreciate .the gravity of your actions and your
responsibility. Indeed, your cavalier disregard for the truth may have
subverted the disciplinary process in this instance.
The Grievance Committee realizes that your ,inconsistent statements may
well have been more the product of imprecise recollection and poor judgment
than an intent to deceive. For that reason, the Committee has not referred
the !!latter for disciplinarY prosecution. You should realize, however, that
any recurrence of this sort of conduct would be likely evoke a more severe
response. You are admonished to take greater care in the future to insure the
accuracy of your assertions, particularly in professional matters.
