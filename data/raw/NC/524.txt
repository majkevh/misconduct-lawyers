FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
forth herein.

The findings of fact in paragraphs I - 26 above are reincorporated as if set

2.
Defendant diverted funds that should have been available for minor
beneficiaries and other clients and converted them to his own use.
3.
Defendant misappropriated entrusted funds over the course of several
years to satisfy personal financial needs throughout that period of time.
4.
Defendant's misappropriatiou of the entrusted funds due to the minor
beneficiaries of the Sapps Estate and concomitant failure to comply with his obligation to
disburse the Sapps Estate funds to counsel for the conservator for the minor beneficiaries
necessitated appearance before Judge Dnndee W. Carter in Horry County, South
Carolina.
5.
At the meeting with the judge, Defendant had to admit he no longer had
the Sapps Estate funds to disburse. Accordingly, the judge was unable to compel the
disbursement of the Sapps Estate funds to counsel for the conservator that was warranted.

The North Carolina State Bar v. William I. Diggs, 16 DHC 15
Order of Discipline

Page 7 of12

6.
Defendant also no longer has the funds for the Tisdale minor that he
should have maintained.
7.
Defendant failed to participate in the profession's self-regnlation, by
failing to report his misappropriation to the North Carolina State Bar and failing to
respond to the letter of notice conceming his misappropriation.

8.
Defendant placed his own personal interests over those of his clients,
including the minors for whom he should have maintained entrusted funds.
9.
Defendant, by engaging in conduct involving misappropriation,
misrepresentation and deceit for a substantial period of time, has shown himself to be
untrustworthy.
10.
The perception of the profession in the eyes of clients and the public is
negatively affected by an attomey's misappropriation of entrusted funds belonging to
clients and to minors.

II.

Defendant has no prior record of disciplinary offenses.

12.
Defendant has been licensed since 1980. With his degree of experience,
Defendant should have known better than to engage in these acts that have led to the
discipline imposed in this order.

13.
The Hearing Panel finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence any
additional facts that may be contained in the conclusions regarding discipline set out
below.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional
Findings Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
The Hearing Panel carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it.
2.
The Hearing Panel considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.
Admin. Code § lB.01I4(w)(I), (2) and (3) and determined that the following factors are
applicable:
27 N.C. Admin. Code § IB.01I4(w)(l)

a. Factor (B), Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential
harm is foreseeable;

The North Carolina State Bar v. William I Diggs, 16 DHC 15
Order of Discipline

Page 8 of12

b. Factor (C), Circumstauces reflectiug Defendant's lack of honesty,
trustworthiness, or integrity;
c. Factor (D), Elevation of Defendant's own interest above those of his
clients;
d. Factor (E), Negative impact of Defendant's actions on client's or public's
perception of the profession;
e. Factor (1), Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication;
27 N.C. Admin. Code § lB.0I14(w)(2)
f.

Factor (A), Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication;

g. Factor (e), Misappropriation or conversion of assets of any kind to which
Defendant or recipient was not entitled, whether from a client or any other

source;
h. Factor (D), Commission of a felony;
27 N.C. Admin. Code § lB.01l4(w)(3)

i.

Factor (A), No prior record of disciplinary offenses;

j.

Factor (C), Dishonest or selfish motive;

Ie. Factor (F), A pattern of misconduct;

1. Factor (G), Ivluitipie offenses;
m. Factor (K), Absence of full and free disclosnre to the Hearing Panel;
n. Factor (R), Vulnerability of the victims; and
o. Factor (S), Substantial degree of experience in the practice of law.
3.
The factors present under 27 N.C. Admin. Code § IB.OI14(w)(I) and (2)
support imposition of disbarment in this case.
4.
Defendant caused significant harm to his clients and to minor beneficiaries
by misappropriating their entrusted funds.
5.
Proper maintenance and management of entrusted funds is a cornerstone
of the public's trust in the legal profession. Embezzlement is one of the most serious

The North Carolina State Bar v. William 1. Diggs, 16 DHC 15
Order of Discipline

Page 9 of12

offenses an attorney can commit, betraying the client's trust in the attorney and the
public's trust in the legal profession. Defendant's misappropriation caused harm to the
standing of the legal profession, undermining trust and confidence in lawyers and the
legal system.
6.
Defendant's repeated commission of criminal acts reflecting adversely on
his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer caused potential significant harm to the
legal profession, in that criminal conduct tends to bring the legal profession into
disrepute.
7.
Defendant's failure to respond to the letter of notice from the State Bar
and failure to participate in this disciplinary proceeding before the DHC results in
potential significant harm to the profession and to the public. The legal profession is
entrusted with the privilege of self-regulation. The State Bar can only regulate the
profession if its members respond to inquiries of the State Bar and otherwise participate.
Defendant's failure to respond to the State Bar and palticipate in this disciplinary
proceeding before the DHC shows an unacceptable disregard for the regulatory authority
of the State Bar. Defendant's failure to participate in the profession's self-regulation
impedes effective self-regulation and jeopardizes the privilege of the profession to remain
self-regulating.
8.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and finds that
suspension of Defendant's license or a public censure, reprimand, or admonition would
not be sufficient discipline because of the gravity of the actual and potential harm to his
clients, the public, the administration of justice, and the legal profession caused by
Defendant's conduct, and the threat of potential significant harm Defendant poses to the
public.
9.
The Hearing Panel considered all lesser sanctions and fmds that discipline
short of disbarment would not adequately protect the public for the following reasons:
a. Defendant repeatedly engaged in criminal acts reflecting adversely on his
honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer, and abused the trust placed
in him by his clients and as a fiduciary. Misappropriation of entrusted
funds is among the most serious miscondnct in which an attorney can
engage, and demonstrates the attorney is not tmstworthy;
b. Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Defendant cormnitted and
would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the
conduct expected of members of the Bar of this State; and
c. The protection of the public and the legal profession requires that
Defendant not be permitted to resume the practice of law until he
demonstrates the following: that he has reformed; that he understands his
The North Carolina State Bar v. William I. Diggs, 16 DHC 15
Order of Discipline

Page 10 of 12

obligations to his clients, the public, and the legal profession; and that
permitting him to practice law will not be detrimental to the public or the
integrity and standing of the legal profession or the administration of
justice. Disbarred lawyers are required to make such a showing before
they may resume practicing law.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and additional
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel hereby
enters the following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
I.

Defendant, William I. Diggs, is hereby DISBARRED from the practice of
