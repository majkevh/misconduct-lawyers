As Chairman of the Grievance Committee of the NQrth .Caroi~naS:tate Bar, it is now
my duty to issue this public censure and I am certain that you, u1,ld~rst;:anel fully: the
spirit in which this duty is performed, that you will urlderstand the censu~e,.an,a
appreciate its significance. The fact that a publ,ic ,ce1,lsure is not t,h~ Il1Cj,st,§j13r10us
discipline that may be imposed by the North Carolina State Bar should not be, taken by
you to indicate that any member of the Committee feeJ.s that yourc<;>nduct was'.excl,lsable
or less than a seriol.ls and substantiai violation of the Code o.f Profession;;tl
Responsibility.

$lO,230 in cash was sei.zed by the Robeson County Sheriff's I!epartm~nt l.lpon, the arrest.

of the charges. The money held by Ule Sheriff was to be re~ur:q.e9- to ~r. 'Maynp,r,exc~pt
for that portion claimed by the N. C. Department of Revenue and the :j:RS :for taxes and
the Sheriff for investigative costs. The Sheriff re.turn,ed $7,500 tQ' Mt. ~~aynon on
December 8, 1982. On December 17, 1984, you met with a represerltative of the N. C.
DepartJ;llent of Revenue and Mary Green of the Sheriff' ~ Depattmen,t to: apportion th~ ,
balance of the funds held on behalf of Mr. Maynor by the Sh~riff. ThePepa,rtment of
Revenue was paid $902.09 that day. The Sheriff's Department was :paid $15'0 from the
fund. ' The balance was delivered to you in cash that; day for you ,to deliver .to 1.our,

been filed against you concerning these funds by Mr. Maynor. Only then, in May, 1983,
did you finally deliver the balance of the funds to ~. May~or. Thus, held your
client's funds nearly five ful'l months and only after you had been adVised that a
grievance had been filed did y;ou deliver the funds. You have explained only that you
kept Mr. Maynor's cash in a safe in your office.

.

The Code of Professional Responsibility in North Carolina is very specific on your
obligations as an attorney in ithe handling of money on behalf of a client. You are
required as a condition precedent to the receipt of funds on behalf of a client to
maintain a trust banking accoupt in which only funds belonging to clients are
maintained. You are required ~o promptly notify the client of the receipt of any
funds, to maintain complete re~ords regarding those funds, and to promptly pay those
funds to the client. Disciplipary Rules 9-102(A) and (B). Your conduct Violated these
trust account rules. You did hot deposit the money in a trust account. You did not
advise your client of .its receipt. You did not deliver the funds to your client in a
timely manner and you did not ~aintain any records of its receipt or disbursement. It
was only in response to demands from the Grievance Committee that you prepared any
accounting of the funds to Mr. Maynor. The only redeeming feature of your conduct is
the fact that you did eventually deliver the funds to Mr. Maynor. The fact that you'
are no· longer engaged in the p:j:.".ivate practice of law mitigated the extent of the
diScipline.
I

Your conduct was unprofessional. It violated not only the letter of the Code of
Professional Responsbility but1also its spirit. Your conduct was not the conduct
expected of a member of the legal profession and an officer of the court. It brought
discredit upon you, the profession, and the courts. It damaged both your reputation
and the profesSion's. You placed your privilege to se.rve the public as a lawyer in
serious jeopardy. Finally, you violated one of the most sacred aspects of the
attorney-client relationship, the fact that an attorney sho1,lld always act as a
fiduciary with respect to client funds and insure the integrity of those funds always.

I',

The Committee is confident that this Public Censure will be heeded by you, that it
will be remembered by you, and will be beneficial to you. The Committee is confident
that you will never again allo~ yourself to depart from strict adherence to the highest
standards of the profession. Instead of being a burden, this Public Censure should
serve as a profitable and everipresent reminder to weigh carefully your
responsibilities to your clients, to the public, to your fellow attorneys, and to the
courts. It is hoped that the result will be that. you can once again be known as a
respected member of the profession whose word and conduct may be relied upon without
question.
Pursuant to Section 23 of I the Discipline and Disbarment Rules, it is ordered that
a certified copy of this Public Censure be forwarded t9 the Superior Court of Robeson
County for entry upon the judgffient docket and to the Supreme Court of North Carolina
for entry in it.s minutes. This, Public Censure will also be maintained as a permanent
record in the judgment book of the North Carolina State Bar. Pursuant to policy
adopted by the Council of the North Carolina State Bar on the taxing of costs in cases
where discipline is entered by the Grievance Committee, you are hereby taxed $50 as the '
administrative costs in this ac1tion.
