Based upon the pleadings and admissions pursuant to 27 N.C. Admin. Code
Chapter 1, Subchapter B, § .01l4(f) and Rule 8(d) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, the

FINDINGS OF FACT
1.
Plaintiff, the NOrtil Carolina State Bar ("State Bar"), is a body duly
organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring tins
proceeding under the autilOrity granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North
Carolina, and the Rules and Regulations of the NOrtil Carolina State Bar (Chapter 1 of
Title 27 of the North Carolina Administrative Code).
2.
Defendant, J. Scott Taggart (hereafter "Defendant" or "Taggart"), was
admitted to tile North Carolina State Bar in 1996 and is, and was at all times referred to
herein, an Attorney at Law licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the rules,
regulations, and Rules of Professional Conduct of the North Carolina State Bar and the
laws of tile State ofNortil Carolina.
3.

Defendant was properly served with process in this action.

4.
During all or part of the relevant periods referred to herein, Taggart was
engaged in the practice oflaw in the State of North Carolina and maintained a law office
in Greenville, Pitt County, North Carolina.
5.
In 2002, Taggart prepared a will for Pamela Ann Oriente which named
Taggart as executor and directed that her entire estate be given to various charities.
6.
Upon Oriente's death in 2004, Taggart filed her will in Pitt County
Superior Court. In October 2004, the Clerk of Superior Court issued Letters
Testamentary appointing Taggart executor of Oriente's estate.
7.
In March 2005, Taggart filed the Inventory for Oriente's estate. The only
estate property identified in the Inventory was approximately $171,000 in two bank
accounts.
8.
In January and again in February 2006, the Clerk issued a Notice to File to
Taggart, directing him to file the Final Accounting for Oriente's estate. The Clerk also
attempted to contact Taggart by phone.
9.
Taggart did not file any accountings showing receipts and disbursements
on behalf of the estate. After Taggart filed the Inventory, he did not respond to
subsequent communications from the Clerk about Oriente's estate.
10.
Because there were no further filings and Taggart had failed to respond to
communications from the Clerk, in March 2008 the Clerk entered an order categorizing
Oriente's estate as a closed file. However, The Bank of America account in the name of
The Estate of Pamela Ann Oriente ("the Oriente Estate account") remained under
Taggart's control as executor.
11.
In May 2008, Taggart disbursed $5,000.00 from the Oriente Estate
account to Greenville Community Shelter, one of the charities named in Oriente's will.
Taggart did not disburse any of the remaining assets of the estate to any of the other
beneficiaries nanled in Oriente's will.
12.
Over a three day period in May 2008, Taggart disbursed all of the
remaining funds in the Oriente Estate account to himself, his law firm, and one of his
companies. These disbursements totaled approximately $162,000.00.
13.
Taggart was not authorized to disburse the balance of the Oriente Estate
account to himself, his law firm, or his company.
14.
In April 2003, EZN Homes, Inc. ("EZN") entered into a contract with
Chase Manlmttan Mortgage Corp. ("Chase Manhattan") to purchase the property located
at 19203 Coachman's Trace, Comelius, North Carolina ("19203 Coachman's Trace").
The purchase price was $150,000.00.
15.
At the request of David Jolmson, a principal of EZN, Taggart obtained a
title insurance commitment for EZN's purchase of 19203 Coachman's Trace.

-2-

16.
Taggart's 16 Apri12003 preliminary opinion of title, which was provided
to Investors Title Insurance Company ("Investors Title") in order to obtain the title
insurance commitment, stated that EZN was the buyer, the purchase price was
$150,000.00, and the loan amount was $176,000.00.
17.
On 30 April 2003, Taggart sent an "Endorsement Request" to Investors
Title, requesting that the insurance policy be changed to reflect that the buyer was an
individual named John Walker, the purchase price was $240,000.00, and the loan amount
was $228,000.00.

Taggart prepared two different HUD-I Settlement Statements ("HUD-l s"): One was
provided to the seller, Chase Manhattan, and the other was provided to the lender,
Countrywide Home Loans ("Countrywide").

and bringing $16,878.38 in cash to closing. It also stated that the seller would receive
$221,881.89 in proceeds.

as the actual purchase price was $150,000.00 and the actual disbursement to Chase
Manhattan was $137,461.89.
23.
Taggart knew, at the time he prepared the HUD-I provided to
Countrywide in connection with Jolm Walker's purchase of 19203 Coaclunan's Trace,

Walkers") contacted Taggart about the 2003 real estate transactions in which the Walkers
had acquired 19203 and 19056 Coachman's Trace (collectively, "the Coachman's Trace
transactions").
44.
Counsel for the Walkers alleged that Taggart, as closing attorney for the
Coachman's Trace transactions, had acted improperly in connection with the transactions
and was civilly liable to the Walkers.
45.
The Walkers' attorney told Taggart that the Walkers sought $393,215.77
from Taggart, Taggart's law fIrm, and several other employees of the fIrm, as
compensation for damages they suffered in connection with the Coachman's Trace
transactions.

transactions (collectively "the defendants") entered into a settlement agreement with the
Walkers. The I July 2005 settlement agreement provided, in pertinent part, that:

Trace properties, in which they agreed to purchase the properties for a

civil actions, causes of action, claims, and demands of any kind ... arising
out of events connected to the [Coachman's Trace transactions]."

agreed to fulfill in part the obligations of the Settlement Agreement
undertalcen by the Executing Parties, specifically those obligations

§ 84-28(b)(3).

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the Hearing
Cornnlittee hereby finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the following
additional
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.
The findings in paragraphs 1 through 152 above are reincorporated as if
fully set forth herein.
2.
The falsely inflated purchase prices and seller proceeds shown on the
HUD-Is Taggart provided to Countrywide in connection with the Coachman's Trace
transactions were designed to mislead the lender about the value of the properties which
served as collateral for the mortgage loans.
3.
The individuals whose entrusted funds were in Taggart's firm's trust
account were, with respect to Taggart, either Taggart's clients or members of the public.

- 18 -

4.
Taggart engaged in conduct involving misrepresentation and deceit over a
period of at least five years.
5.
Clients are entitled to attorneys they can trust. Taggart, by engaging in
conduct involving misrepresentation and deceit over a substantial period of time, has
shown himself to be not trustworthy.
6.
Self-regulation of the legal profession relies upon the cooperation and
participation oflawyers in the self-regulatory process. When a lawyer refuses to respond
to a lawful inquiry from a disciplinary autllority, it undermines the system of selfregulation.
7.
The hearing committee has carefully considered all of the different forms
of discipline available to it in considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this
case.

Based upon tlle foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, and upon consideration of the factors set forth in
27 N.C. Admin. Code Chapter 1, Subchapter B, § .Ol14(w), the hearing committee
hereby enters the following additional
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1.

Taggart's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
a.

Dishonest or selfish motive, evidenced by Taggart's multiple
instances of dishonesty and use of entrusted funds for his own
benefit;

b.

A pattern of misconduct over a period of at least five years;

c.

Multiple offenses; and

d.

Substantial experience in the practice of law;

2.
There is no evidence or information before this committee which tends to
show any mitigating factors relevant to Taggart's misconduct.
3.
In cOlmection with the Coachman's Trace transactions, Taggart caused
significant potential harm to his client, Countrywide, by knowingly providing false
information designed to mislead tlle lender about the value of the properties which served
as collateral for the mortgage loans.
4.
Because the beneficial owners of the funds in Taggart's firm's trust
account were, with respect to Taggart, either Taggart's clients or members of the public,
Taggart caused significant harm or potential harm to his clients and/or the public by:

- 19-

a.
b.
c.

Embezzling $247,415.60 from his law firm's trust account to pay
the Walkers;
Embezzling $63,721.54 from his law firm's trust account to fund
EZN's purchase of the Belvin Ave property; and
Embezzling $96,998.72 from his law firm's trust account and
disbursing it to his company, Perpetual Properties.

5.
Taggart's embezzlement of approximately $162,000.00 from the Oriente
Estate also caused sigoificant actual harm to the public because those funds were
desigoated for the benefit of charitable organizations.
6.
Taggart's actions caused significant actual harm to the administration of
justice in that:
a.

b.

c.

Due to Taggart's inaction as executor of the Oriente Estate, the
Clerk of Court unnecessarily expended resources issuing Notices
to File and otherwise attempting to communicate with Taggart.
Taggart Imowingly notarized a total of four deeds of trust bearing
forged sigoatures and filed them in the Wake County Register of
Deeds, thereby causing false information to be placed in the public
record.
Taggart Imowingly notarized four deeds of trust bearing forged
sigoatures and filed them in the Johnston County Register of
Deeds, thereby causing false information to be placed in the public
record.

7.
Taggart's actions caused significant potential harm to the profession in
that his refusal to respond to lawful inquiries from the State Bar undermines the legal
profession's ability to self-regulate. Taggart's repeated commission of criminal acts
reflecting adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer also caused
sigoificant potential harm to the profession, in that criminal conduct by attorneys tends to
bring the legal profession into disrepute.
8.
The hearing committee has considered lesser alternatives and finds that
suspension of Taggart's license or a public censure, reprimand, or admonition would not
be sufficient discipline because of the gravity of the actual and potential harm to his
clients, the public, the administration of justice, and the legal profession caused by
Taggart's conduct, and the threat of significant potential harm Taggart poses to the
public.
9.
The hearing committee considered all lesser sanctions and finds that
discipline short of disbarment would not adequately protect the public for the following
reasons:
a.

Taggart committed misdeeds involving moral turpitude and
violations of the public trust, including fraudulent conduct,

- 20-

material misrepresentations, and deceit. Misconduct involving
misrepresentations and deceit are among the most serious that an
attorney can commit.
Such offenses demonstrate that the
offending attorney is not trustworthy. Clients are entitled to have
trustworthy attorneys;
b.

Taggart repeatedly engaged in criminal acts reflecting adversely on
his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer, and engaged in
abuses of trust by embezzling funds entrusted to his law firm and
to Taggart as executor of an estate.

c.

Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Taggart committed
and would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public
regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar of this
State.

d.

The protection of the public and the legal profession requires that
Taggart not be permitted to resume the practice of law until he
demonstrates the following: that he has reformed; that he
understands his obligations to his clients, the public, and the legal
profession; and that permitting him to practice law will not be
detrimental to the public or the integrity and standing of the legal
profession or the administration of justice. Disbarred lawyers are
required to make such a showing before they may resume
practicing law.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and additional
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the hearing committee
hereby enters the following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1.

Defendant, J. Scott Taggart, is hereby DISBARRED from the practice of

law.
