Mr. Cole to occupy the property and to attempt to
o b t a ~ n t i t I e by a d v e r s e po sse s s ion •
t-1 r. Col e wa,s
informed by Mr. Wells that he would deed the
property to him in his official capacity as
exscutor of the Campbell estate if Mr. Cole would
agree to pay the taxes on the property •

,

4.

Shortly thereafter, Mr. Cole visited the Jackson
County Courthouse for the purpose of obtaining tax
information and a legal description of the
property so that a de~d might be drafted which
would purport to convey the property from the
estate to Mr. Cole.

5.

While at the courthouse Mr. Cole was observed by
the Defendan~, ~ho was present on unrelated
busln;·ess.
There ensued' a conver sation between the
Defendant and Mr. Cole and his son, Richard cole,
relating to the real property in question.
It was
unclear from the evidence who initiated the
conversation and the Committee mak~s no findihg in
that regard.
.Based upon that conversation and a
further meeting between the Defendant and the
Coles later that afternoon, the Defendant came to
be~ieve that he had been employed to render
continuing legal assistance to Mr. Cole ralative
to his attempt to acquire the subject propert~ by
adve~se possession in return for which he would be
Fa~d a fee of 25~ of the value of the 'property,
dontingent, upon its ~cquisitiort by adverse
possession.

6.

Subsequently, tha Defendant perform~d various
legal services for Mr. Cole including counseling
him regarding t.he elements of adverse possession
and the advisability of selling timber on the
property, recording the deed to the property,
procuring a survey and making appropriate
responses to ~ossible encroachments of surveyor~
and n e i g h b 0 r s :.

7.

In Decembar, 1986, the Defendant, having become
aware that Mr. Cole had successfully prosecuted an
~ction to quiet title in his name with the
assistance of another attorney and had sold a
portion of the property for a considerable amount
of money, telepho.ned Mr. Cole and demanded payment
of $125,000 as his contingent fee.
At that time
Mr. Cole did not admit owing the Defendant
anything and referred the matter to his lawyer,
Clifton s. Fuller, Jr., of Lilburn, Georgia.
Mr.
Fuller then called the Defendant seeking
information concerning the Defendant's claim so
that he might advisa his client, Mr. c.ole •
