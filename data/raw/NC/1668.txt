This Censure is dedivered' to you pursuant t~ 'Sebtion23A(3)
of the Discipline and Disbarment,Ptocedures of tb~ North.Carolina state Bar as ordered by a hearing committee of the Dipciplina+,y
Hearing Commission fol;lowing a hearing in the above captioned ,
proceeding on January 10 and 11, 1992. At· that hearing" the
, hearing committee found that you had violated various provisions
of the Code, of, 'P.rofessiqnal Respon::;ib;i.lity of the, Nortll. :C~'1791ina
state Bar.. :,:"k
" '

'~-r - '

,
In 1982,' Lucy Shields, Wallace, Marie Shields Maness,Eula
Shields Phillips, Beatrice Shi~lds Hill, and Dorotlly Sl1ie'lds
Garner (hereinafter ,the ,Shields s~sters) hired you to represent
their mother, Aggie N~ncy K. Shields, in an action to'set aside a
deed, whe+,epy Aggie Shiel,ds conveyed prc;>Perty1;o th,ree of her
eight children, to the exclqsion o'f the five Shields $i,ste·:t'::;.
You filed' a complaint'in the action in Chatham 'CoUnty s~pjriot
Court.
'
'
The Shields sis~ers' paid you a total of $1,,200 as' the "
attorney's fee. Aggie Shields was unable to participate actively
in the trial of her Ca::;e due to, her failing health.,'
'
'. Consequently, you found it hecess~ry to cOnt:n\'\lnica1::ewi tli 'the, '
6hields sisters 'about the lawsuit~
On May 7, i984, 'the case of Aggie NancYM~ Shields V.' Wiliiam
Edger Shields et. ale (Shields case) was on the Chatham ¢quqty
Superior Court, calendar for trial.' All five Shields sisters
attended couit on that day.
,

'

For~er Superior"Court Judge james H. p'ou ea:i,.ley dism:i,.$sed tJ~e

Shields case because you failed to file a pretrial o:t;der, as,
ordered on three occasions by Superior Court Judge, Gordon Battle.
Judge Bailey entered an order to that affect on Mq:y,7, 19a4.
You told the Shields sisters that Judge Bailey ,dismissed
their mother's lawsuit. However, you did not tell the~ the" ,
~eason for the dismissal of' the la~suit.
Yoq failed t~info~m
the Shields ',sipters that Judge Bailey dismissed the lawsuit
,because'you did not comply with three prior court orders' to file
a pretrial order in the Shields case.

Your c6nduct,T"iolated several prOVl.Sl.ons of the Code of
Professional Responsibility of the North Carolina state Bar which
. was in effect until Octobe~ 7~ 1985. By not filing a pretrial
order in the Shields case as ordered by a superior court judge,
you allowed the ca$e to be dismissed and thus neglected a mattei
entrusted to you ih violation of Disciplinary Rule 6 .... 101 (A) (3).
Your failure to file the pr~trial order was prejudicial to the
administration of j.ustice in violation of Disciplinary Rule
.
1-102 (A) (5). Furthermore, by not informing the Shields sisters
of the basis for the dismissal of the lawsuit, in particular by
not explaining tha. t· the reason. for the dismissal was due to your
non-compliance of court orders, you neglected a legal matter
.
. entrusted to you and ~ngaged in professional conduct that is
. prejudicial to the: administration of justice in 'violation of
Disciplinary Rule 6-1.01 (A) (3) and 1-102(A) (5), ·r~spectively.

I
;

The hearing committee was concerned about the way you handled
the appeal of the-Shields case to the North Carolina Court of
. Appeals.
By your pwn admission, you sought to collect· a $5,000
attorney's fee for:an appeal which·laQked subst~nti~l merit ahd
for the appeal of ?t matter was due to your own neglect and
.failure to comply with court orders. Furthermore; you admitted
that a settlement was· reached by the Shields sisters and their
brothers with resp~ct to two-thirds of. the disputed property.
Therefore, pursuing an appeal of the remaining disputed property
,was not· advantageous to the Shields sisters, but· would have
resulted in a $5,000 fee for you.
Although the hearing committee has chosen·to impose a
relatively moderate sanction of a censUre, yo~ should not assume
that the Disciplinary Hearing Commission in any.way feels that
your. conduQt in th~s ,matter was excusable~ The hearing committee
trusts that youwi~l 90nsiqer this censure, recognize the errors
that you have made, and never again allow yoursel·f· to depart from
adherence to the high ethical standards of the legal profession.
This censure should serve as a strong rem~nder and indUcement for
you to weigh carefUlly in the future your responsibility to the
public, your Clients, your fellow attorneys, and·the courts to
the end that you demean yourself as a respected member of the
. legal profession who$e conduct may be relied upon without
question.
