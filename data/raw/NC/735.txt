and has refused to give any explanation for his conduct.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, and upon the evidence and arguments presented at
the heming concerning appropriate discipline, the I-leming Panel hereby enters the
following
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fornls of
discipline available to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB ยง .OI14(w)(I) of the Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and concludes the following suspension and disbarment factors are
applicable in this matter:
a.

intent of the defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential harm is
foreseeable;

b.

elevation ofthe defendant's own interest above that of the client;

c.

negative impact of defendant's actions on client's or public's perception of
the profession;

d.

negative impact of the defendant's action on the administration of justice;

e.

impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the
representation;

f

eflect of defendant's conduct on third parties;

g.

acts of dishonestly, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication; and

h.

multiple instances of failure to participate in the legal profession's selfregulation process.

')
The Heming Panel has also considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. IB ยง .OI14(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar
and concludes the following factors disbarment factors are applicable in this matter:
a.

acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication; and

b.

misappropriation or conversion of assets to which the Defendant was not
entitled.

6

3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. lB ยง .OI14(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar
and concludes the following general factors are applicable in this matter:
a.
prior disciplinary offenses in this state or any other jurisdiction, or the
abscnce thereof;
b.

dishonest or selfish motive;

c.

indifference to making restitution;

d.

multiple offenses;

e.

bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceedings by intentionally
failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency;

f.

submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices
during the disciplinary process;

g.

vulnerability of victim; and

h.

degree of experience in the practice oflaw.

4.
The I-Iearing Panel has considered all lesser forms of sanctions available to
it and finds that disbarment is the only appropriate discipline in this case, for the
following reasons:
a.

Defendant committed misconduct involving misappropriation and deceit.
Misconduct involving misappropriation and deceit is among the most
serious that an attorney can commit. Such misconduct demonstrates that
the offending attorney is not trustworthy. The public is entitled to have
trustworthy attorneys and should be able to assume that all lawyers are
trustworthy;

b.

Defendant has not participated in this disciplinary action and has been
previously disciplined for failure to pmยทticipate in the disciplinary process.
Self regulation of the legal profession requires that members of the
profession participate in the grievmlce and disciplinary processes of the
North Carolina State Bar;

c.

Entry of an order imposing lesser discipline than disbarment would fail to
aclmowledge the seriousness of the offenses committed by Defendant ,
would be inconsistent with discipline issued in other cases involving
similar misconduct, and would send the wrong message to attorneys and
the public regarding the conduct expected of members of the N0l1h
Carolina State Bar; and

7

d.

The protection of the public and the legal profession requires that
Defendant not be permitted to resume the practice of law until he
demonstrates the following: that he has reformed; that he understands his
obligations to his clients, the public, and the legal profession; and that
permitting him to practice law will not be detrimental to the public or the
integrity and standing of the legal profession or the administration of
justice. Disbannent requires an attorney to make such a showing before
he or she may be reinstated.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Findings of
Fact Regarding Discipline, and Conclusions Regarding Discipline, the I-Iearing Panel
hereby enters the following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
I.
Defendant, W. Ray Hudson, is hereby DISBARRED from the practice of
law in North Carolina.
