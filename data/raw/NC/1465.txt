At its regular quart~rly meeting on April 16, 198q, the Grievance

stateme,nt,to theCommitte¢. Pursuant to Section 13(10) of the Discipline <;lnd
Disbarment Rules, the Cominittee found probable cause. Probable cause is
defined under the Discipl~ne an4 Disbarment R~les as: i'A finding by the

r

On July 23, 1986, th~ staff c.ounsel requested the Committee to reconsider
the grievance filed again~t you. After some consideration~ the Committee
v.oted to rescind the prior direction of filing a complaint before the
DiSciplinary Hearing Comm~ssion. The Committee determined that a complaint
and ·a hearing were not warranted and the Commit~ee issued a Public Censure
upon your acceptance or i~. Therefore, the Committee issues this Public
Censure to you.

As Chairman of the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar,
it is now my duty to issue this Pu,!:>lic Censure aI),d I am certain that you
u,nders.tand fully the spi·r~t in wpich this duty is pe·rformed, -that yo1,1 will
1.mderstan4 the censure,a-p.d appreciate its significance. The fact that a
public censure is not the. most serious discipline that may be imposed by the
North Carolina State Bar should not be taken by you to indicate that any
member of the ComIilittee f~e1s that your conduct was excusable or less than a
serious and substantial v~olation of the Code of Professional Responsibility.
You represented Mr. Ibrahim Saadeh in several business and real est'<lte
transactions. In one of phose matter~, Mr. Sa'adeh requested that you obtain a
judgment against a party for: (1) certain u~paid contract payments due on a
real estate sale alid (2) 9,amages to a buiid:f,ng rapossessed by Mr. Saadeh.
According to your respons~ toa Letter of Notice issued to you, you advised
Mr. Saadeh of the unlikelihood of recovering any ad4itional sums from the
party. However, you agre~d to accept the case. You admitted that "the matter

Your client, Mr. Saadeh, sued another party ina summaryejec·tmeilt
action. You represented Mr. Saadeh in smaii claims court regarding this
action. The magistrate ruled in favor of the opposing party~n4 granted her' a
$1,000 judgment in her counterclaim against Mr. Saadeh.

The magistrate's decision was app~aled to district cour.t fot' tr;l.a;l; de.

The opposing party requested and receiv¢d a defaul:t 'j;udgment ,for YO,tit·
failure to reply. Therefore, the magiStrate's judgment was aUbmeqc. 'fit.,
Sa?-deh was forced to pay the $1,000 jud~ment, without having an OPpo~tlln~t'y ,to
be heard in court on appeal.
In the North Carolina Code of Professional, Responsibility, an attor,ney :J.;s
advised about his obligations in handlin,ghis client's legal matters.
Disciplinary Rule 6-101(A)(3) states that a l,awyer shall not negle~~ a leg~l
matter entrusted to him. In addition, Canon 7 charges anattorn~y witlttlle
duty of representing h:f,s client zealously within the bounds of the
Disciplinary Rule 7-101 (A) (1) (2) provides that:

,
reasonably available means permitted by law and the Discipi;l.nary, '
,Rules, except as provided by DR7~lbl(B). A lawyer do~s not vio:l.ate
this Disciplinary Rule, however, by acceding to reasona'Qle r~qllests
of oppos:J.;ng counsel which do ~ot prej',\lc;iice the rights Of hiS c1i~tit,
by being punctual in fulfilling all professionai commitments, by .
avoiding offensive tactics, or by treating with courtesy and
consideration all persons involved in the legal process.

under DR1-110, DRS-102, and DRS-lOS!

failed to seek his lawful objectives in, tlwse actions. In addition, in,tbe

Finally, you procured a $600 judgment 'for Mr. Saadeh in a civil action.
You stated that you received the money for Mr. Saadeh and turned it over to
him. However, you cannot locate any records showing the release of thQse
funds. Granted, Hr. Saadeh was not sur~that h~ received the money! But., you
could not produce any records to account for your client's funds.

When an attorney is entrusted with his client '.5 funds, the attorney has a
duty to maintain complete: records of all funds of the client. The attorney
must also render appropri~te accounts of the funds to his clients. In this
case, the uncertainty regarding the receipt of those funds could have been
eliminated if you had mai~tained proper and complete records of all client's
funds and properties.
