AFFIDAVIT

TO:

The Council of The North Carolina State Bar

I,
Robert R. Hyde
, hereby tender my lil'~nse to practice
and desire to resign from The North Carolina State Bar. My resignation is tendered freely and
voluntarily, is not the result of coercion or duress, and I am fully aware of the implications of
submitting the resignation.

I am aware that there are presently pending investigations or other proceedings regarding
allegations that I have been guilty of misconduct, to wit:
misappropriation of client funds.
Full restitution has been made regarding the funds involved.

I acknowledge that the material facts upon which the complaints are predicated are true. I
am submitting my resignation because I know that if charges were predicated upon the misconduct
under investigation I could not successfully defend against them.
