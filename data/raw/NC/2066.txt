3. The order of the Colorado Supreme Court found that Campbell filed a civil action
against a chiropractor in retaliation, after the chiropractor flied a grievance against
Campbell with the Texas State Bar, which constitutes conduct in violation of Rule
1.2(d) of the North Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct and which justifies the
imposition of reciprocal discipline in this state.
4. The censure imposed by the Colorado Supreme Court should be imposed on Campbell's
right to practiFe law in the State of North Carolina.

I

THEREFORE IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:
1. Austin Campbell is hereby censured.
2. Campbell is hereby taxed with the costs of this proceeding as assessed by the Secretary.
