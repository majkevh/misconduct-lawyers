REPRiMAND

On January 20,2005 the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina State Bar met and
considered the grievances filed against you by the Nortp Carolina State Bar.
Pursuant to 'Section :Ol13(a) of the Discipline and Disability Rules of the North Carolina
State Bar, the Grievance Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the
information available to it, including your respOl1S~ to the letter. of notice, the Grievance
Committee found probable cause. Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable cause to
believe that a member of the North Carolina State Bar is guilty of misconduct justifying
disciplinary action."

The rules provide that after a finding of probable cal,lse, the Grie:vance Committeehlay
determine tha~ the filing of a complaint and a hearing before the Disciplil1ary Hearing
Commission are not required, and the Grievance Committee may issue various levels of
discipline depending upon the misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any
aggravating or mitigating factors. The Grievance Committee may issue an admonition, a
reprimand, or a censure to the respondent attorney.
A reprimand is a Written form of discipline more serious than an admonition issued in
cases in which an attorney has violated one or more provisions of the Rules of Professional
Conduct and has caused hafm or potential harm to a client, the administration of justice, the
profession, or a member of the public, but the misconduct does not require a censure.
The Grievance Committee was of the opinion that a censure isÂ·not req\lired in this case
and issu~s this reprimand to you. As chairman of the Grievance Committee of the NQrth
Carolina State Bar, it is now my duty to issue this reprimand, and I am certain that you will .
unqerstand fuIiy the spirit in whlch this duty is performed.
