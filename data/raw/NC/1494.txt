Defendant failed to appear as d~rected by the

Defendant, direct~d no communication to the North
Carolina State B~r and produced no documents.
BASED UPON the foregoing FINDINGS OF FACT, the
committee makes the fol~owing CONCLUSIOMS OF LAW:

he~ting

I

(1)
The conduct of the defend~nt constitutes grounds for
diacipline pursuant to N.C. Gen~ Stat. §84-28(b)(2) in that:
"(a)

By failing to take the necessary steps to
perfect Mosely's .ppeal, defendant failed to
act w~th reasonable di~igence and promptness
in repfesentin~ his_ client in violati~n of
lule 6(B),(3) [for th~ period prior to Octob.r
7, 1985, defandant neglected a legal matt~r
entruseed to him in violation of
DR6-101(A)(~)]; int~ntionally failed to seek
the law flll 0 b j ec t i v'e s 0 f his c 1 i e n t t h r 0 ugh
reasonably available means permitted by law
if. n vi () 1 a t i,on o·f It,u 1 e 7. 1( A ) (1) ,[ p rio r t ()
October 7, 1·985 defendant's cOhduct violated
DR 7 - ~ 0-1 (A ) (1 ) 1; p re j u d ice d 0 r ·d a mag e d his
client during the course of the professional
telationship in violation of Rule 7.1(A)(3)
[p~ior to October 7, 19fi5 defendant's conduct
violated DR7·161(A)(~).

(b)

By telling M0 's ely's fat h e'ra nd ';-,,6 i s t e r that'
Mosely's appeal Was pr~ca~d~ng as necesBary
to bring it to a cDnclusion while knowing
that he had failed to perfec~ M6sely's
appeal, defendant knowingly made a false
stat.mant of law or fact in violation of Rule
7.2(A)(4) and engaged in conduct involVing
dishGn~sty, fraud, deceit, or
misreptes~ntation in violation of aule
L2(C).

(-c)

By falling t·o inform Mo.se1y of the Nort,h
Carolina Court of Appeals decision- to dismis,s
Mosely's .ppea1 without prejudice to Mosely
fo petition for a writ of certiorari,
defendant failed to keep the client
reasonably infDrmed about the status of a
matter in violation of Rule 6eB)(1) and
fai1.d to explain a matter to the extent
re'asona:'bly necessary to permit the client to
make informed d~cisions regarding the
representation in violation of Rule 6(B)(2).

(d)

By fai1~ng to take any action to pursue a
writ of certiorari on Mosely's behalf or take
any action to ensure that Mosely OT someone
