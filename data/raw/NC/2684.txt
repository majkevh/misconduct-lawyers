Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Additional Findings of Fact
Regarding Discipline, and the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel enters the following:

CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
1B ยง .OI14(w)(l) ofthe Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and concludes the
following factors are present:
a.

Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential harm is
foreseeable;

b.

Elevation of the Defendant's own interest above that of his client;

c.

Negative impact of Defendant's actions on client's or public's perception of
the profession;

d.

Negative impact of the Defendant's actions on the administration of justice;

e.

Impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the representation;
and

f.

Multiple instances of failure to participate in the legal profession's selfregulation process.

2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
1B ยง .OI14(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar and concludes
that none of those factors are present.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C.
IB ยง .OI14(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the NOlth Carolina State Bar and concludes the
following factors are applicable in this matter:
a.

Prior disciplinary offenses in this State;

b.

Selfish motive;

c.

A pattern of misconduct;

d.

Multiple offenses;

e.

Effect of personal or emotional problems on the conduct in question;

7

f.

Effect of physical or mental disability or impairment on tbe conduct in
question;

g.

Vulnerability of victims; and

h.

Defendant's experience in the practice of law.

4.
Defendant's conduct in this proceeding and his prior discipline is remarkable for
neglect of client's cases and Defendant's repeated failure to participate in the self-regulatory
processes oflhe profession.

5.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fOlIDS of discipline
available, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and disbarment, in considering
the appropriate discipline to impose in this case. The Hearing Panel concludes that any
discipline less than suspension would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the violations
committed by Defendant and send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the
conduct expected of members of the Bar in this State.
6.
The Hearing Panel has considered all alternatives and concludes that a suspension
is necessary to adequately protect the public. The Hearing Panel finds that an order imposing
discipline short of suspension would not be appropriate.

Additional Findings of Fact and Conclusions Regarding Discipline, and with the consent of the
