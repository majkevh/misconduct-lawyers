ordered Mr. Reynolds to provide proof of compliance with these termS to the State Bar by
March 28, 2003.
2.

Sandie Chappell, Deputy Clerk ofSuperiorCQurt, Guilford County,

mailed a copy ofthe Court's December 27, ;2002, order to Mr. Reynolds on December
30,2002.

3.

Mr; Reynolds did not obtain a mental health evaluation by March 10,

4.

Mr. Reynolds did not provide proofofCOn1pli~rtce with this Court's ord~r

200:3.

to the State Bar by March 28, 2003.
5.

Mr. Reynolds did not obtain the approval of the State Bar fc;>r any mental

health provider to perform the mental h~alth evaluation.
6.

Mr. Reyrtolds did 'obtain a mental health evaluation, which lists the dates

of assessment as July 17,2003, and August 15,2003, from Thomas Hedding, whose
evaluation of Mr. Reynolds indicates he is a licensed psychologist.

7.

Mr. Reynolds did not provide a copy of this evaluation to the State Bar,

8.

Carolin Bakewell, Counsel for the State Bar, contacted. Mr. Richard Tate,

Mr. Reynolds' attorney, regarding Mr. Reynolds' compliance with this Court's order.
Ms. Bakewell received no response,
Neither Mr. Reynolds nor Mr'. Tate contacted the State Bar before the'

I

deadlines set by the Court to discuss any problems complying with the Court) order or to
discuss obtaining an extension of time to comply with the Court's order.
10.

Mr. Reynoldf:i knew ofthis Court's Decembet 21, 200Z, Order and

willfully failed to comply with its terms.
Mr. Reync;>lds; failure to comply with this Court's order is not an isolated

11.

incident. Mr. R.eynolds has' failed to comply with numerous orders ofthe United States
District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, as described in that Court's·
September 9, 2003, Me11ior~dum Order Staying Cases, filed in case number 1:03 MC
0089.

Mr. Reynolds' violations of orders ofthe United Statesbistrict Court for

12.

the Middle District of North Carolina, includfng discovery orders atid scheduling orders,

have negatively impacted his clients and led that Court to stay Mr. Reynolds; pending
cases in that Court to prevent any further harm while Mr. Reynolds' conduct is
investiga~ed.

One of the reasons Mr. Reynolds was originally disciplined by this Court

.was because he did not undertake the work necessary to petfect an appeal, inaction that
negatively impacted a client.
13.0ne ofthe reasons Mr. Reynolds was originally disciplined. by the Court
I

was becadse he made a false statement to the Court., During his testimony and argument
at the hearing Oil November 24, Mr. Reynolds made at least one statement to the Court
that was hot true. Specifically, Mr. Reynolds stated that "nobody has ~every questioned

I

my honesty and integrity," yet in the'Order entered in 1:03 MC 0089, a United States
District Gourt Judge specifically exptessed "concerns about Mr. Reynolds' ability or
willinges$ ... to be candid. with the Court," and anyone reading that Order would
conclude that it raised very substantial questions about Mr. Reynolds' honesty. Two
other statements made during the heating either were not true or if they were true, show
disregard for his professional and ethical obligations. Specifical1y, Mr. Reynolds testined
that he h~d not seen the written report by psychologist Thomas Hedding before the
I

Novemb~r

24 hearing; during ctoss-ex,amination, however, he admitted that he had the

report in:his possession several t;llonths ago and petsollallydelivered the report to the
Clerk of the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. Mr.

Reynold~ testified that he did not read the report at that time. If Mr. Reynolds in fact did
not read the report, this shows a further disregard for the Court's orders, which
specifically required that Mr. Reynolds comply with any treatment re~ommendations
made in ~he evaluation. If Mr. Reynolds did read the report, which seems more likely,
then he 'fas once again dishonest with the Court. Further, Mr. Reynolds testified that his
client in the First National Pawn lawsuit directed him to dismiss the appeal in that case.
If this is ~rue, then Mr. Reynolds violated numerous rules oJprofessional conduct by

arguing to the Court in violation oihis client's instructions that the appeal should. not be
dismissed.. Ifit is not true, which seems more likely,. then Mr. Reynolds has again been
dishonest with the Court.
14. ". At the November 24 hearing, Mr. Reynolds made numeroUs contradictory
statements about whether he had ot had not received copies of certain documents,

3

, ':'

"

":

I

whether he did or did not. have notice of hearings, whether his client lived in county or
out of state, and his correct mailing address. His ability to be honest with the Court is
still under question.
15.

Mr. Reynolds' attitude at the November 24 cali. best be characterized as

deliberately dense. He seems l..!11willing to understand the magnitude ofthe problem he is
facing in this Court or in the United States District Court and disinclined to concern

I

~elf with requirements

of which -he does not approve,. even when they are in court

orders. This disconnect from reality about his own legal situ~tion is particularly
disturbing when one realizes that Mr. Reynolds is presently providing legal advice to .
laypeople who are highly likely to rely on his judgment and evaluation of their legal
problems.
16.

The mental health evaluation Mr. Reynolds underwent raises as niaily

questions as it answers, Mr. Reynolds did not disclose to the psychologist the extent of'
his problems With the coutts and he was otherwise not forthcoming with the psychologist.
Mr. Reynolds' testimony and argument at the November 24 hearing, while not
completely incoherent, was confused and confusing and did not give rise to an>,
confidence that Mr. Reynolds d<?es not have mental health problems or issues.
17.

Mr, Reynolds has not accepted respohsibility for this violatioh, has

engaged in a pattern of violating court orders, and has given no reliable assurance that he

will not violate art order ofthe Court again.

I

.Based on these findings offact, the Court CONCLUDES as a matter oflawthat:
1.

In evaluating the evidence and imposing the requirements made herein,

the Court is acting pqrsuant to its inherent allthority and duty to disciplme attor.p.eys, to'
protect itself from impropriety, to protect the public, and to .safeguard the administration
of justice. See, e.g., ln re Hunoval, 294 N.C. 740, 744 (1971); State v. Spivey, 213 N.C.
45 (1938); InrePaul, 84 N.C. App. 491,499-500, cert. denied,-319N;C. 673 (1987), cert.
denied, 484 U.S~ 1004 (1988). The Court's inherent power is not litnited or bound-by the'
t~chnical precepts contained in the Rules of Professional Conduct. Swenson v. Thibaut,
.
.
.

39 N.C. App: 77, 109 (1978), cert. denied and app~al dismissed, 296 N.C. 740 (1979).

The Court also acts pursuant to its authority to address indirect criminal

contempt of court, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 5A-ll and 5A-13; after having held this
plenary hearing for criminal contempt pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 5A-I5.
~.

Mr. Reynolds's violation of this CoUrt's December 27,2002, order Was

done knpwingly, and willfully.
Mr~ Reynolds' disregard of this Court's order harms the administration of

4.

justice by impairing this Cotirt's ability to address Mr. Reynolds' behavior before it; and

by generally impairing this Court's ability to regulate attorneys who appear before it.

~

I

Mr. Reynolds' violation ofthis Court's order is part of a broader. pattern of

~.
,

violating orders of the courts, some of which haye l1egatively impacted clients. Mr;
Reynolds' violation of this Court's order causes concern for the protection of the public.
The Court has evaluated other and lesser sanctions arid/or disciplinary

6.

measures in light of all the evidence and finds in its discretion that lesser disciplinary
measures would not be appropriate. Specifically, the Court has considered suspending
Mr. Reynolds' license and staying that suspension upon appropriate terms and conditions.
Given Mr. Reynolds' behavior oVer the last.yeat, the Court has no confidence that MJ:.
Reynolds wouid comply with the terms and conditions the Court would impose, which
failure would require further action before the Court. the Court has deterrtrlned therefore
that it is appropriate to place the burden on Mr. Reynolds to seek a stay, ifhe is so
inClined and willing to comply with appropriate terms and conditions.

It is thereforeORDERBD that:

1.

Mark Floyd Reynolds, II is hereby suspended from the 'practice of law for two

years, effective 60' days from the date this Order is mailed to him by the Clerk. He shall
comply With any Written directives ofthe North Catolina State Bar ~oncerning wrapping
I

up his pr&ctice during the course of the next 60 days. He shall take all necessary steps to
promptly withdraw from all pending cases. This obligation is personal to Mark Floyd
ReynoldstII and cannot be delegated to any other person, including any lawyer Mr.
Reynolds,might hire.
