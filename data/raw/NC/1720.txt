. On April 15, 1993, the Grievance Committee of the North
Carolina St~te Bar met and considered the grievance filed against
you by Cons'1;:ance 'i .. Pascoe.
Pursu~I).t to section 13{A) of article IX of the Rules and
RegUlations of the North Carolina state Bar, the Grievance
Committee conducted a preliminary nearing. After considering the
information available to it, including your response to the
letter of notice, the Grievance' Committee found probable cause.
Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable cause. t·o
believe that a member of the North Carolina State Bar is guilty
of misconduct justifying disciplinary action. Ii

'

The rules provide that after a finding of probable cause,
the Grievance Committee may determine that the filing of a
complaint and a 'hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing
Commission are not required and the Grievance Committee may issue
various lev~ls of discipline depending upon the misconduct, the
actual or potential injury cauSed, and any aggravating or
mitigating factors.

admonition,reprimand, or a censure.

A censure is a.written form of discipline more serious than·
a reprimand, issued in cases in which an attorney has violated
one or more ~rovisions of the Rules o£ Professional . Conduct and
has caused ~;ignificant harm or potential signf£icant harm to a
client, the ,administration of justice, the profession or a ~ember
of the public, but the misconduct does not require suspension of
the attorney's license.
The Gri:evance Committee believes that a hearing before the
Disciplinary Hearing Commission is not required in this case and
issues this :censure to you. AS Chairman of the Grievance
. Committee. o'f, the North Carolina state Bar, it.is now my duty to
issue this censure.' I am certain that you will understand fully
the spirit in which this duty is performed.
.

automObile a'ccident on June 6, 1990 in Ri.chmond, VA and that
shortly thereafter She hired yOU to represent her with a personal
injury claim,. Thro\lghout your representation of . complainant , you
