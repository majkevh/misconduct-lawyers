a .lawyer, ¥ou must. not fo:rget your
professJ.onal oblJ.gatJ.on to hal;d!-e prarrptly ¥our clJ.ent's affairs. Although
you had delegated the responsibJ.ty of ha.rrlll.I'lg the Bullru;d estate to a
.
paralegal, cannon..3 of ~e Rules of Pro~essional COnduct provides that you, as
the lawyer, are respc;>nsible for your clJ.ent' s case - not the paralegal.

On AU9llSt 13, 1990, carol Osen filed a grievc;mce against you relative to
your handlmg of the Bullard estate. Ms. Osen raJ.Sed the same concerns as Ms •
. ~ley and further complained that you had filed a final accounting in the
. BI;lllard estate qn Sep~ ?6, ,1990 ( rep~ting that $34,204 .10 ~d been
disburSed. to several benefJ.cJ.arJ.es, 1.ilclucli.rxJ the Clenrrnons PresbyterJ.an Olurch
o~· which Ms. Osen is an elSler. At the time that Ms. Osen filed her grievance
wJ.tp tl).e state Bar, youstJ.ll had not closed the. estate. Also, there was a
concern about the beneficiares not .receiving the money indicated on the final
accounting. You explained that you asked the clerk of superior court to check
~ aI?l?rove the final accounting. and you were wai~ing to hear from the clerk .
regardllig her approval prior to disbursing the checks.' '!his series of events
.caused great concern to. the beneficiaries of the estate and the state Bar •

. The Grievance Comm.;i.ttee was concerned about your handling of the appeal
<;>f <;harles Bennet~..
FrOm ¥our response to the Grievance Con1I1Uttee~ you
indJ.cate that Mr. Bennett dl.d not pay the necessary cost for the trJ.al
transcript. You state,that you contacted Mr. Bennett's wife and told her of
their 'heed to pay the appeal cost before yoti could proceed. In a ietter dated
November 29, 1989, you restated the need for the $1,500 to deposit with the
courtreJ?Orter for· the preparation. of the traJ:tscript. Ha.yever, at the time you
sent thJ.s letter of November 29, 1989, the tJ.me for 5el:Vl.I'lg the proposed
record. on appeal had expired. You had not obtained an extension of time to
prepare and. sel:Ve the ptoposed record. on appeal.
.
. ' Yeti later sought to withdraw as the attorne¥ for Mr. Bennett on his·
.
appeal. . However, Judge JoseI?h R. John, Sr., denl.ed your request because there
, were only a few weeks remainmg to perfect Mr. Bennett's appeal. Judge John
indicated'that to allow you to withdraw at. that time would be Unfair to Mr.
, Bennett and. to any subsequent cotl.l1Sel appointed to represent Oim.
You did not attend promptly and diligently to perfecting Mr. Bennett's
appeal i It appears that you shoUld have made an earlier detennination that
Mr. Bennett was in need of other. counsel since he could not pay your, fee and
the appeal costs. yotI.r, delay in ~ that decision' j ebpardized M r . .
'
Bennett's appeal rights. Again, the Committee is aware that you experienced
some personal problemS ,durin:j the time you were handling this appeal.
However; a lawyer must not forget his professional obligation to represent his
client in a competent and prompt mmner. Your conduct relative to handling
Mr •. BEmpett's appeal did not comply with Rule 6(B) (3) and Rule 7.1(A) (1), (2)
, and. (3) of the Rules of Professional COnduct.

ponder this Public Repri.m9.nd, recognize the error that you have made, and ,that
you will never again alloW yourself to depart from adherence to the high

as a strong reminder and inducement for you to weigh car'?fully in the future
your responsibility to the public, your clients, your fellow attorneys and the
courts to the end that you demean yourself as a respected member of the legal
profession whose condu¢t may be relied upon without question.
