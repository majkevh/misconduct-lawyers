REPRIMAND

I

On Aprii 16, 1992, the Grievance Committee of the North Carolina
state Bar met and considered the grievance filed against you by
Hulon McCraw.
Pursuant to section 13 (A-) of article IX of the Rules and
Regulations of the North Carolina state Bar, the Grievance
Committee conducted a preliminary hearing. After considering the
information available to it, including your response to the
letter of notice, the Grievance Committee found probable cause.
Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable cause to
believe that a memb~r of the North Carolina state Bar is guilty
of misconduct justifying disciplinary action."
The rules provide that after a finding of probable cause, the
Grievance comm,ittee·may d.etermine that the filing of a complaint
and a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing Commission are not
required and the Grievance Committee may issue various levels of
discipline depending upon the miscondUct, the actual or potential
injury Caused, and any .aggravating or mitigating factors. The
Grievance Committee may issue an admonition, reprimand, or
censure to the respondent attorney.
A reprimand is a written form of discipline more serious than an
admonition issued in cases in which an attorney has violated one
or more provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct and has
caused harm or potential harm to a client, the administr~tion of
justice, the profession, or a member of the public, but the
miscondUct does not require a cenSUre.
The GrieVance Committee was of tbe opinio~ that a censure is not
required in this Caise and i$sues this r~primand to you. As
chairman of the Grievance Co:mntittee of the North Carolina state
Bar, it is now my duty to issue this reprimand and I am certain
that you will Understand fully the spirit in which this duty is
performed.
The Grievance Committee found that you made the following
comments during the guilty plea proceeding of The state of North
Carolina v. Melvin,Philiip McCraw on June 10, 1991:
