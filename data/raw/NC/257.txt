TO:

The Council of the North Carolina State Bar

I, William 1. Bair, hereby tender my license to practice and desire to resign from the North Carolina
State Bar. My resignation is extended freely and voluntarily, and is not the result of coercion or duress, and I
am fully aware of the implications of submitting this, my resignation.
I am aware that there is presently pending an investigation or other proceedings regarding allegations
that I have been guilty of misconduct, specifically that:

1.	 Between May and October 1996, I misappropriated for my own use and benefit $22,552.60 of funds
I was holding in my trust account for my client, Wingate T. Jones.
2.	 After the allegations were filed, the State Bar began an investigation. I had discussions with the
State Bar, provided all infonnation requested, and fully cooperated in the investigation.
3.	 On July 9, 1998, I repaid $22,552.60 to Mr. Jones.
I acknowledge that the facts as set forth in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 are true. I am submitting my
resignation because I know if charges were predicated upon the misconduct under investigation, I could not
successfully defend against them.
