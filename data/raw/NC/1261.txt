as an independent contract paralegal for his law practice.

conduct real estate closings.
7.
For each real estate transaction Vesel closed, Vesel collected a legal fee

herselffor her share of Defendant's legal fee.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and the
evidence presented at the healing, the Hearing Panel hereby makes by clear, cogent and
convincing evidence the following:
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I. As a result of Defendant's misappropriation and failure to supervise, funds for
payoff of the Panish first mortgage were used for Defendant's personal benefit, t()r the
benefit of Driscoll, and/or to reimburse other clients' accounts.
2. After Defendant failed to payoff the Parrish first 1l101tgage at closing as required,
the Parrish home was subject to two mortgages for approximately two years while the
title insurance company litigated with Defendant over payment of the first mortgage with
Citi-Mortgage.
3. Foreclosure proceedings were instituted against the Parrish home because
Defendant failed to pay off their first mortgage at closing.
4. Defendant's failure to pay offthe Parrish first mortgage with Citi-Mottgage tor
more than two years after closing resulted in adverse reports to the credit agencies.
Consequently, the Parrishes's other creditors either increased their interest rate or sought
full payment of the lotal outstanding credit balance. The Parrishes's credit rating bas
been severely damaged. The Parrishes's credit continues to be negatively impacted by
Defendant's failure to timely pay off their mortgage with Citi-MOltgage.
5. When the Parrishes retained Defendant to conduct their refinance closing, they
trusted that Defendant, as their lawyer, would protect their interests. Mrs. Panish no
longer trusts that lawyers will protect her interests - her opinion of the legal profession
has been damaged by Defendant's misconduct.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE

The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27
N.C.A.C. 1B § .01l4(w)(1), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar, and concludes
that the following factors that warrant suspension or disbarment are present:
a. intent ofDefclldant to commit acts where the harm or potential han11 is
foreseeable;
b. circumstances reflecting Defendant's lack of honesty, lrustw0l1hincss,
or integrity;
c. elevation of Defendant's own interest above that of the client

that the following factors that wan-ant disbanl1cnt are present:
u. acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication; and
b. misappropriation or conversion of assets of allY kind to which the

other source.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27
N.C.A.C. IB § .01 14(w)(3), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar, and concludes
that the following are applicable in this matter:
3.

dishonest or selfish motive;

b. pattern of misconduct;
c. refusal to acknowledgc the wrongful nature of the conduct;
d. vulnerability of victim; and
e.
4.

19 years of experience in the practice oflaw.

Defendant put his own personal interests ahead of his clients' interests.

5.
By misappropriating entrusted client funds, Defendant has caused ham) to
the standing of the legal profession in that his conduct undennines the trust and
confidence that the public has in lawyers and the legal system.
6.
By failing to appear and pmticipate in this hearing Defendant showed
disregard for the lawyer self-regulation process, thereby causing hanl1 to the standing of
the legal profession.
7.
Mr. and Mrs. Parrish were Vllinerable in that they entrusted disbursement
ofthcir closing proceeds to Defendant by allowing the full amount oftllese proceeds to
be deposited into Defendant's trust account, an account to which they had no access.

10

8.
Defendant caused significant harm to Me. and Mrs. Parrish by
misappropriating their entrusted funds fTom Wachovia Account No.2.
9.
Defendant's misappropriation and failure to supcrvise caused significant
ha1111 to Mr. and Mrs. Parrish in that the funds for payoff of their first mortgage were
used for Defendant's personal benefit and the benefit of DriscolL
10.
Mr. and Mrs. Parrish suffered significant harm as a result of Defendant's
misconduct in that their home was subject to two mortgages for approximately two years
while the title insurance company litigated with Defendant over payment of their first
m0l1gage with CHi-Mortgage.
11.
Mr. and Mrs. Parrish suffered significant harm as a result of Defendant's
misconduct in that foreclosure proceedings were instituted against their homo.
12.

clients whose funds he was rcquired to hold ill his trust account but has failed to maintain
in trust.
15.
The Hearing Panel has considered all lesser sanctions including:
suspension, censure, reprimand and admonition, and finds that discipline less than
disbarment would not adequately protect the public from Defendant's future misconduct
for the following reasons:
a. Defendant committed a criminal act on multiple occasions, specifically
embezzlement, that reHects adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness
or fitness as a lawyer in other respects;
b. entry of an order imposing less gelious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Defendant committed and
would send the wrong message to lawyers and the public regarding the
conduct expected of members of the Bar oflhis State;
c. the protection of the public and the legal profession requires that
Defendant not be pClmitted to return to the practice oflaw until he
demonsh'ates the following by clear, cogent and convincing evidencc:
(i) that he has reto1111ed, (ii) that he possesses the moral qualifications
required for admission (0 practice law in North Carolina taking into
account the misconduct that is the subject of this order, (iii) that he

11

understands the current Rules of Professional Conduct, including but
not limited to those Rules relating to "Safekeeping Property" as set
forth in Rule 1,15 et seq,; and (iv) that reinstatement will no! be
detrimental to the public or the integrity and standing of the legal
profession. Disbannent is the only discipline that will require
Defendant to make such a showing before returning to the practice of

law,
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Faet, Conclusions of Law, Additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the
Hearing Panel hereby enters the following:
