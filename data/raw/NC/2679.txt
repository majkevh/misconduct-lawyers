The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and
disbarment, in considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
Based on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel makes the following:
Conclusions With Respect To Discipline

I.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different fonns of
discipline available to it. in addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง .01 14(w)(l) of the Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and concludes the following factors warrant suspension:
(a) Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential harm is
foreseeable, to wit: failing to conduct reconciliations and thus
compromising his ability to properly maintain and disburse entrusted
funds; and
(b) Potential negative impact of Defendant's actions on clients' or the

public's perception of the profession.
2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง .0114(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes no factors are present in this instance that would warrant disbannent.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. 1B ยง .OI14(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a) Absence of prior disciplinary offenses;
(b) Absence of a dishonest or selfish motive;

(c) A pattern of miscondUct;
(d) Multiple offenses;
(e) Cooperative attitude toward the proceedings; and
(f) Approximately twenty years of experience in the practice of law.

4.
Defendant's failure to properly maintain, manage, and handle entrusted
funds betrays a vital trust clients and the public place in attorneys and the legal
profession.

Order of Discipline
The North Carolina State liar v. Michael S. Williamson

Page 70f14

5.
Defendant's failure to maintain his clients' court costs and fines in trust
caused significant hann and potential significant harm. Defendant had to pay the court
costs and fines for those clients from his personal funds. Ifhe had not had the means to
do so, his clients' ability to timely and successfully resolve their cases would have been
at risk.

6.
Defendant's conduct, If contioued or tolerated by the Bar, poses
significant potential harm to future clients.

7.

The Hearing Panel has considered issuiog an admonition, reprimand or
censure but concludes that such disciplioe would not be suffioieht discipline because of
the gravity of the hann and potential hann to the clients. The Panel further concludes
that such discipline would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses committed
by Defendant and send the wrong message to attorneys regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar in this State.

8.
This Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and concludes that a
stayed suspension is necessary to ensure Defendant complies with necessary conditions
to avoid significant harm or the potential for significant hann to clients.
9.
for these reasons, this Hearing Panel frnds that an order imposiog
discipline short of a stayed suspension of Defendant's law license would not be
appropriate.

Findings of fact and Conclusion Regarding Discipline, and based upon the consent ofthe
parties, the Hearing Panel enters the following;
