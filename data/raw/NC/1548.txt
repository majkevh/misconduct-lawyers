28. Brdwtl· was sent proper notice of the disciplina,ry hearing of
December 2, 1988, but failed to appear at the hearing or to request a

Based' upon the foregoing FINDINGS OF FACT, the Committee makes the
following CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:
1. After he was discha:rged by Oba on April 27, 1988, Brown was
'entitled to compensation only in the amount of the reasonable value of his
services rendered as of the date of discharge;
- --- ---. "--.

2. Brown's refusal to :withdra.w unless he was paid $2, ooq" and his
assertion ot a $2,670 lien constituted an attempt to collect ~ clearly
excessive fee, in violation of Rule 2.6(a);
3. Brown failed to wit:hdraw when requested to do. so by a client, in
violation of, Rule 2 •. 8(b)(4).
.

4. Brown failed to provide aba with a release in a timely fashion, in
violation of Rule 2.8(a).
5. Brown"s f~ilure to 'responcl to the l,.etter of. Notice in a timely
f.ashion ~s a violation of G.S. 84-28(b)(3)'.
6.

Brown's failure to ,respond in a timely fashion to the B_ar' s. initial
of Nqtice, his lack of cQoperation throughout the Bar's
investigation of the allegations against him and his failure to attend the
clisciplinary hearing grossly aggravate the seriousness of the underlYing
offenses committed by Brown.
