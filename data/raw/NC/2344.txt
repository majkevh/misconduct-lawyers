p) By fah;ely advising Daye that he was negotiating a settlement in the
property case when in fact summary judgment ,had been entered in that matter,
G~ston engag~d ill conduct invo.1ving dishonesty, fraud, deceit'or
misrepresentatio.n in violation of Rule 8.4(c).
5. Gasto.n's misconduct is aggravated by the following fact()ts:
I';'

I

a) Multiple violations ofthe Revised Rules of Professional
Conduct.
b) Lack of cooperation with and obstruction of the investigatio.n
o.f the alle~ations in the State Bar's complaint.
c) Lack of restitution.
d) Gaston's misconduct was motivated in part by greed and ,
dishonesty.
'
(e) Prio.r discipline: an admonition ill April 2002 for failing to.
respond to. a form~r client's griev~ce, and an admonitio;n in
July 2002 for failing to. communicate with a client and filing a
late respon~e to another client's co.mplaint.
(f) A pattern of misconduct.

6. The hearing committee does not find that any mitigating facto.rs are
present:
7. The aggravating factors substantially outw<;:igh the 1,llitigating factors.

I

·8. Gaston's misconduct has caused significant harni to his clientsartd
o.ther members of the publi9and to. the admiIti.stration of justice.
9. Gasto.n's misco.nduct has also harmed the standing of the legal
profession by undermining his clients' trust and confidence in lawyers and the
legal system.

10. Gaston's repeated failures to. respond to letters of notice from the
State Ba,r and the 2'6th Judicial District Grievance Committee and his failures to.
participate in fee dispute mediation process undermine the State Bar's ability to.
regulate attorneys and undermines the privilege of lawyers in this state to remain
self regulating.

11. An order calling for discipline short of disbarm~nt would not
sufficiently protect the public for the folloWing reasons:
a. Gaston continued to practice law and continued to violate the Revised
Rules of Professional Conduct after his law license was suspended for
nonpayment of dues in May 200~ and it is thus apparent that 1;1. suspension. order is.
insuffitient to protect the public from :furAter instances of mi~.cop.duct. .
b. Gaston engaged in multiple viQlations of the Revi§¢d Rules of
. ProfeSSIonal Conduct over a lengthy period of time. His mi$conduct thus did not
arise :from the heat of the moment or a single mistake or act of bad judgment.
Some O:fhis misconduct involved serious dishonesty and is thus the result of a
character flaw that is not readily changeable.

I

c.

Gaston has failed to provide any assurances that he has addressed
whatever problem or charact~r flaw caused his misconduct ~d therefore there is a
substantial rIsk that he would engage in :tbrt1:ler miscond~ct if allowed to continue
of law.
the practice
,
!

"

4. Gaston has shown a persistent disregard for and unwillingness to be
bound by the Rules of Professional Conduct, orders of the Sl~te Bar and orders of
the SUPerior Courts of this State. The Commission therefore concludes that there
is substantial risk that Gaston would continue to engage in misconduct if allowed
to cO:Q,titlUe the practice of law.

,

e. Entry of an order imposing lesser discipline would fail to acknowledge
the seriousness of the offenses which Gaston committed, would be inconsistent
with orders of discipline entered by the Commission in si:tnil~ cases and would
send th~ wrong message to attorneys and the public reg~ding the conduct
expected of members of the Bar in this State.

f. The protection of the public requires that Gaston not be pennitted to
resume the practice of law until he demonstrates that he has refonned, that he
underst~ds his obligations to hi.s clients and that reinstatement would not injure
the standing of the legal profession. Disbarred attorneys must show refonnation
among other things, before they may resume the practice law, whereas no such
showing of refopnation is required of attorneys whose licenses are merely
suspended for a temi. certain.
