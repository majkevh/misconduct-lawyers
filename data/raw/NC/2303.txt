settlement, but never did. These ,assertions were not ,accurate. '

collect a settlement for her.

--

,,

FINDINGS OF FACT RELEVANT TO DISCIPLINE
1. Th~ violations of the Revised Rules of Professi9ilal Conduct by D~iley
are aggravated by the following factors:
.
a. Dailey has subst~tiaHprio! qiscipline:

I

i.

Dailey was disbarred in 1978 following his conViction of a
felony count.of receiving. stolen property.

11.

In January 1997, Dailey was reprimanded for failing to
cOllllTIunicate with a client and for neglecting the client's
appeal of his criminal conviction.

111.

In February 2000, Dailey was issued a letter of warning for
failing to respond promptly to a client's request for an .
accounting of fiduciary funds.

b. Dailey has engaged in a pattern of misconduct, which occurred over a
period of at least six years.
c. Dailey has violated muitiple provisions of the Revised,Rules of .
Professional Conduct.
d. Dailey has failed to make any restitution to his clients.
e. Dailey has substantial experience in the practice oflaw.

I

f. Both of Dailey's clients were vulnerable.
g. Dailey failed to file responses to the State Bar's discovery requests, as
directed by the Chair ofth~ Disciplinary Hearing Committee and is
therefore In contempt of the Committee and failed to appear at the .
disciplinary hearing, which hampered the Committee's ~bi1ity to
determine a c~use for his conduct.
h. Dailey engaged in dishonest conduct by misleading Ms.' Lee abotitthe
status of her son's case.

2. Dailey's conduct is mitigated by the following factors:
a. Dailey did not profit financially frolll his violations of the Rules.

7

I

,

,.

,,

b. Dailey admitted the allegations in the State Bar's complaint.
3. The aggtavating factors substantially outweigh the mitigating factors.
4. Dailey's misconduct caused significant actual hatni to his clients and
membets of the public as follows:
. a. Ms. Lee and Ms. Freeman were denied the opportunity to seek
compensation for t4eir sons' iriJ~es, as a result of Dailey's misconduct.
b. Ms. Lee suffered substantial e:p1otional distress as a result of Dailey's
·:misconduct.

I

c. Ms. Lee suffer~d damage to her credit because Dailey failed to notify
her creditors that her son's personal injury case was being negotiated
.andlor litigated and because he failed to assist her in repairing her credit
•rating as promised.
5. Dailey's misconduct has also' caused actual hann to the standin.g of the
legal profession by underminiIlg his clients'~trust and confidehce in lawyers and
the legal system.
!6. Dailey's failUre to respolld to the State Bat's letters of notice and his
failure to comply with the Chair's discovery order undermine the State Bar's
ability to regulate attorneys and undermines the privilege of lawyers in this state
to rem3;in self-regulating.

1. An order calling for discipline short of a substantial suspension of
Dailey'$ law license with appropriate conditions precedent for reinstatement,
would not sufficiently protect the public Jor the following reasons:
)

a. bailey engaged in multiple violati~ns of the Revised Rules of
Professional Conduct over a lengthy period of misconduct, as opposed to
an isolated act or mistake, and it therefore appears that his misconduct is
the result of some problem or p~rsonality d~fect that is not readily
changeable.

I

Dailey failed to provide an'y ass~ances that he h~ addressed
whatever problem or character flaw caused his misconduct and therefore
there is a substantial risk that his misconduct would be repeated ifhe is
permitted to continue to practice law.

b.

c.

Entry of art order imposing les$er discipline would fail to aclmowledge
tJle s~riousness of the offenses which Dailey committed, would be
inconsistent with orders of discipline entered by this body in similar cases

8

I

and would send the wrong message to attorneys regarding the conduct
expected of members of the Bar in this state.

d. The protection of the public requires that Dailey not be .p:e:nnitted to
resume the practice of l~w until he demonstrates that he undt;:rstands his
.ethical obligations to his clients, that he. understands principles of law·
office m~agement and that he is not suffering frO'ln any addiction or
mental illness or condition that prevents him from practicing law
competently.
.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions· of La,w, Findings
of Fact R~levantto Disciplin,e and the consent of the parties llQreto, the Ueariug
Committee hereby enters the following:
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE
1. The law license ofthe Defendant, Richard M. Dailey, is hereby
