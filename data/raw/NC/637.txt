10.
Goldsmith disbursed $2,000.00 from her trust account in the client matter
of MorselMcFadden but she had only deposited $1,000.00 into her trust account for that
matter.
II.
Goldsmith was served with a letter of notice from the North Carolina State
Bar on February 2, 2011. Goldsmith was required to respond to the letter of notice within
IS days of receipt. Goldsmith did not respond.

12.
Goldsmith subsequently contacted staff counsel for the State Bar in June
2011. Goldsmith was directed to produce required bank records by June 24, 2011 and
her written response by July 8, 20 II. Goldsmith failed to comply with these deadlines.
13.
On September 19,2011, the Wake County Superior Court entered an
injunction prohibiting Goldsmith from handling entrusted funds. The injunction order
also required Goldsmith to produce records as requested by the State Bar.
14.
The State Bar requested that Goldsmith produce records relating to clients
for whom Goldsmith handled entrusted funds.
IS.
Goldsmith failed to comply with the court's order and failed to produce
the records. Goldsmith did not produce the required records until held in contempt by the
court.
16.
After Goldsmith was held in contempt of court, Goldsmith produced the
required records and responded to requests for information.
17.
After the State Bar completed its audit, there remained the following two
disbursements for which the State Bar could not ascertain from which client's funds the
disbursements were being made:

6

a.

Check #1035 to Blackacre Title Agency, LLC for $150.00

b.

Counter check made payable to cash in the amount of$193.00

18.
The State Bar's audit showed that as of the end date of the audit period,
which was July 25, 20 II, Goldsmith had collected more for outstanding title insurance
premiums than she had left in the trust account, to wit: she had collected $4,169.80 for
title insurance premiums but her trust account balance was only $3,427.57.
19.
The deficiency in Goldsmith's trust account balance resulted from her
overdisbursement in client matters, bank and wire charges being deducted from the trust
account, and the counter check debit.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Hearing Panel enters the
following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
I.
All parties are properly before the Hearing Panel and the Panel has
jurisdiction over Defendant and the subject matter of this proceeding.
2.
Defendant's conduct, as set out in the stipulated Findings of Fact above,
constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28(b)(2) as follows:
(a)

By failing to promptly complete final opinions of title and disburse title
insurance premiums, Goldsmith failed to act with reasonable diligence and
promptness in representing her clients in violation of Rule 1.3 and failed to
promptly disburse entrusted funds in violation of Rule 1.15-2(m);

(b)

By disbursing more funds for clients than she had in her trust account for
those clients, Respondent failed to properly hold and maintain entrusted
funds in violation of Rule 1.15-2(a) and used entrusted funds for the
benefit of herself or third persons other than the legal or beneficial owners
of those funds in violation of Rule 1.15-20);

(c)

By withdrawing, or allowing another to withdraw, funds from her trust
account by a counter check made payable to cash, an item was drawn on
Respondent's trust account made payable to cash in violation of Rule
1.15-2(i);

(d)

By failing to include adequate identifying information on checks written
from her trust account, Respondent failed to show on her checks the client
balance against which whose items were being drawn in violation of Rule
1.15-3(b)(2);

(e)

By failing to respond to the State Bar's letter of notice and requests for
documents, Respondent knowingly failed to respond to a lawful demand
7

for infonnation from a disciplinmy authority in violation of Rule 8.1 (b);
and
(f)

By failing to produce records as required by the injunction entered by the
Wake County Superior Court until after she was held in contempt,
Respondent engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice
in violation of Rule 8.4(d).

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and the
evidence presented at hearing, the Hearing Panel finds by clear, cogent, and convincing
evidence the following
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE

I.
Goldsmith's failure to respond to the State Bar's letter of notice and
request for documents impeded and delayed the State Bar's audit of her trust account,
interfering with the State Bar's efforts to ensure appropriate handling of entrusted funds.
2.
Goldsmith's failure to respond to the State Bar and the inadequate client
identification on the bank records the State Bar obtained from the bank necessitated that
the State Bar obtain an injunction from the Wake County Superior Court prohibiting
Goldsmith from handling entrusted funds, in order to protect the public.
3.
Goldsmith's failure to comply with the injunction order's provision that
she produce records as requested by the State Bar under the order required the State Bar
to have her held in contempt in order to gain her compliance.
4.
Goldsmith's failure to respond to the State Bar and produce the requested
records caused expenditures of disciplinary and judicial time and resources that could
have been avoided, and undennined the privilege of lawyers in this State to remain selfregulating.
5.
Goldsmith's failure to timely complete final title opinions and disburse
premiums created the potential for significant harm should a title claim arise after the
expiration of the title commitment, and interfered with her clients' goal of obtaining title
Insurance.
6.
Although there is no evidence Goldsmith intentionally overdisbursed
funds to herself or to others, Goldsmith's failure to follow proper trust account
management and record-keeping procedures resulted in mishandling of entrusted funds
and in overdisbursements.
7.
. Goldsmith's overdisbursements, although unintentional, left her with
insufficient funds for clients for whom she has not yet obtained title insurance, interfering
with those clients' goal of obtaining title insurance.

8

8.
After examination of Goldsmith's client files, the State Bar ultimately
found that the attorney fee disbursements Goldsmith made by checks that failed to
contain the client's name listed in paragraph 7 of the initial Findings of Fact section
above were appropriate fee disbursements. Goldsmith's failure to include the client's
name on the fee disbursement check delayed proper identification by the State Bar,
however.
9.
Goldsmith's failure to respond to the State Bar resulted in potential
significant harm to the legal profession. The legal profession is entrusted with the
privilege of self-regulation. This self-regulation requires participation in the process by
attorneys. When attorneys fail to participate, they jeopardize the profession's ability to
remain self-regulating and they obstruct the State Bar's efforts to fulfill its statutory
mandate.
10.

Goldsmith has no prior discipline.

II.
Goldsmith has indicated that she experienced personal or emotional
problems during the time period at issue.
12.
After being held in contempt by the Wake County Superior COUli,
Goldsmith has been cooperative with the State Bar's investigation of the conduct
described herein.
13.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and
disbarment, in considering the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
Based on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the additional
Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of
discipline available to it. In addition, the Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors
enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB § .OI14(w)(l) of the Rules and Regulations of the North
Carolina State Bar and concludes the following factors warrant suspension of
Defendant's license:
(a)

Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential harm is
foreseeable;

(b)

Negative impact of Defendant's actions on client's or public's perception
of the profession;

(c)

Negative impact of Defendant's actions on the administration of justice;

9

(d)

Impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the
representation;

(e)

Effect, and potential effect, of Defendant's conduct on third parties; and

(f)

Multiple instances offailure to participate in the legal profession's selfregulation process.

2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. 1B § .01 14(w)(2) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes no factors are present in this instance that would warrant disbarment.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in
27 N.C.A.C. 1B § .0114(w)(3) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State
Bar and concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a)

Absences of prior disciplinary offenses;

(b)

Lack of timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify
consequences of misconduct;

(c)

Indifference to making restitution;

(d)

Defendant engaged in multiple offenses;

( e)

Defendant engaged in a pattern of misconduct;

(f)

Effect of personal or emotional problems on the conduct in question;

(g)

Defendant's lack of interim rehabilitation;

(h)

Defendant's full and free disclosure to the Hearing Panel but not a
cooperative attitude toward the proceedings;

(i)

Defendant's remorse; and

G)

Defendant's lack of experience in the practice ofIaw.

4.
Defendant's failure to properly maintain, manage, and handle entrusted
funds betrays a vital trust clients and the public place in attorneys and the legal
profession.
5.
Defendant's conduct, if continued or tolerated by the Bar, poses potential
significant harm to future clients and the profession.

10

6.
The Hearing Panel has considered issuing an admonition, reprimand or
censure but concludes that such discipline would not be sufficient discipline because of
the gravity of the potential harm to the clients. The Panel further concludes that such
discipline would fail to acknowledge the seriousness of the violations committed by
Defendant and send the wrong message to attorneys regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar in this State.
7.
This Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and concludes that a
suspension is necessary to adequately protect the public from future misconduct by
Defendant.
8.
For these reasons, this Hearing Panel finds that an order imposing
discipline short of suspension of Defendant's law license would not be appropriate.
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and the
Findings of Fact and Conclusions regarding discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the
following:
