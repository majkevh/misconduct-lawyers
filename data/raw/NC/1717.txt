On January 16, 1992, the Grievance Camnittee of' the North carolina state'
, Bar~met and considered the grievance filed against you by ,Wi~ Stewart., .

Pursuant "b;> section 13 (A) of article IX o1! tl1e 'Rules and 'Regulations 6f '

, cause. Probable cause is 'defined in the rules as "reasonable caUse to believe

"

"

'Ihe rules provide that after a fin:i.i.rg of probable caupe" the Grievance

,
A reprirn,arrl is a written fom of discipli,ne no~ s;erious than an,
admonitioI} issued in cases in which an attorney has violated one or more
provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct and has caused harin or
" potential harin to a client, the administration ot justice, the pro;f~ion, ,or
a 1ne.Inberof the public" bUt the nrls<::onduct does not requ;ire a censure.
'
'Ihe Grievance Conunit;tee was of the opinion that a cens;ure is not ~
in this case and isSues this reprimarxi to Y0'4. As c;.hainnan of the GrieVgnce,
Committee of the North Cqrolina state Bar, it is now my duty to issue this
reprimcm:l and I am certain that you will urrlerstard ftilly the spirit in whiCh
this duty is perfornm.
You were appointed guardian 'Of TOOd Jones, an i.nCo1i1petent, in OctOber,
1989. Despite several reiquests by ~ Wake County Clerk of SUperior Coqrt,
you failed to file a 90-day inventory or any aI1l1Wll accountings regarding
,
Jones' estate. You were ultimately rem:::7Ved as gtJatdian in June 1991 for your .
failure to file these accountings. You were ordered at that time by the, clerk
to file a final ac:x::ou.nting withitl 30 days. You also fa;i.ledto cCmtply with

this order.
By failin:J'to file proinpt accountings in the Jones estate as 'required by
law and by ignorin:J the, clerk's order to ,file a final ac:x:::qunting, you..
. ' ,
neglected a legal matter entrusted to you, in violation of Rule 6(B) (3) of the ,
Rules of ProfeSsional Corrluct. 'ihe fact that you have a busy practiCe is not
an excuse for neglect:in:;J' other client matters. As the Co1mneI1t to Rule 6(13) (3)
points out, an attorney should never urxiert,ake nore matterS than he or she can
