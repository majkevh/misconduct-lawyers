ORDER RESTORING MEMBER TO
ACTIVE STATUS

I

This matter came on to be heard and was heard on June 26, 1997 by a hearing committee
composed of James R. Fox, Chair, Kenneth M. Smith and James Lee Burney upon a petition
filed, by Mary Elizabeth Manton (hereinafter Manton) seeking to be restored to active status as a
member of the North Carolina State Bar. The hearing committee, after consideration of the
petition and the evidence presented to the hearing committee, finds the following to have been
demonstrated by clear, cogent and convincing evidence:
FINDINGS OF FACT
1. .Manton is a member of the North Carolina State Bar, having been licensed in 1984.

2. As a result of work related stress, Manton, who was then the federal public defender
for the Eastern District of North Carolina, was placed on disability inactive status by Fourth
Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Samuel J. Ervin, III. Manton voluntarily ceased practicing law in
November, 1995.
3. After being placed on inactive status by Judge Ervin, friends convinced Manton to
consult a psychologist, William B. Scarborough, Ph.D. Dr. Scarborough recommended that
Manton voluntarily admit herselfto Holly Hill Ho~pital in February, 1996.

I

4. While at Holly Hill, Manton was assigned to the care of a psychiatrist, Dr. Ernest
Raba, MD Manton has continued to see Dt. Raba from her admission at Holly Hill through the
date of this hearing. Manton has also continued to see Dr. Scarborough regularly.
5. Soon after her admission to Holly Hill, Dr. Raba diagnosed Manton as suffering from
bipolar disorder and began to treat her with appropriate medication.
6. In July, 1996, Manton failed to take her medication and suffered a relapse.
7. After causing a disturbance at a committee meeting of the North Carolina State Bar in
Pinehurst, NC, Manton was temporarily involuntarily committed by order of the Moore County

District Court on July 24, 1996. After being transported to pomthea Dix Hospital in Raleigh,
NC, Manton voluntarily ~dmitted herself and remained there -until July 30, 1996 when she was
released. As a result, the involuntary cOII11llitment procee.ding w~ dismissed.
8. O~ October 14, 1996, Manton was transferred to disability inactive status by order of
the Secretary ofthe North Carolina State.Bar pursuant to 27 N. C. Admin. Code, Chapter 1,
Subchapter B, ยง .0118(a).

I

9. It is not uncommon fot patients with bipolar disorder to fail to take me,dication
appropriately after they begin to feel normal as a result of the benefits of the medication.
10. After her release from Dorothea Dix, Dr. Raba began to educate Manton concerning
her need to continue to take her medication even after feeling normal, and to report to him any
changes in how she feels so that further episodes such as the one she experienced in July, 1996
can be avoide.d.
11. The July, 1996 episode had a profound effect on Manton~ and she has since taken her
medication and has adequately reported changes in her condition to Dr. Raba.
12. As a result of compliance with Dr. Raba's treatment recommendations since July,
1996, Manton is no longer disabled. However, Manton is subject to a possible relapse and needs
to be monitored to ensure that she continues to follow her psychiatrist's treatment
recommendations.
13. Manton has consented to conditions being placed upon her reinstatement to active
status and has agreed to provide a release. permitting her psychiatrist to report periodically to the
North Carolina State Bar respecting whether she is following her treatment plan and if, in the
opinion of the psychiatrist, she again becomes disabled.

license to be reinstated and maintained in an active status:
