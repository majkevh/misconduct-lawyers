Defendant's conduct as set forth in the Findings of Fact above, constitutes
grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(2) in that Defendant
violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as follows:
(a)

By failing to promptly reimburse the trust account for shortages that were
created in the account by clerical errors and his failure to stop payment on
two checks before issuing duplicate checks, Pardue failed to maintain
entrusted property in accordance with the rules in violation of Rule 1.152(a) and used entrusted property for the personal benefit of persons other
than the legal or beneficial owners of that property in violation of Rule
1.1S-2(j);

(b)

By failing to reconcile the total of all individual client ledger balances for

the requisite quarterly reconciliations of his general trust account in
violation of Rule US-3(d);

By failing to provide each client with a written accounting of his or her
trust account balance at least annually, Pardue failed to provide written
accountings of the receipt and disbursement of all trust funds to clients in
violation of Rule US-3(e); and

(e)

By disbursing funds from the trust account to himself and others on behalf

account, Pardue failed to maintain entrusted property in accordance with
the rules in violation of Rule US-2(a) and used entrusted property for the
personal benefit of persons other than the legal or beneficial owners ofthat
property in violation of Rule 1.15-20).

action after a conflict of interest arose between a limited partner and the general partner
concerning the disbursement of net sales proceeds.

NCSB v. Pardue
Page 4 of9

2.
Pardue began conducting three-way reconciliations of his trust account
quarterly, and sometimes monthly, after he received the results of the procedural audit.
In the beginning, the three-way reconciliations that Pardue conducted
3.
revealed that Pardue had disbursed for some clients more funds from the trust account
than he deposited in trust on their behalf.

4.
Pardue promptly reimbursed the trust account for the excess
disbursements described in the foregoing paragraph.
In 2013, although Pardue did not make any disbursements prior to making
5.
the deposit, he still disbursed entrusted funds by checks that were dated before the
deposit.

6.
Pardue cooperated with the State Bar's investigation into his handling of
entrusted client funds.
Based upon the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law above and the
Additional Findings of Fact Regarding Discipline, and with the consent of the parties, the
Hearing Panel makes the following:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27 N.C.A.C.
1B ยง .0114(w)(I), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar, and concludes that the
following factors that warrant suspension or disbarment are present:
(a) Negative impact of defendant's actions on client's or public's perception
of the profession.
2. The Hearing Panel has considered all ofthe factors contained in 27 N.C.A.C.
1B ยง .0114(w)(2), the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar, and concludes that no
factors that warrant disbarment are present.
3. The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors contained in 27 N.C.A.C.
1B ยง .0114(w)(3), the Rules and Regulations ofthe State Bar, and concludes that the
following are applicable in this matter:
(a) Prior disciplinary offense in North Carolina;

(g) Good character and reputation; and
(h) Defendant has been licensed to practice law for approximately thirty-three
years.
4. Defendant caused potential significant harm to his clients by failing to

5. The Hearing Panel has considered all lesser sanctions including: censure,
reprimand and admonition, and finds that discipline less than suspension would not
adequately protect the public from Defendant's future misconduct because (i) ofthe
gravity of potential significant harm to clients, and (ii) a period of reporting pursuant to a
stayed suspension is necessary to ensure Defendant's proper handling of entrusted funds.
