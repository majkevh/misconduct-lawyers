AFFIDAVIT OF
SURRENDER OF LAW LICENSE

DARIN P. MEECE, Attorney,
Respondent

Darin P. Meece, being first duly sworn, deposes and says as follows:
1.

I desire to surrender and hereby tender my license to practice law in North Carolina.

2. My surrender is freely and voluntarily rendered. It is not the result of coercion or duress.
I am fully aware of the implication of submitting my surrender.
3. I am aware that there is a pending investigation by the State Bar regarding allegations
that I misappropriated $15,000.00 of fiduciary funds by causing a check to be issued from my
law finn trust account to a business entity I control at a time when I was neither authorized to
remove the funds nor entitled to any portion of them.
4.

I acknowledge that the material facts upon which the investigation is predicated are true.

5. I am submitting my resignation because I know that if disciplinary charges were
predicated upon the misconduct under investigation, I could not successfully defend against
them.
