KEITH L. CIARK
ATIORNEY AT lAW

On October 21, 1992, the Grievance Cormnittee of the North carolina state
'Bar met and considered the grievance filed against you by William F. Blauw.

Pursuant to section 13 (A) of article IX of. the P;ules and Regulations of
the North carolina state Bar, the Grievance Committee conducted a preliminary
hearing. After considering the info:rma.tion available to it, inciuding your
, resrx:>nse to the letter of notice, the Grievance Committee found probable
cause~ ,Probable cause is defined in the rules as "reasonable cause to beli~ve
that a member of the North carolina state Bar is guilty of misconduct
justifying disciplinary action."
The rules provide that after a firrlin:J of probable cause, the Grievance
Cormnittee, may detennine that the filing of a carrplaint and a hearing before
the Disciplinary Hearing Cormnission are not required and the Grievance
Cormnittee may issue various levels of discipline depen::ling upon the
misconduct, the actual or potential injury caused, and any aggravating or
mitigating factors. The Grievance Committee may issue an admonitibn,
reprlinand, or censure to the respoooent atto:rney.

I

A repd.maoo is 'a written fonn of discipline more serious than an
,admonition isSued in ~ in which an atto:rney has vioiated one or more
provisionS of the Rules of Professional Conduct and has caused hann or
potential, hann to a client" the administration of justice, the profession, or
a member of the public, lJut the misconduct does not require a censuJ:'e.
The Grievance Committee was of the opinion that a censure is not required
'in this case ,and issueS this reprimarrl to you. As chai:rma.n 'of the Grievance
Cormnittee of the North carolina state Bar, it is ndN my duty ,to issue this
repr.iroand and I am certain that you will urrlerstarrl fully the'spirit in which
this duty is perfonned. :
' ,
You represented the complainant, William F. Blauw, and his wife, Diana
, Blauw, in a lawsuit againSt jart'eS D. Killian and wife, Wilma J. Killian, the
defendants in the action rocwed for summary judgment., You did' not appear at

for tile defendants that you ,did not intend 'to argue the motion for surrnnary
jud~t and you would not be in court on that day. You advised defendants'

In your response to ~e Bla~:' grievance, y,ou irxlicated ~t: one ,of t.l)e, ,
reasol1$ you did not appear at;. the"h~~ on the ilY::rl:;.ion for ~ j,Udgil\eht "'~J,',i~,+ '
was that you l;lelieved the Blauws had ~oned their case. ,YOU, did" not '
pr~t any evidence to show that the Blauws had abarxloned the~ ~'qnd' thus
you were not justified in your failure to appear at th~ hearing on the m:;>tion
for ~ judgmEmt.

i,

'!he court records' further show that the Kil,lians served a reqtl6$t for
production of ,documents upon you as counsel for the Blauws. You' requ.ested an,
,extension of time to resporrl to' this ~, but you neverth~l~ fa,iled to
, , , respond. '!he Killiaris moved for a order to carrpel the Blauws to '~rrl, to
the product~on of documents. .

'!he Killians' attorney, Rl,1s~1 L. Mclean; J;II, moved for ',Rule:U
sanctions in this case. '!he court fourrl that the complaint you filed on
behalf ot the Blauws was not v~ified by th~.. '!be court also 'foun:t t.hat you
did not file, an affidavit in opposition of t,pe SUI1'Ulla.1:Y judgment. . Finhlly, the
court held that from the record-there qppeared to be no basis ,iri fact for the
fj,.ling of the complaint.' '!he Blauws were ordered to pay $1,397 .00 as.
'
attorney's fees for Mr. Mclean. You have irrlieq't;:ed that you '6V@1"t;t.1a1.iy. paid
the attorney's fees assessed against the Blauws~

Your failure to apPear and offer' arg\nnents
the ll'Dtion 'for ~,
judgmEmt hearing is in violation of Rule 6(B) (3) and Rule 7 .1(A) (1), (2) and
(3) of the Rules of Professional Cbrrluct. A lawyer has an' obligation to
zealouply represent the interests of his client. 'Itl~tore, you ~OUld hq,ve
appeared' at the hearing on the st.mnnary judgmEmt n'ption. Your fail1J+6 to
appear and represent your clients at the si.mtmal:y' judgmEmt motion pearingwas
,essentially an abandornnent of your clients' cia:i,m.
Your delay in responding to the Killians' r$:IUest for p:r6duct~Qh of
documents violates Rule 6(B) (3). You have an obligation to act with
reasonable diligence and promptness in repreSenting your client. ,A lawyer' s
procrastination can often adversely affect his client's in~t;.; Cl§; was the
case in this matter.
'
You violated Rule 6(l3) (1) of the Rules of Professional Conduct when you
did not kE:!eP the Blauws WoJ;ined of the lOCltion fpr st.mnnary judgment, its
outcome, and the Rule 11 sanctions lOCltion and its--outcome. YOl,lr cJ;i~t is
entitled to know about those,matters wh;i.ch affect his legal 9;La:i,m~ 'l\n
'attorney c:::atm0t keetJ the client, in the dark abOut those matters,evert:i.f, those
matters reflect adversely on 'the lawyer.'
,
'!he Grievance Conunittee was concerned that you did not respol'ldtimely ~
'·follow-upquestions regard,ing this grievance as p~ted' in
letter,dated '
Septembei- 21, 1992. Rule 1.1 (B) requires a lawyer to resporrl to a 'lawf\.U
demand for infonnation from a disciplinary authority.
