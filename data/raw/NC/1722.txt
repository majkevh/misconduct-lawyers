A censure is a Written fo:pn of discipline more serious than a
reprimand, issued. in cases in which an attorney has violated one or mQre
'provisions of the lillles of Professional Conducta,nd has cauSed signi;ficar,it
hann oi:" potential significant hann to a client, the administration of
justice, the profession or a mel:l1Per of the public, but the misconduct dOes
not require suspension of theattol;116Y's license.

, You repl:"esented Mrs. Marilyn Ridge in seVeral domestic nia:tters. :ey
, contract dated FebruarY 5, 1992, you' agreed to "represent Mrs. Ridge .in •
claims aga:i,nst Robert Baechtold, BE: a' prenuptial agreement and/or dOl1'\?Stio
matters". You cparged Mrs. Ridge a retainer of $300 and a ,one-third
contingent fee of any settlement, verdict or recovery obtained. ' The
prenuptial agreement entered into by Mrs. Ridge and Mr. Baechtold involVed,
inter alia) ternporru:y aJ,.iI:nony. On February 11" 1~92, you fil~ a lqwsuit on
behalf of Mrs. Ridge wherein you asked that Mr. Baechtold pay alimony to
Mrs. Ridge for a minimum of one year as provided by the prenuptial
agreement.
The February 5, 1992 contingent fee contract violated Rule 2.6 (A)o:f

excessive fee. since yeur contingent fee contract at a minimum seught a
contingent fee based upon Mr. :i3a.echteld' s temporary alimony ebligatien, the,
contract was veid and against pUblic policy • The law in this state is
'clear that a d::ontingent fee contract fer·representatioh. in a diverce
proceeding is prohiPited. Thompsen v. Thompsen, 313 N.C. 313, 328 S.E.2d
288 (1985). Furthennor$, the law in tpis state is clear that a contingent
fee ¢ontract fer alimony' er child support is also veid. Davis v. Tayler,
81 N.C APp. 4~, 344 S.E.2d. 19 (1986).
-In addition, the Grievance Committee ·was concerned about yeur attempt
to' structure the reselutien ef Mrs. Ridge's domestic dispute a$ a
settlement. T,he Grievance conunittee belieVed that' the displ,lte could have
been reselved' by a censent erd.~. Ye\J. hav~ $tated that yeu theught the
settlement agreement weuld best proteCt Mrs. Ridge's interest. HoWever, 1:1' ....
consent erder ceuld p:i;"ovide the same pretection ef her interest and in fact
a consent erdE?r was prepared by a SUbsequent attorney without the use ef a
settlement agreement.

I

The Griev@ce conunittee theught that yeur attempt to' cast the,
tenninatien ef the domestic dispute as a settlement was an attempt to' allow
, you to enfor~ the contingent fee contract Which was veid as a rna.tter ef
public' policy ~ Your conduct in this respect. violates Rules 2.6 (A) and
1.2 (D).

You are hereby censured by tl)e Neri:P Carolina state Bar fer. yeur
vielatien ef the Rules of PrefeSsienal COnduct. The Grievance Committee
trusts that you will ponder this censure, recognize the errer that yeu have
made, and that yeu will never again allOw yeurseif to depart from adherence
to' 'the high et:h~cal standards 'ef the legi;ll prefession. Thi$ censure should
serve as a strong reminper. and inducement fOr you to weigh carefully in the
future your responsibility to the public, your clients, your fellow
atterneys and the Courts, to' the. end that yeu demean yourself as a
':respected member of the legal prof~sionwhbse conduct may be relied upon
without qUestion.

In 'accerdanCe with the policy adopted october 15, 1981 by the Council
, ef the North carolina state Bar regarding the taxing ef the administrative
and investigative cOsts to arty atterney issued a censure by the Grievance
Conunittee, the costs of this actien in the amount ef $50.00 are hereby
taxed to yeu.
