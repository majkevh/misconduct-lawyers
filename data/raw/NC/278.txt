CONCLUSIONS OF LA W
I.
All the parties are properiy before the Hearing Panel and the Panel has
jurisdiction over Dcfendant, Mildred A. Akachukwu, and the subject matter.
2.
Knowing and willli.i1 misappropriation ai' money by a fiduciary constitutes the
crime ofembezzlcment under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-90. Embezzlement is a felony.
3.

Defendant knowingly and willfully misappropriated entrusted funds on multiple

occasions over several years.
4.
Defendant's conduct, as sct forth in the Findings of I' act abovc, constitute grounds
for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-28(b)(2) in that Dcfcndant violated the Rules 01'
Profcssional Conduct as follows:
a. By knowingly and willfully misappropriating client funds for herself or for the
benefit of third persons for her personal purposes, Akachukwu engaged in
criminal conduct reflecting adversely on her honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as
a lawyer in violation of Rule 8.4(b) and cngaged in conduct involving dishonesty,
fraud, deceit, or misrcprcsentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c); and.
b. By disbursing funds for clients from her attorney trust account when she did not
have sufficient funds in her attorney trust account for those elients to support
those disbursements and thereby knowingly and willfully misappropriating and
misusing other clients' fi.lIlds, Akachukwu failed to protect entrusted Funds in
violation of Rule 1.15-2(a), failed to properly disburse client funds in violation of
Rule 1.15-2(m), engaged in criminal conduct reflecting adversely on her honesty,

trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in violation of Rule 8.4(b) and engaged in
conduct involving dishonesty, fi-aud, deceit, or misrepresentation in violation of
Rule 8.4(c).

-8-

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the Hearing Panel
hereby finds by clear, cogent and convincing evidence the following additional
FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
I.

The Iindings in paragraphs 1 -20 above are reincorporated as if set forth herein.

Defendant's conduct involved misappropriation, misrepresentation and deceit
2.
over a period of years.

3.
Defendant, by engaging in conduct involving misappropriation, misrepresentation
and deceit over a number of years, has shown herselfto be untrustworthy.
4.

Defendant put her own personal interests ahead of her clients' interest.

5.
Defcndant misappropriated funds for her own beneIit that should have been used
for the benefit of her clients. Subscqucntly, in ordcr to make thc payments due for those clients,
Dcfendant then misappropriated funds that should have been used for other clients.
6.
Defendant wrote checks out to Saba Zewdu and Redell Harris, fraudulently signcd
their names to the back of those chccks without their knowlcdge, permission, or authorization,
and dcposited those funds into hcr pcrsonal bank account. The money she put into her personal
account should have been maintained and used to pay the medical expenses for Ms. Zewdu and
Mr. Harris. If those funds were not needed to satisfY medical bills or related liens, then thosc
funds should have been disbursed to Ms. Zewdu and Mr. I-larris. Instead, Akachukwu
transferred their money to her personal bank account at a time when her personal account had a
negative balance and spent those funds over the next several months.
7.
Defendants' misappropriations eventually caused her trust accounl balance to get
so low that she received two notices of insul1icient limds from the bank, one for August 2008
ancl another for April 2009. At the time orthnse insufficient funds notices, she should have been
maintaining funds for clients in excess of the balance left in her trust account, including as
lui lows:

a.

Akachukwu received an insufIicient Ilmds notice for a check negotiated on
August 26, 2008. At that time, thc balance in her trust account was
$761.43. By August 28, 2008, her trust account balance had fallen to
$61.43. On August 28, 2008, Akachukwu should have had the following
clients' funds in her trust account:

I)
2)
3)
4)
5)

$4,334.00 for Jose Escobar
$588.00 luI' Juan Garcia
$520.00 for Gerardo Godinez
$2,000.00 tur Carlos Reyes
$6,800.00 for Octavia Villa.

-9-

b. Akachukwu received an insufficient funds notice for a check negotiated on
April 3, 2009. At that time, the balance in her trust account was $334.25.
On April 3, 2009, Akachukwu should have had the following clients'
lemds in her trust account:
I)
2)
3)
4)

$ I2,868.81 for Froilan Gonzalez Garcia
$8,334.00 for Francisco Juarez
$673.00 for Frank Pettiford
$492.00 for Omotayo Odulana

8.
Defendant misappropriated funds from her clients, who were particularly
susceptible to Defendant's theft because these clients entrusted their funds to Defendant and
relied upon Defendant to hold their funds and disburse them for their benefit.
9.
Defendant's conduct damaged her clicnts and can only have a negative impact on
her clients' and the public's perception of the legal profession.
10.
Defendant has deposited large sums of money into her trust account to reimburse
the trust account for her misappropriations.
1 I.

Defendant has no prior record of disciplinary offenses.

12.
Defendant has failed to acknowledge that she misappropriated client funds.
Defendant has provided explanations that are not consistent with the evidence received at the
hearing in this matter.
Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings
Regarding Discipline, the Hearing Panel enters the following
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLfNE
The I-fearing Panel carclully considered all of the different forms of discipline
I.
available to it.
2.
The Hearing Panel considcred all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C.A.C. IB
§ .01 14(w)(I), (2) and (3) of the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar and determined that the
following factors are applicable:
27 N.C.A.C. IB § .01 14(w)(1)
a.

b.

Factor (8), Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential
harm is foreseeable;
Factor (C), Circumstances re/lecting Defendant's lack of honesty,
trustworthiness, or integrity;

- I0-

c.

Factor (D), Elevation of Defendant's own interest above those of her
clients;

d.

Factor (l), Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication;

27 N.C.A.C. IB § .0 I 14(w)(2)
e.

Factor (A), Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit or fabrication;

f.

Factor (C), Misappropriation or conversion of assets of any kind to which
Defendant or recipient was not entitled, whether tram a client or any other
source;

g.

Factor (D), Commission of a felony;

27 N.C.A.C. IB § .01 14(w)(3)

3.

h.

Factor (A), No prior record of disciplinary offenses;

i.

Factor (C), Dishonest or selfish motive;

J.

Factor (D), Timely good faith efforts to make restitution;

Ie

Factor (F), A pattern of misconduct;

I.

Factor (G), Multiple offenses;

nl.

Factor (K), Absence of full and free disclosure to the Hearing Panel;

n.

Factor (R), Vulnerability of the victims; and

o.

Factor (S), Substantial degrce of experience in the practice of law.

Dcfcndant caused significant harm to her clients by misappropriating their funds.

4.
Defendant caused significant harm to Ms. Zewdu and Mr. Harris, by endorsing
checks made payable to them without their authorization and depositing those amounts into hcr
personal account.

5.
Defendant causcd significant harm to clients whose funds Akachukwu should
have had in her trust account at times when checks were returned for insufficicnt funds from her
trust account, including clients J~'roilan Gonzalez Garcia, Francisco Juarez, Frank Pettiford,
Omotayo Odul"n", Jose Escobar, Juan Garcia, Gerardo Godinez, Carlos Reyes, and Octavia
Villa.

-I 1-

6.
Defendant's repeated COml111SSl0n of criminal acts reflecting adversely on her
honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer caused potential significant harm to the legal
profcssion, in that criminal conduct tcnds to bring thc legal profession into disrepute.
7.
The Hearing Panel has considered lesser alternatives and finds that suspension of
Defendant's license or a public censure, reprimand, or admonition would not be sufficicnt
discipline because of the gravity of thc actual and potential harm to hcr clients, the public, the
administration of justice, and the legal profession caused by Defendant's conduct, and the threat
of potential significant harm Defendant poses to the publie.
8.
The Hearing Panel considered all lesser sanctions and finds that discipline short of
disbarment would not adequately protect the public for the following reasons:
a.

Defendant committed misdeeds involving moral turpitudc and violations
of hcr clients' trust, including fraudulent conduct, material
misrepresentations, and deceit. Misconduct involving misappropriation
and dishonesty are among the most serious that an attorney can commit.
Such otTenses demonstrate that the offending attorney is not trustworthy.
Clients are entitled to have trustworthy attorneys;

b.

Defendant repcatedly engaged in criminal acts reflecting adversely on her
honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer, and engaged in abuses of
trust by misappropriating funds entrusted to her;

c.

Entry of an ordcr imposing less serious discipline would fail to
acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Defendant committed and
would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the
conduct expected ofmembcrs ofthe Bar of this State; and

d.

The protection of the public and the legal profession requires that
Defendant not be perm itted to resume the practice of law until she
demonstrates the following: that she has reformed; that she understands
her obligations to her clients, the public, and the legal profession; and that
permitting her to practice law will not be detrimental to the public or the
integrity and standing of the legal profession or the administration of
justice. Disbarred lawyers are required to make such a showing before
they may resume practicing law.

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and additional Findings of
Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the I-tearing Panel hereby enters the
following
ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

1.

Defendant, Mildred A. Akachukwu, is hereby DISBARRED from the practice of
