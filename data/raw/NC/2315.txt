I

..

..
i. Miyashita has failed to aclmowledge true remorse or responsibility for
her misconduct and in fact, the exhibits, including pleadings she has filed in the

! .9. The aggravating factors substantially outweigh the mitigating factors.
Based on the foregoing Findings ofFa.ct, the hearing cominittee hereby

..
.
I

I

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
• 1. By faili;ng to refund the unearned portion of the fee which she was
paid ~y Blanco, Miyashita retain~d and/or collected ail excessive fee in violation
ofRuie 1.5.
.
, 2. By failing to respond to the letter of notice regarding the grievances of
Blanco, Ramos-Flores and Ramos, Miyashita failed to respond to a lawful
demand for information from a disciplinary authority, in violation of Revised
Rule $.1(b).
I

! 3. Miyashita's misconduct caused significant harm to Blanco, in that his
iimnigration matter was delayed owing to her neglect and he has yet to recover
the $3:50 fee which he paid to; her in 1995.

'4. Miyashita's misconduct caused significant harm to Rattlos-Flores and
Ramo~ in that she failed to return their client files, thus hampering their ability to

retain pther couns~l and proceed in a timely fashion with their immigration cases.
5. Miyashita;s'misconduct has' ~lso caused actual harm to the standing of
the legal profession by undermining her clients' trust and confidence in lawyers
and the legal system.

I

6. Miyashita's failure to respond to the State Bar's letter of notice
undenmnes the State Bar's ability to regulate attorneys and the privilege of
lawyel,7s in. this state to re:plain self-regulating,
I

.

7. An order calling for discipline short of a .suspension of Miyashita' s
law license with appropriate conditions precedent for reinstatement would not
sufficiyntly protect the public for the following reasons:

5

,;

.

I

a. Miyashita engaged in multipl~ violations of the Revised Rules of
Professional Conduct over a lengthy period of time, as opposed to an
isolated act or mistake, and it therefore appears that her rtlisconduct is the
result of some problem or personality defect that is not readily changeable.

I

b. Miyashita failed tdprovide any assurances that she has addressed
whatever problem or character flaw cau~edher misconduct and therefore
there i$ a substantial risk that her misconduct would be repeated if she is
permitted to continue to practice law.
'
c. Entry of an order imposing lesser discipline would fail to acknowledge
the seriousness of t4e offenses which ,Miyashita committed, wO'!lld be'
inconsistent with 'Orders ~f discipline entered'by this bodY'in similar cases
and would send the wrong message to attorneys regarding the conduct
.
expected of members of the Bar in this State.
d. The protectiQn of the public requires that Miyasmta not be pennitted to
resume the practice of law until she demonstrates that she understands her
ethical obligations to her clients, and demonstrates that she is p.ot suffering
from any addictiqn or ,mental illness or condition that prevents her :from
practicing law compet(intly.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and
Findings of Fact Relevant to Discipline, the Ilearing Committee 4ereby enters the
following:
ORDER OFDISCIPLINE
1. The Defendant~ Catolyn E. Miyashita, is hereby disbarred

I

2. The Defendant shall pay the costs in this matter within 30 days of
