CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.
All parties m'e properly before the Hearing Panel and the DHC has jurisdiction over
Defendant, Meredith p, Ezzell, and over the subject matter of this proceeding.
2.
Defendant's conduct, as set out in the stipulated Findings of Fact above, constitutes
grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 84-28(b)(2) in that Defendant violated the
Rules of Professional Conduct as follows:
a) By failing to provide lR. the legal services for which she was retained, Defendant
failed to act with diligence in violation of Rule 1.3;

NCSB v. Ezzell, 18 DHC 42
Consent Order of Discipline
Page 3 of 11

b) By failing to respond to J .R. 's phone calls and requests for information about her case,
Defendant failed to communicate with her client in violation of Rule 1.4(a) and Rule
1A(b);
c) By collecting fees from J.R. for legal services she did not provide, Defendant collected
illegal or excessive fees in violation of Rule 1.5(a);
d) By failing to refund unearned fees and failing to communicate with lR. upon
termination of the representation, Defendant failed to take steps to protect her client's
interests upon termination in violation of Rule 1.16(d);
e) By claiming to clients via her website that she would provide them with legal
representation and personally attend to their cases during a time when she knew she
was not attending to her cases or even going into her law office, Defendant
misrepresented the services she would provide in violation of Rule 7.l(a);
f) By failing to appear in cOUli on behalf of S.H., Defendant engaged in activity that was
prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8A(d);
g) By allowing her nonlawyer paralegal to provide legal services to lR., Defendant failed
to take reasonable measures to ensure that a nonlawyer assistant acted in accordance
with the professional obligations of the profession and aided another in the
unauthorized practice of law, a criminal act that reflects adversely on a lawyer's
professional fitness in violation of Rule 5.3(b), Rule 5.5(f) and Rule 8A(b); and
h) By failing to conduct monthly and quarterly reconciliations, review banlc statements
and cancelled checks, and complete or sign transaction reviews, Defendant violated
Rule 1.15-3(d), Rule 1.15-3(i)(l), and Rule 1.15-3(i)(2).
Based upon the consent of the pmiies, the Hearing Panel also finds by clear, cogent, and

6.
In August of 2018, the Bankruptcy Court, after finding that Defendant had
sufficiently recovered from her chug-abuse issues so as to no longer be a danger to her clients,
entered an order reinstating Defendant's CMlECF filing privileges and permitting Defendant to
represent clients in the U.S. Bankmptcy Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, subject
to certain terms and conditions.
7.
Defendant has agreed to repay her client, lR., $1,427.00 for unearned and excessive
attorney's fees.
8.
The Hearing Panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of discipline
available to it, including admonition, reprimand, censure, suspension, and disbarment, in
determining the appropriate discipline to impose in this case.
Based upon the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Additional Findings of Fact
Regarding Discipline, and with the consent of the parties, the Hearing Panel also enters the
following:
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING DISCIPLINE

1.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code IB.0116(f)(I) of the Discipline and Disability Rules of the North Carolina State Bar and
concludes that the following factors that warrant suspension or disbarment are present:
(a) Elevation of Defendant's own interest above that of the client;
(b) Negative impact of Defendant's actions on the administration of justiCe; and
(c) Impairment of the client's ability to achieve the goals of the representation.
2.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code IB.0116(f)(2) of the Discipline and Disability Rules of the North Carolina State Bar and
concludes that no factors are present that would warrant disbarment.
3.
The Hearing Panel has considered all of the factors enumerated in 27 N.C. Admin.
Code IB.0116(f)(3) of the Discipline and Disability Rules of the North Carolina State Bar and
concludes the following factors are applicable in this matter:
(a) A pattern of misconduct;
(b) Interim rehabilitation;
(c) Defendant's full and free disclosure to the Hearing Panel and cooperative attitude
toward the proceedings; and
(d) Imposition of other penalties or sanctions.
4.
The Hearing Panel has considered issuing an admonition, reprimand or censure but
concludes that such discipline would not be sufficient. The Hearing Panel concludes that such
discipline would fail to ac1mowledge the seriousness of the violations committed by Defendant
and would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public regarding the conduct expected of
members of the Bar in this State.

5.
The Hearing Panel has considered all alternatives and concludes that a suspension is
necessaty to adequately protect the pUblic. The Hearing Panel finds that an order imposing
discipline shOtt of suspension would not be appropriate.

Fact Regarding Discipline and Conclusions Regarding Discipline, and based upon the consent of
