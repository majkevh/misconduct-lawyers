FINDINGS OF FACT,
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
AND ORDER OF DISCIPLINE

THIS MATTER came on to be heard and was heard on March 12 - 13, 1998
before a hearing committee of the Disciplinary Hearing Commission composed of
Richard T. Gammon, Chair; Vernon Russell and Robert Franz. The Defendant, Marquis
'Street, was represented by Richard Gabriel and Robert Wells. The N.C. State Bar was
represented by Carolin Bakewell. Based upon the evidence introduced at the hearing,
the pretrial stipulations and the pleadings herein, the Committee makes the following:
FINDINGS OF FACT
1. The Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar, is a body duly organized under the
laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this proceeding under the
,authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, and the
Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina State Bar promulgated thereurtder.
2. The Defendant, Marquis D. Street, (hereafter, Street) was admitted to the North
Carolina State Bar in 1972, and is, and was at all times referred to herein, an attorney at
law licensed to practice in North Carolina, subject to the rules, regulations and Rules of
Professional Conduct of the North Carolina State Bar and the laws of the State of North
Carolina.
;Q

i!I;

3. During all of the relevant periods referred to herein, Street Was actively

4. Street was properly served with process and the heating herein was held with
due notice to all parties.
5. Andrew L. Yarborough IV (hereafter, Yarborough) clied unexpectedly on May
28, 1990. Prior to his death, Yarborough was engaged in the practice oflaw in the City
of :High Point.
6. Yarborough devoted his practice exclusively to perso~al injury matters. At
the time of his death, he had at least 119 active client files pending. These files
(hereafter, Y arborou~h files), were in different stages of completion. For instance, in
approximately six cases, settlements had been reached prior to Yarborough's de~th, but
the settlement checks had not yet arrived. In other cases, Yarbprough had done
substantial work prior to his death and in others, little work had been d<?ne.

I

7 . Yarborough was survived, inter alia, by his mother, Pency Yarborough
(hereafter, Ms. Yarborough) and ~s estranged wife, Joan Yarborough.,
8., Yarborough. had an "of counsel" relationship with Johnny Landon (hereafter,
Landon), a boyhood friend and neighbor who, at the time relev@t to, these proceedings,
taught at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and was licensed only in the state of
North Dakota.

9. Prior to Yarborough's death, Landon and Yarborough occasionally worked on
cases in federal court together. Shortly before Yarborough's death, Landon and Street
worked with Yarborough on a proceeding in Randolph County. Landon was admitted
pro hac vice in this proceeding and Street knew that Landon was not licensed to practice
law in North Carolina.
10. Although they occasionally worked together on cases, Landon and
Yarborough were not law partners and did not routinely share fees. Landon did not pay
any portion of the costs of running Yarborough's law office in High,Point.

I

11. Immediately after Yarborough's death, Landon offered to assist M$ ..
Yarborough in winding up her son's law practice and with the legal work associated with
probating his estate. Very shortly after Yarborough's death, Landon cop.tacted Street,
who had also kn:own Yarborollgh for .some time prior to his death.
12. By early June 1990, Street had undertaken to provide legal advice and
services to Yarborough's estate and to Ms. Yarborough in her representative capacity
administratrix of the estate. He had also undertaken t9 wind down Yarborough's law r~
practice by completing the legal work on a number of personal injury files which were
pending in Yarborough's office at the time of his death.

I

13. Ms. Yarborough knew of and consented to Street's involvement as attorney
for her son's estate and the attorney handling the wind up of her son's law practice. She
trusted both Street and Landon as her son's friends.
'
14. The parties did not enter into any written fee agreement respecting how
Street and Landon were to be paid for their services. Early in the relationship, however,
Landon told Ms. Yarborough that he and Street would provide legal services and advice
:to her in her capacity as administratrix of the Yarborough estate and would wind down
Yarborough; s law practice at no charge. Street, who was present during the entire
conversation, did not contradict Landon, nor did he indicate that he intended to bill Ms.
Yarborough or the estate for his services. Despite this conversation, however, Ms.
Yarborough expected to pay some !easonable amount to Street and Landon for their
work.

:;1-_-_

,

15. On June 6, 1990, Street filed a petition to have Ms. Yarborough named
;collector of Yarborough's estate. She was later named administratrix ,of the estate and
,served in that capacity until Februciry 1991 when she was removed and Kenneth Babb
'(hereafter Babb), was appointed administrator dbn of Yarborough's estate.

I

16. Street did not provide significant legal services to the Yarborough estate after
June 1990.
17. Between early June and approximately Oct. 8, 1990, Yarborough's law
,
: office in High Point (hereafter, High Point office), remained open and at least so;me of
i Yarborough's former employees continued to work on the pending Yarborough files.
18. Between early June and Oct. 8, 1990, approximately 10 new personal injury
, files were opened through the High Point office and some work was also done on these
; matters by Yarborough's former employees.
,
19: At various times between early June and Oct. 8, 1990, Street visited the High
, Point office and assisted in the resolution of the Yarborough files. -

1-

20. As the Yarborough files were settled, it was necessary to disburse the
settlement funds and attorneys fees generated by the settlements. It was also necessary to
• pay the variOlis.expenses associated with the continued operation of Yarborough's law
; office.
I

21. In late June 1990, Street opened four bank accounts. One of these was an :q
operating account at Southern National Bank which Street opened in the name of Andf~w
: L Yarborough IV. This account, which was assigned account number 351-513608, ~as
used as an operating or business account during the wind down of Yarborough's practice
, (hereafter, SNB 3608 operating account).

22. Shortly after opening the SNB 3608 operating account, Stre~t closed
Yarborough':;; old 'operating account at Central Carolina Bank and transferred all of the
funds remaining in that account, $3,820.52, into the SNB 3608 operat~g account.
23. The $3,820.52 which was transferred from Yarborough~s old operating
account into the new SNB 3608 operating account represented funds which were the
property of Yarborough. These funds were later COminingled with other funds in the
3608 operating account and were disbursed for various purposes. No portion of the
$3,820.52 was disbursed directly to the Yarborough estate, however.

I

24. Ms. Yarborough did not know of or consent to the transfer of the $3,820.52
from Yarborough's CCB operating account into the SNB 3608 operating account.
25. Also in late June 1990, Street opened another operatingaccoUllt in the name
of Street & Landpn law offices at First Union National Bank (hereafter Street & Landon
operating account). A total of$1,250, which represented a fee generated by the
settlement of one of Yarborough's client's files, was deposited into the Street & Landon
operating account on June 29, 1990. There was virtually rio other activity in this ,
account, however, and the balance in the account was later transferred into the SNB 3608
operating account.
26. On June 26, 1990, Street opened a trust account atSouthem National aank in
the name of Andrew L. Yarborough IV and clients. This account, which was assigned
account number 351-54147, was used as a depository for clierit and fiduciary funds
during the wiIid down ofYarborough"s law practice (hereafter SNB 4147 trust account).
27. Shortly after the SNB 4147 trust account was opened, Street closed
Yarborough's old trust account at Central Carolina Bank (hereafter, CCB trust account)
and transferred the balance in that account, totaling $25,578.02, into the SNB 4147 trust
account.

I

28. A total of$Hi,080.82 of the $25,578.02 transferred from the CCB trust
account int() the SNB 4147 trust account represented funds belonging to clients of
Yarborough. The remaining $9,497.20 represented fees which had be~n eame4 by
Yarborough befpre his death.
29. A total of$8,598.03 of the $9,497.20 in earned fees which had originated
from Yarborough's CCB trust account were ultimately transferred from the SNB 4147
account to the Y~borough estate., The ~emaiIiing $899: 17 in fees were trW?sferre~ to ~e
SNB 3608 operatmg account and were disbursed for vanous purposes assPclat~d Wlth ~
operating the High Point office.
"
30. Street did not advise Ms. Yarborough that a total of $9,497.20 in earned fees
which were the property of the Yarborough estate had been transferred into the SNB 4147

account, nor did she consent to the use of $899.17 of these funds by Street and Landon
for the operation of the High Point office.
31. On June 27, 1990, Street opened a trust account at First Union National Bank.
'The account, which was assigned number 7208792854 (hereafter FU 2854 trust account),
,was primarily used as a depository for funds generated by settlement of the pending
·Yarborough cases after Yarborough's death.
32. Between approximately June 26, 1990 and Oct. 8, 1990, Street settled at least
'39 cases for former clients of Yarborough. Gross settlement proceeds from these 39
'cases were deposited into the SNB 4147 trust account and the FU 2854 trust account.

I'-".

33. Between July 12, 1990 and Oct. 8, 1990, funds totaling $56,666.45 were
:transferred from the FU 2854 trust account to the SNB 3608 operating' account.
34. The $56,666.45 constituted approximately one-third ofthe gross settlement
funds received relative to Yarborough files after his death. A total of$30,191.06 of
.these funds were·disbursed by Street to pay expenses of operating Yarborough's High
,Point office after his death, including payroll and utilities.
35. Between July 30, 1990 and Oct. 4, 1990, Street paid Landon a total of
1$16,838.02 by issuing six checks to Landon which were drawn on the SNB 3608
,operating account.
36. On the same dates, Street also paid himself a total of$16,838.02 by h;suing
,himself six checks drawn on the SNB 3608 operating account.
37. The funds which Street paid to himself and Landon represented a portion of
:the fees generated by settlement of Yarborough cases after Yarborough's death.
38. Ms. Yarborough did not know of or consent to the payment of the $16,838.02
to Street nor did she know of or consent to the payment of the $16,838.02 to Landon.

I'

39. At the time during which Street disbursed $16,838.02 to himself and the
identical amount to Landon, no sums had been disbursed to Yarborough's estate.
4D. Yarborough and his staff had performed at least some services for each ofthe
39 clients whose cases were settled through the High Point office prior to Oct. 8, 1990.
Moreover, each of the files had been generated through Yarborough's office and the f~
~~
estate was, in effect, paying all of the costs of operating the office after Yarborough' s ;~
death. Consequently, YarboroUgh's estate was entitled to at least some portion of the
legal fees generated by the settlement of the cases.

41. Street maintained exclusive control of the checkbook and records relating to
the SNB 3608 operating accoUnt, Street & Landon operating account, SNB 4147 trust
account and FUNB 2854 trust account.
42. Street did not account to Ms. Yaiborough respecting the Yarborough files
which he settled through the High Point office, nor did he summari~e for her which files
had been settled, the amount of the settlements obtained, amount of attorneys fees
generated by each case or the way in which the settlement funds were disbursed.

I

43. By Oct. 8, 1990, Street and Landon terminated their relationship. In a letter
dated Oct. 8,1 990, Street notified Ms. Yarborough that he was resigning as, attorney for
the estate of Andrew L. Yarboroug~ IV and that he was also resigning as attorney
responsible for willding up Yarborough's law practice.
44. With his resignation letter of Oct. 8, 1990, Street submitted a bill to Ms.
Yarborough, claiming that he was owed $14,835 for legal services which.he had provided
to the Yarborough estate and claiming that he was owed another $19,704.23 for work he
had done in winding up Yarborough's law practice.
45. Street did not disclose in the Oct. 8, 1990 letter that he had already paid
himself' and Landon $16,838.02 each in fees generated by Yarborough's files. Street also
did not disclose how he had computed the amounts which he claim~d he was owed, nor
did he submit ~y time records which he contended supported his claims.
. 46. Ms. Yarborough did not pay any fees to Street as a result of his letter of Oct.
8, 1990 arid, at the time the demand was made,the estate lacked assets with which to
make such a payment.
47. Although Street told Ms, Yarborough that he was no longer responsible for
winding down Yarborough's practice, Street took possession of 51 Yarborough files,
without Ms. Yarborough's knowledge and consent.

I

48. After Oct. 8, 1990, Street continued to work on these remaining 51
Yarborough files through his own office in Greensboro.
49. As t~e 51 Yarborough cases were settled, Street depo:;ited the settlement
proceeds into his attorney trust account at First Union National Bank, account number
7208780600 (hereafter St.reet FU 600 trust account) without the knowledge and consent
oiMs. Yarborough.
~.
~

.

50. Between Nov. 16, 1990 and July 1992, Street disbursed to himself a total ot
$94,131.13 which represented legal fees generated from the 51 Yarborough files which
he took to Greensboro. The 21 files which were specifically identified in the State Bar's
complaint in this matter generated $34,938.28 in attorneys fees. Ms .. Yarborough did not

6

/
I

..
i

/'

know of or consent to the disbursements of these fees to Street. Street did not hold any
portion of these attorneys fees in trust or in escrow.
51. Meanwhile, in late October 1990, Street had an employee deliver to Landon a
box which contained at least some of the bank records relating to the SNB 4147 trust
account, the FUNB 2854 trust account and the FUNB 3608 operating account. The box
did not contain an accounting of the Yarborough files which Street had ,settled. The box
was first delivered to Ms. Yarborough's house where it remained for a day or two before
Landon picked it 'up. Ms. Yarborough did not look in the box and did not know what it
contained.
52. Street failed to render accountings at least annually to Ms. Yarborough and/or
the estate of Andrew Yarborough IV respecting funds which he had collected from
'Yarborough's former clients, nor did he notify Ms. Yarborough or the estate of Andrew
Yarborough of the receipt of funds generated by settlement of files of Yarborough's
former clients.
53. In the fall of 1990, after Street had announced that he had resigned as attorney
for the Yarborough estate and as the attorney responsible for winding down Yarborough's
practice, another attorney, Bonnie Crawford, undertook to settle the pending Yatborough
caSes which remained in the High Point office.
54. Ms. Yarborough and Ms. Crawford signed a Written agreement, whereby Ms.
Crawford was to remit to the Yarborough estate a total of 1/3 of the attorneys' fees
generated by the Yarborough cases which she settled. The remaining 2/3 of the attorneys
fees were to be retained by Ms. Crawford as her fee and to pay for office expenses
'~sociated with settling the Yarborough cases.
55. Ms. Crawford ultimately was able to settle six Yarborough cases. She
relayed one-third of the attorneys' fees generated by these cases to Babb for the benefit of
the Yarborough estate, along with an accounting, upon his request.
56. In late 1990, Ms. Yarborough contacted another attorney, Billy Friende, to
seek his assistance in obtaining some information concerning what had happened to the
Yarborough files and the settlement funds received by Street.
57. In mid-December 1990, Ms. Yarborough and Friende visited Street at Street's
office in Greensboro. As a result of this meeting, Street gave Ms. Yarborough three
Ii
checks which totaled $7,348.36. One ofthe checks, in the amount of $4;245.03,
represented the remaining earned attorney fees which had been left in the FUNB 2854 ~
flccount. The remaining two checks constituted about 40% of the attorneys fees
r
generated When Street settled three Yarborough cases after Oct. 8, 1990.
58, During the meeting in mid-December 1990, Street told Ms. Yarborough that
he had an agreement with Landon whereby he was to be paid $250 an hour for his work
7

r

003Sl;

in winding down Yarborough's law office and in serving as attorney for the estate. He
indicated that he was also to be paid 25 cents per mile for travel incurred in serving in
these two capacities.
59. Ms. Yarborough never agreed to pay Street $250 an hour for work as the
attorney for her son's estate or the attorney handling the wind down of her son's law
practice. The first time she had heard of any such arrangement was at the meeting iii
Street's office,in mid-December 1990.
.'

I

60: Street did not turn Qver any records or documents supporting his. claim that he
was entitled to be paid $250 an hour for his services. He did produce, dUring his
deposition by the State Bar in Al,1gust 1997, notes which he indicated were his time
records for services performed for the estate and in his capacity as attorn.ey handling the
wind down of Yarborough's law practic~. These notes were not produced in Streef s .
response to the Grievance Comtnittee in this matter, nor were they produced in his
response to the State Bar' s initia~ discovery requests.
61. The notes which Street identified as time records indicated that he spent
approximately 34 hours working on YarborOligh's estate. Even if Street was to be paid
$250 an hour for such work, which the Committee does not find was the case, Street's
own tim~ records did not justify his demand for payment of$14,835 for legal services to
the estat~.
62. Other than the $7,348.36 which Street turned over to Ms. Yarborough asa
result of the meetip,g in mid-December, 1990, Street never turned over any other sums
generated by settlement of Yarborough files to Ms. Yarborough or to Babb as the
personal representative of the Yarborough estate or to any other persoil for the benefit of
the Yarborough estate.

I

63. In June 1991, Babb sent Street a letter requesting him to account for the
YarbQrough files which he had settled and the funds derived from those settlements.
64. Street did not respond directly to this letter or to a follow up letter which
Babb sent to him in September 1991.
65. In.May 1992, Babb sought and obtained an order from the Clerk of Forsyth
County Superior Court, directing Street to appear before the Clerk and account for the
Yarborough files and the funds derived from those settlements.

m

66. Street appeared at the hearing before the Forsyth County Clerk on June ~J
1992 with his attorney, Richard Gabriel. Street did not produce any accountings or client
files or settlement funds at the hearing.
67. On July 9,1992, Street, through his attorney, provided to Babb a list of 42
YarborQugh files which he had taken to Greensboro. The list omitted the names·of9
8

----------------~~--------~---~-~~---------

other Yarborough files which Street had taken to Greensboro. Attached to the partial list
Were settlement sheets setting out how the settlement funds in 25 of the cases on the list
had been disbursed. No settlement sheets were provided for the remaining cases. Street
offered to assist Babb in obtaining copies of the records relating to the High Point trust
a:ccounts and operating accounts which Street had opened but did not provide copi~s of
apy bank records.
,
. 68. Street did not produce the actual client files relating to the Yarborough cases
which he had taken to Greensboro and did not produce any records relating to the Street
60 trust account.

I

. ,
.
69. The Yarborough cases pending at Yarborough's death generated a: total of
$:158,585 in attorneys fees. The Yarborough cases settled by Street generated a total of
$:143,833.06 in attorneys fees. If one-third of those fees had been paid to the
Yarborough estate, the estate's share of the fees would be $47,896.41.

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the hearing committee enters the
following:

FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING DISCIPLINE
1. It is reasonable to require Street to pay restitution to the Yarborough estate in
the amount of $40,000, which represents 113 of the attorneys' fees generated by the
Yarborough cases which.he settled, minus the $7348 which he paid to the estate in
Oecember 1990.

2. The defendant's misconduct is aggravated by the following factors:
a) substantial prior experience in the practice of law;
b) mUltiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct;

I

c) prior disciplinary offenses.
3. The defendant's misconduct is mitigated by the following factors:
a) cooperative attitude and full disclosure to the hearing committee in this
matter;
b) remoteness of the offenses;
c) the defendant successfully represented the former clients of Andrew
Yarborough and properly handled the settlement funds deposited into
his trust account, except as set out herein.

4. The mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating factors.
Based upon the foregoing aggravating and mitigating factors and the arguments of
t4e parties, the hearing coqunittee hereby enters the following:
