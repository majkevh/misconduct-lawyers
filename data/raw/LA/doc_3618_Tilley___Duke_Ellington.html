  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: DUKE ELLINGTON TILLEY, JR.</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 00-DB-013</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a Joint Petition for Consent Discipline
  by Duke Ellington Tilley, Jr., (herein "Respondent") of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and the Office of Disciplinary
  Counsel (herein "ODC").</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Formal charges were filed against the Respondent on February 3, 2000, alleging violations of
  Rules of Professional Conduct <span class="allegedrules">1.5(f)(6)</span> (failure to promptly return an unearned
  fee), <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate
  with ODC). On March 2, 2000, the Respondent filed a response to the formal charges, stating that he earned the fee at
  issue but that he had returned a portion of the fee as a goodwill gesture. He further submitted that financial
  problems initially prevented the timely return of the fee.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">A hearing before Hearing Committee Number 1 was set for May 5, 2000, but later continued at the
  request of the hearing committee chair. Prior to the setting of another hearing date, a Joint Petition for Consent
  Discipline was filed by the parties on May 4, 2000. In the consent discipline pleadings, the parties suggest that a
  public reprimand is the appropriate sanction.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On June 29, 2000, a panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter. Deputy Disciplinary
  Counsel Mimi T. Nguyen represented the ODC. The Respondent did not appear.</p>

  <h3>THE JOINT PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The stipulated facts submitted by the parties in connection with the Joint Petition for Consent
  Discipline reveal the following information. Booker and Alice Cage retained the Respondent on April 2, 1997 to obtain
  custody of their grandchildren. The Respondent was paid his requested flat fee of $625.00. One year later, Mr. and
  Mrs. Cage discharged the Respondent because of his lack of progress and lack of communication. The Cages requested a
  refund of $575.00, to which the Respondent agreed in writing, and promised to provide the refund within ten days.
  However, the Respondent did not return any of the fee until February 1999, when he refunded $200.00. In March 1999,
  he refunded another $100.00, leaving a balance of $275.00, more than one year after promising to refund $575.00. The
  Respondent finally paid the balance of $275.00 in February 2000. The Respondent has also admitted that during the
  course of its investigation, the ODC had to issue a subpoena for his sworn statement because of his failure to
  cooperate with the disciplinary process.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Respondent agrees that his misconduct resulted in violations of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct as charged. The parties also agree that Respondent's prior disciplinary record, a 1998 admonition for
  violation of Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3, 8.1(c), and 8.4(g), is an aggravating factor. Mitigating factors
  include restitution. As noted above, a public reprimand is the proposed sanction.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the
    profession;</p>

    <p>(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p>(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p>(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Board finds that the Respondent has violated his duties owed to his clients, Mr. and Mrs.
  Cage, as well as duties owed to the profession. The Respondent's actions in this matter were negligent. Further, the
  Board finds that the Respondent's failure to promptly return the unearned fee caused actual injury to Mr. and Mrs.
  Cage in that they were deprived of these funds for a significant period of time. Respondent's failure to cooperate
  with the ODC caused actual injury by unnecessarily delaying the disciplinary process.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In reviewing the Petition, the Board finds the mitigating factor of restitution and the
  aggravating factor of prior disciplinary action are supported by the record.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The proposed sanction is in line with the A.B.A. guidelines and case law. Under A.B.A. Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.13</span>, a "reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent in dealing
  with client property and causes injury or potential injury to a client." The comments to the standard notes that "the
  courts have typically imposed reprimands in cases when lawyers . . . neglect to return the client's property
  promptly." The Respondent explains in his response to the formal charges that he failed to promptly return the fee
  because of financial problems due to relocation of office, a downturn in business, and personal problems. It appears
  that although he acknowledged that he owed the Cages the fee, he did not have the money to promptly return the fee.
  Ultimately, he did return the amount agreed to by the parties, $575.00.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC cites <span class="cite"><i>In re: Mouton</i>,
  <a href="../SC/1992-10-30_1991-2938.htm">610 So. 2d 787</a> (La. 1992)</span>, in support of its argument that a
  public reprimand is appropriate here. In <u>Mouton</u>, the Court approved the Board's recommendation that the
  attorney receive a public reprimand for not returning the unearned portion of a fee that had been paid in advance.
  Although few facts are provided in the <u>Mouton</u> opinion, it appears that Mouton failed to return the fees of two
  clients; the fees totaled $3,125.00. <u>Id</u>. No mitigating or aggravating factors were noted.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Other cases that deal with the failure to return an unearned fee and to cooperate with the ODC
  involved more stringent sanctions. However, more aggravating factors were present or allegations of neglect also were
  involved. <u>See</u> <span class="cite"><i>In re: Colwart</i>, <a href="../SC/1998-11-16_1998-2303.htm">721 So. 2d
  848</a> (La. 1998)</span>(attorney was paid $1,000, did little work on client's behalf, failed to communicate with
  client, failed to return unearned fee, and failed to cooperate with ODC; numerous aggravating factors present and six
  month suspension imposed); <span class="cite"><i>In re: Rudman</i>, <a href="../SC/1999-06-25_1999-1037.htm">738 So.
  2d 537</a> (La. 1999)</span> (attorney suspended for one year based on his neglect of two clients' cases and failure
  to return unearned fee to one of the clients; numerous aggravating factors were present).</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the petition for consent discipline be accepted, and
  that a public reprimand be issued against the Respondent for his violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. It
  is further ordered that the Respondent be assessed the costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest
  to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this Ruling until paid.</p>
