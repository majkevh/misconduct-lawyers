  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: Winfield E. Little, Jr.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">DISCIPLINARY BOARD RULING</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On January 24, 1994, a complaint was filed with the office of Disciplinary Counsel alleging that
  respondent charged a fee exceeding the percentages set forth in the Louisiana Workers' Compensation provisions.  The
  complainant appealed a dismissal of the charge by Disciplinary Counsel, and a panel of the Disciplinary Board
  remanded the matter to Disciplinary Counsel for the filing of formal charges.  Formal charges were filed on March 24,
  1995, and a hearing was held before <span class="cite"><a href="../HC/1995-08-24_95-DB-009.htm">Hearing Committee No.
  5</a></span> on July 12, 1995. Hearing Committee No. 5 issued its findings and recommendation on August 23, 1995, and
  this matter was argued before the Disciplinary Board on October 19, 1995.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The thoroughly considered and well-written findings and recommendations of Hearing Committee No.
  5 are approved and hereby form the basis for the Disciplinary Board's ruling of a public reprimand for respondent. 
  Mr. Little contractually agreed with his client to obtain a contingent fee on part of a recovery from a work related
  accident and a workers' compensation statutory fee for the remaining part of any recovery.  It is undisputed that
  respondent obtained an outstanding result for his client, but in doing so he retained a fee in excess of the
  statutory boundaries set forth in La.  R.S. 23:1141(B).  It is clear that respondent violated Rule
  <span class="Rules">1.5(c)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  He accepted a contingent fee in a workers'
  compensation case which exceeded the percentages set forth in the statute and therefore was prohibited by law.  The
  Hearing Committee weighed the aggravating and mitigating factors, referred to the ABA Standard For Imposing Lawyer
  Sanctions (1996) and the Louisiana cases and concluded that the appropriate sanction for respondent was a public
  reprimand.  Respondent remained recalcitrant throughout the hearing denying that he had done anything wrong and that
  the fee arrangement was customary in his region of the state.  The Disciplinary Board affirms the Hearing Committee
  recommendation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">There is an ongoing dispute whether or not respondent has repaid his client, Kenneth McKinney,
  all of the fees that he withheld, plus interest and costs.  A civil suit was filed by the client and reached the
  Louisiana 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, and that litigation is in the final stages of enforcement and collection. 
  Respondent has repaid his client the vast majority of the fees and costs, and the remaining amount allegedly due
  consists largely of interest for the period of time respondent held the excessive fees and costs.  The matter of
  resolving any remaining fees and costs due is best left to the civil lawsuit since inadequate evidence was presented
  to the Hearing Committee and the Disciplinary Board to include any amounts due in a recommended sanction.  McKinney
  can be made whole through the usual civil proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">For the reasons set forth herein, the Disciplinary Board publically reprimands respondent and
  assesses all costs of these proceedings unto him.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This ruling approved this 29th day of January, 1996.</p>

    <p class="headingstyle">DISSENT  </p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">The respondent, an attorney with 20 years experience including a knowledge and understanding of
    "workers' compensation cases", clearly charged a fee to his client which was in excess of that permitted by the
    Workers' Compensation Statute.  The Hearing Committee opinion and its findings of fact make clear that the
    respondent did not disclose to his client that the fee that he had charged was in excess of that permitted by
    statute.  Not until the client retained other counsel for other unrelated matters did the excessive fee collected
    by the respondent come to light.  The respondent did not willingly or readily refund the excessive fee until after
    being forced to do so by a ruling of the Workers' Compensation Judge and, later by the Third Circuit Court of
    Appeal.  Indeed, at this writing, there yet remains pending unresolved civil litigation between the client and the
    respondent regarding whether or not a full accounting has 'the fact been provided.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">The record further makes clear that the respondent has refused to acknowledge the wrongful
    nature of his conduct.  The respondent continues to assert that he had done nothing wrong his charging this fee
    though there is  no explanation contained in the record for this unfounded assertion.  The charging of an excessive
    fee which flies directly in the face of the statutory prohibition against such conduct demonstrates at least a
    selfish motive if not one which could be characterized as dishonest.  Certainly, the victim of a disabling
    condition such as that of the client in this instance reflects a vulnerable victim (albeit one under the facts of
    this case whose underlying personal Injury claim may have been tainted by a pre-existing condition).  These factors
    coupled with the respondent's substantial experience in the practice of law would dictate a more substantial
    discipline than a mere public reprimand.  Indeed, in light of the nature of the respondent's misconduct, I would
    disagree that a baseline sanction would be a public reprimand.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">The Hearing Committee and majority opinion, in my judgment, may have placed undue emphasis upon
    the admittedly excellent recovery which the respondent engineered on behalf of his client.  Additionally, excessive
    emphasis may have been placed upon the discovery of the client's preexisting medical condition which, it is
    assumed, was allegedly caused by the accident giving rise to the litigation as opposed to perhaps aggravated. 
    Neither of these factors, in my judgment, are proper considerations for the assessment of discipline against the
    respondent.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">In a case featuring some similarities, the Supreme Court in the matter of
    <span class="cite">William Earl Harrison, <a href="../SC/1995-01-27_1994-2800.htm">648 So.2d 1323</a> (La.
    1995)</span> imposed discipline against the respondent who charged a fee in excess of that permitted by the
    statutory guidelines of the Social Security Administration.  Unlike the respondent in this instance, Harrison
    professed ignorance as to the Social Security Administration statutory limits and his assertions were found
    credible by both the Hearing Committee and the Board.  While Harrison was unable to fully refund the money
    immediately because of domestic and other financial set backs, prior to the issuance of final discipline in the
    matter Harrison had fully refunded the amount of the excess fee plus interest and had served 30 eight hour days of
    community service.  In that case, the Court approved the Board's recommendation of a three month suspension
    deferred, placing the respondent on 12 months unsupervised probation with certain conditions including the
    completion of 30 eight hour days of community service within a six month period, prompt and timely payment of all
    bar dues and disciplinary assessments, and compliance with mandatory continuing legal education requirements and
    other similar requirements.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">By contrast, in this instance, the evidence of record does not reflect that the respondent was
    unmindful of the statutory prohibition contained in the Louisiana Workers' Compensation Law and certainly does not
    reflect the respondent's remorse for his own misconduct.  Under the circumstances here presented, it is difficult
    to understand why a sanction at least more onerous than that imposed upon Harrison would not be required here.  At
    the very least, that discipline which has been imposed upon the respondent in Harrison should be considered
    appropriate in this instance.  Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent.</p>
