  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 98-DB-057</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of formal charges by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel against Calvin J. Laiche of Kentwood, Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Formal charges, consisting of five counts, were filed against Respondent on August 10, 1998.
  Respondent filed his answer on September 23, 1 998, in which he admitted to representing the Complainants, but denied
  the misconduct. On February 18, I 999, a joint motion for consent discipline was filed by Respondent and the Office
  of Disciplinary Counsel. Respondent seeks a public reprimand for his misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter on April 29, 1999. The Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel was represented by Deputy Counsel James T. Daly; Respondent, however, did not appear.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Count I alleges that the Office of Disciplinary Counsel received a complaint from Rhonda and
  Farrell Boudreaux, indicating that they had hired Respondent in May, 1989, to represent them and their minor son in a
  personal injury matter. Respondent filed suit, but did little more to move the case forward over the next eight
  years, in violation of Rule <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Count II alleges that Respondent failed to keep his clients informed as to the progress or lack
  of progress of the case, in violation of Rule <span class="allegedrules">1.4(a)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Count III alleges that Respondent failed to timely inform his clients of receipt of a settlement
  offer, which he rejected without consulting his clients, in violation of Rule
  <span class="allegedrules">1.4(b)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Count IV alleges that once Respondent was discharged by his clients, he did not hand over their
  file until two months after he was requested to do so and then failed and refused to sign a motion to substitute
  counsel for three more months, in violation of Rule <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Count V alleges that Respondent failed to respond to the complaint filed against him after being
  notified by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. Consequently, a subpoena was issued to Respondent for his appearance.
  It is alleged that his conduct violates Rules <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span>.</p>

  <h2>JOINT PETITION FOR CONSENT</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent admits to violating Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span>,
  <span class="Rules">1.4</span>, and <span class="Rules">1.6(d)</span>. The only aggravating factor is Respondent's
  substantial experience in the practice of law. The mitigating factors are the absence of a disciplinary record, no
  dishonest or selfish motive and a timely good faith effort to rectify the consequences of the misconduct. There was
  no harm to the clients as they retained new counsel and the case was successfully resolved. It is argued that a
  public reprimand is appropriate.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX §10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a finding of
  lawyer misconduct, the court or board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the
    profession;</li>

    <li>whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</li>

    <li>the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</li>

    <li>the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board finds that Respondent has violated duties owed to his clients and the legal system, has
  engaged in knowing misconduct and that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction, especially in light of the
  fact that the client did not suffer any actual harm. In consent disciplines, the Board may reject proposed discipline
  as too lenient, but when Respondent and disciplinary counsel have agreed that a violation has occurred, it may not
  reject consent discipline claiming that there was no violation. See <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Lieberman</i>,
  95-2628 (La. 6/7/96); <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So.2d 272</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board finds as the sole A.B.A. Standard §9.22 aggravating circumstances,
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>. The Board also finds the presence of
  the following A.B.A. Standard §9.32 mitigating factors: <span class="ABAstandard">no prior disciplinary
  record</span>,; <span class="ABAstandard">lack of a selfish or dishonest motive</span>;
  <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>; and <span class="ABAstandard">a timely good faith effort to rectify the
  consequences of the misconduct</span>.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, the Disciplinary Board orders that Respondent, Calvin J. Laiche, receive a public
  reprimand and further orders that Respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal
  interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality this Order until paid.</p>
