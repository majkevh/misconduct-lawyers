<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On March 10, 1994, respondent filed a petition for consent discipline wherein she requested that she be suspended from the practice of law for eighteen months retroactive to February 10, 1994, the date of the interim suspension, On that same date, disciplinary counsel filed a concurrence to the consent discipline of eighteen months. The matter was submitted directly to the disciplinary board which rejected the tendered consent discipline on May 16, 1994.

<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thereafter, on May 26, 1994, formal disciplinary charges were brought against respondent which alleged that respondent was convicted of a criminal offense which constitut[ed] serious criminal conduct involving violation of</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#800000"> </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a>(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct,<font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"> and which adversely reflect[ed] upon [respondent's] moral fitness to practice law under </font><p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Respondent filed an answer in which she admitted that she has been convicted of negligent homicide, but she denied that she lacked the moral fitness to practice law.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On August II, 1994, a hearing was held before <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Aaa4f?an=JD_HC9418 --##'>hearing committee #11. </a>The committee recommended an eighteen month suspension retroactive to the date of the interim suspension. <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A50ad?an=JD_94-DB-005 --##'> Upon review, the disciplinary board</a>, by a majority vote, recommended to this court that Brenda Brown be disbarred.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sole concern before this court in this disciplinary proceeding is the determination of the appropriate sanction.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hearing committee reviewed bar disciplinary decisions from other jurisdictions involving convictions for negligent homicide or vehicular homicide.&nbsp; These decisions suggest suspension as the appropriate sanction where there is a lack of &quot;criminal intent&quot; as an element of the crime for which the attorney has been convicted and the criminal, conduct does not reflect on the attorney's fitness to practice law.</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#008000">&nbsp; In re Morris 74 N.M. 679, 397 P.2d 475 (1964</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">)(attorney suspended for indefinite period after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter resulting from death of five persons struck by attorney while driving intoxicated);</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#008000"> In re McGrath. 98 Wash. 337, 655 P.1d 232 (1982</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"> attorney disbarred after conviction for assault in the second degree resulting from attorney intentionally shooting another person outside of a bar);</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#008000"> Disciplinary Proceedings</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"><u> </u></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#008000">Against Curran, 115 Wash. 2d 747, 801 P.2d 9052 (1990</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">)(six month. suspension given to attorney convicted of two counts of vehicular homicide resulting from driving while intoxicated).&nbsp; The hearing committee noted that, generally, an attorney is suspended for one to two years where the attorney has negligently caused the death of another while under the influence of alcohol.&nbsp; For guidance, the hearing committee also reviewed the ABA </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"><u>Standards-for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions,'Sections</u></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"> 5.11 and 5.12, which suggest disbarment when the criminal conduct includes &quot;intentional killing&quot; of another and suspension when the killing is not the result of criminal intent and the criminal conduct adversely reflects on the lawyer's fitness to practice</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the present case, the hearing committee concluded that an eighteen month suspension was appropriate-placing great emphasis on respondent's lack of criminal intent and the lack of evidence that respondent's criminal conduct adversely reflected on her fitness to practice law.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The underlying circumstances of respondent's conviction are not analogous to a conviction resulting from a death caused by an intoxicated driver.&nbsp; A gun, unlike an automobile, is an inherently dangerous weapon . </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="1"><sup>3</sup></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> When a gun is drawn against another person, intoxicated or not, the risk that someone could be seriously injured or killed is always present.&nbsp; Absent directing an automobile towards a person, an automobile does not present the same danger.&nbsp; Additionally, driving an automobile while intoxicated or in a negligent manner may evidence extremely poor judgment and reckless behavior, but it does not evidence a violent propensity.&nbsp; Absent a defect, a gun requires human volition to discharge.&nbsp; Accordingly, we find that the intoxicated driver cases reviewed by -the hearing committee offer little guidance for determining&nbsp; the appropriate sanction in the present case.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The disciplinary board found that the hearing committee's recommendation failed to adequately address the fact that respondent's criminal conduct, intentional or not, resulted in Brenda Gills' death.&nbsp; Moreover, the board criticized the hearing committee's selection of bar disciplinary decisions from other jurisdictions.&nbsp; According to the board, the cases relied on by the hearing committee addressed similar issues regarding criminal. intent, but the hearing committee failed to consider cases, with similar facts, that is, violent death through the use of a deadly weapon.&nbsp; The board reviewed bar disciplinary decisions from other jurisdictions where an attorney has caused the death of another person through the use of a deadly weapon</font></p>

<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The purpose of lawyer disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer but rather to maintain appropriate standards of professional&nbsp; conduct to safeguard the public, to perserve the intergrity of the legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the standards of the profession.</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#008000"> Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v.

<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the disciplinary hearing, disciplinary counsel introduced exhibits to support the formal charges against respondent.&nbsp; These documents included the bill of information, the minute entry noting the guilty plea, the sentencing transcript, a copy of the police report, respondent's statement to the police, the original police report, the autopsy report, the order of interim suspension, and the disciplinary board's rejection of the consent discipline.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the statement given to the police on January 3, 1993, the night of the incident, respondent said that she and the victim, Brenda Gills, lived together and had been in a relationship for four years.&nbsp; According to the respondent's statement, she and Brenda Gills had gone to a Saints game.&nbsp; Afterwards, they went to a local bar.&nbsp; Brenda Gills accused respondent of &quot;flirting with others&quot; that evening which resulted in an argument.&nbsp; Respondent and the victim returned home separately.&nbsp; When Brenda Gills arrived home she was angry with respondent and told respondent that this was the worst relationship that she had ever had.&nbsp; Respondent retreated to her bedroom and locked the door.&nbsp; Brenda Gills started &quot;bamming&quot; or &quot;banging&quot; on the door, so respondent let Brenda Gills enter.&nbsp; Respondent admitted that Brenda Gills was not threatening her in any way.&nbsp; Respondent stated that she believed that &quot;this woman [was] just going off on [her] tonight.&nbsp; However, respondent also said in her statement that she &quot;really thought that it might'd (sic) been a violent thing.&quot; Respondent stated that she picked up the gun from under the bed and &quot;it went off.&quot; Respondent denied aiming the gun.&nbsp; Respondent called 911 and informed the operator that she had just shot somebody.&nbsp; Then, respondent went outside and started screaming for neighbors to come help her.&nbsp; An emergency medical service unit transported Brenda Gills to Humana Hospital where she was pronounced dead a short time later as a result of a single gunshot wound to the right upper chest.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the narrative statement in the police report, when the officers arrived on the scene they were directed upstairs to respondent's bed room.&nbsp; The officers asked Brenda Brown about her involvement in the incident.&nbsp; In response, Brenda Brown said, I shot my lover.&quot; When asked why, Brenda Brown responded by saying &quot;We were arguing and I picked up the gun.&nbsp; The gun went off.&quot; Brenda Brown was placed under arrest.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At respondent's sentencing hearing, the trial judge stated that he had taken into consideration everything provided to him, including the facts of the case.&nbsp; After reading in open court respondent's account of the incident as transcribed in the statement given by respondent to the police on the night of the shooting, the trial court opined that the statement was at least equally consistent with manslaughter'</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="1"><sup>4</sup></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> as it was with negligent homicide and as equally consistent with a </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Passionate&quot; shooting as with negligent homicide.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the disciplinary proceeding, Brenda Brown testified on her own behalf.&nbsp; Generally, respondent's testimony provided a narrative of the facts.&nbsp; Respondent explained that the shooting was the result of stupidity and negligence.&nbsp; Respondent could not recall pulling the trigger and said that she did not intend for the gun to discharge.&nbsp; Moreover, respondent said that she did not intend to inflict any injury on Brenda Gills.&nbsp; However, respondent stated that Brenda Gills was afraid of the gun and she admitted retrieving the gun to&nbsp; convince Brenda Gills to leave the bedroom.&nbsp; At the time, Brenda Gills was unarmed and was not physically attacking respondent.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The transcript from the disciplinary proceeding reveals some inconsistencies between respondent's testimony and the statement she gave to the police on the night of the incident.&nbsp; Specifically, in her statement to the police, respondent said that she and the victim were &quot;arguing.&quot; However, during the hearing, when asked whether she and the victim were arguing respondent said, &quot;It wasn't an argument.&quot; Also, in her statement to the police, respondent portrayed Brenda Gills as the aggressor stating that Brenda Gills &quot;came towards&quot; her.&nbsp; Conversely, respondent testified at the hearing that the victim said something to the effect that &quot;this is the worst relationship I've ever been in.&nbsp; I'm getting my stufff. and leaving,&quot; which suggests a retreat.&nbsp; To some degree, these inconsistencies call into question respondent's veracity.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the hearing, respondent introduced evidence of mitigating circumstances, including her own testimony and an array of character witnesses appearing in person and through letters. </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="1"><sup>5'</sup></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">. All of these witnesses testified as to her good </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">character.&nbsp; Their views in this re gard were not affected by respondent's conviction.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First, Judge Anita Ganucheau </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="1"><sup>6</sup></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> testified that she had been acquainted with respondent for approximately twelve years.&nbsp; Judge Ganucheau met respondent when respondent was a prosecutor in Juvenile Court.&nbsp; Subsequently, they became personal friends.&nbsp; Based on her professional and personal observations of respondent, Judge Ganucheau did not believe -that respondent intentionally killed Brenda Gills.&nbsp; Judge Ganucheau testified that nothing would be gained by the profession or respondent if respondent was prohibited from practicing. law.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next, Judge Helen Ginger Berrigan, a United States District Court judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana, testified that she was a long time acquaintance of respondent's and knew her as a public Her with both the Orleans Parish and Jefferson Parish Public Defenders offices.&nbsp; Judge Berrigan was impressed with respondent as an attorney, particularly, respondent's compassion for her clients.&nbsp; According to Judge Berrigan, respondent enjoyed a good reputation in the legal community.&nbsp; Judge Berrigan's opinion regarding respondent's competency and integrity as a lawyer was unaffected by respondent's conviction.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prior to her appointment, to the federal bench, Judge Berrigan represented respondent in connection with the negligent homicide charge.&nbsp; Respondent called Judge Berrigan within a half hour of the occurrence to request her help.&nbsp; Judge Berrigan arrange d for respondent's release on bond on the condition of her self-commitment to the state hospital in Mandeville, specifically, the psychiatric unit.&nbsp; At the time, respondent was extremely distraught, remorseful, and guilt ridden and Judge Berrigan and respondent's friends and family were concerned that respondent was suicidal.&nbsp; Respondent remained committed for approximately thirty days.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Judge Berrigan hired an investigator who, within twenty four hours of the</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">shooting, interviewed patrons who had been in the lounge on the previous night and&nbsp; respondent's neighbors.&nbsp; As a result of the investigation, Judge Berrigan was convinced that this was an accidental shooting or a negligent homicide.&nbsp; Judge Berrigan found persuasive the lack of a history of any problems, respondent's distraught emotional state, respondent's prompt call to 911, and respondent's request for help from neighbors.&nbsp; Judge Berrigan provided the district attorney's office all of the information gathered during the investigation.&nbsp; The district attorney's office conducted an. independent investigation and, as a result, charged respondent with negligent hornicide.&nbsp; According to Judge Berrigan, no plea bargain was involved and respondent did not receive any favorable treatment because of her former position with the district attorney's office or the public defender's office.&nbsp; In fact, Judge Berrigan opined that the district attorney's office scrutinized the evidence closely because of respondent's prior work with the district attorney's office and public defender's office.&nbsp; Respondent pled guilty as charged without having any agreement or&nbsp; with the cowl or district attorney's office regarding the sentence.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Richard M. Thomas, Chief Indigent Defender for the 24th Judicial District Indigent Defenders Board, testified that Brenda Brown -,was a member of his staff for approximately three years.&nbsp; During her employment, respondent had a good working relationship with the other -attorneys and her performance was beyond reproach.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas did not believe that respondent's conviction was related to her ability to practice law and he said that he would rehire respondent if he had the opportunity.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Phyllis Campo, an expert clinical social worker, has counseled respondent since the shooting.&nbsp; Ms. Campo opined that respondent is truly remorseful for the death of Brenda Gills and that respondent has demonstrated an ardent desire to rectify the harm that she has caused by giving&nbsp; &quot;put back into society what she felt she had taken out.&quot; Ms. Campo believed that the shooting incident was an isolated event which was out of character for respondent.&nbsp; Ms. Campo did not know of any information which would make respondent amiable or unfit to practice law.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Denise LeBoeuf, a staff attorney with the Loyola Death Penalty Re-source Center, knew Brenda Brown from her work- with the Jefferson Parish Indigent Defender's Program.</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="4"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font><font face='Times New Roman'>Ms.</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> LeBoeuf thought that respondent was a helpful, competent attorney who was very generous with. her time.&nbsp; Ms. LeBoeuf did not know of any reason why respondent should be prohibited from practicing law.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subsequent to the conviction, respondent became employed by the United Medical Center Qf New Orleans.&nbsp; Initially, respondent was hired as a collection worker.&nbsp; However, within one year of her employment, respondent advanced into management.&nbsp; The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Business Office Director testified at the hearing.&nbsp; These three witnesses consider respondent to be an honest and hard working employee.&nbsp; Moreover, although they were aware of respondent's conviction, it did not affect their positive opinion regarding her moral turpitude.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a mitigating factor respondent also cites her lack of intent to kill the victim.&nbsp; Although Brenda Brown may </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><i>not, </i></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">have intended to kill Brenda Gills, at the very least she exercised extremely poor judgment and a violent propensity in brandishing a gun in an effort to scare someone she professed to have loved.&nbsp; Moreover, the gun, an inarfimate object, did not kill Brenda Gills.&nbsp; Brenda Brown killed Brenda Gills.&nbsp; The gun required human volition and Brenda Brown's overt action to kill.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The&nbsp; mitigating factors preserAed by respondent such as remorse, the absence of a prior disciplinary record, respondent's cooperative attitude, -and the imposition of other penalties pale in comparison to respondent's criminal conduct.&nbsp; Here, the seriousness of the consequences of respondent's conduct cannot be overstated.&nbsp; She pled guilty to negligent homicide.&nbsp; The gravity of the crime reflects heavily on respondent's fitness to practice law. We cannot overlook the fact that respondent's actions resulted in the senseless -destruction. of a life and will. obviously forever change the lives of the victim's family, particularly, the victim's minor children.&nbsp; The actual resulting injury could not have been more severe.&nbsp; Moreover, respondent demonstrated a violent reaction to an admittedly non-threatening situation.&nbsp; Her response to this apparently stressful situation creates concern regarding her continued ability to represent clients given the pressures associated with the practice of law.&nbsp; The sanction imposed must, of necessity, reasonably correspond with the gravity of the misconduct.&nbsp; Accordingly, under the circumstances of this particular case, we conclude that respondent's conviction of negligent homicide warrants disbarment.&nbsp; Any sanction less than disbarment would certainly deprecate the seriousness of the offense., Moreover, we find the presence of aggravating circumstances, specifically, respondent's motive in brandishing the gun to scare the victim and the vulnerability of the victim, a -'loved one of the respondent's who apparently felt safe in entering respondent's bedroom once respondent opened the door, support disbarment.&nbsp; Because of the gravity of the crime and the lack of mitigating circumstances relating to the crime itself, we conclude that disbarment is the appropriate discipline and that any evidence to respondent's good character can be raised if respondent applies for reinstatement a after the passage of the minimum period of time following disbarment.</font></p>

<p class='footnote'>6 In its recommendation to this court, the disciplinary board expressed concern regarding the voluntary nature of the testimony given by Judges Ganucheau and Berrigan.&nbsp; Specifically, the disciplinary board questioned whether these judges testified without&nbsp; being subpoenaed L-1 violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, .Cannon 2.- In response, respondent through. counsel, filed a motion -seeking to strike the board's&nbsp; statements expressing concern regarding possible jud cial misconduct.&nbsp; Furthermore, respondent requeseted that this matter be remanded to the board for a recommendation <font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#008000">that includes the evidence adduced through the judges' testimony. </font><font face='Times New Roman' color="#008000"> We find that nothing in the record suggests that the subpoenas were not served.&nbsp; Moreover, the record does not reveal any impropriety on the part of these judges.&nbsp; Accordingly, it is appropriate for this court to consider their testimony in determining the appropriate sanction and, consequently, we hold that it is unnecessary to remand this matter to the board.</font></p>
