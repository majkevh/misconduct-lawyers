  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-0831</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: DANIEL E. BECNEL, III</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that
  respondent neglected his clients' legal matters, failed to communicate with his clients, and failed to promptly remit
  third party funds. Following the filing of formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for
  consent discipline. Having reviewed the petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Daniel E. Becnel,
  III, Louisiana Bar Roll number 20692, be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of one year and
  one day. It is further ordered that this suspension shall be fully deferred, subject to respondent's successful
  completion of an eighteen-month period of supervised probation governed by the conditions set forth in the petition
  for consent discipline. Any violation of the conditions of probation, or any other misconduct during the probationary
  period, may be grounds for making the deferred suspension executory, or imposing additional discipline, as
  appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
