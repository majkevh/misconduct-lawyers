  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: EDWARD MARTIN FONTAINE</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 01-DB-051</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a Joint Petition for Consent Discipline
  (herein "Petition"), prior to the institution of formal charges, by Edward Martin Fontaine ("Respondent") of
  Destrehan, Louisiana, and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC"). For reasons stated below, the Disciplinary
  Board accepts the Petition and orders a public reprimand be issued against Respondent.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On May 21, 2001, ODC and Respondent filed the Petition and Stipulated Facts in this matter. ODC
  filed a Memorandum of Law. No formal charges have been filed in this matter.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On June 28, 2001, a panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter. Neither ODC nor the
  Respondent appeared or were asked to appear.</p>

  <h2>STIPULATED FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Stipulated Facts are set forth below:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1. Respondent took over the representation of the Complainant, Lawrence C. Schneider, in 1999,
    after Complainant's original attorney was suspended from practice.</p>

    <p class="inverted">2. At the time Respondent took over the matter, the petition in the personal injury suit, which
    had been filed in 1996, had not been served upon the defendant because he could not be located.</p>

    <p class="inverted">3. After a delay of several months, Respondent located the defendant and then had him served.
    Following that, defendant's insurer responded and settlement negotiations have begun.</p>

    <p class="inverted">4. However, during the time from his taking over the representation until March of 2001, there
    was no signed contingency fee contract between Respondent and his client.</p>

    <p class="inverted">5. Respondent specifically acknowledges his violations of Rules
    <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> and <span class="allegedrules">1.5(c)</span> of the Rules of Professional
    Conduct as set out in the foregoing paragraphs.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the Petition, Respondent admits to violating Rule
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span><a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" class="fn" id="_ednref1">[i]</a> and Rule
  <span class="Rules">1.5(c)</span><a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn" id="_ednref2">[ii]</a> of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct. The parties propose that a formal public reprimand be issued to Respondent.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rules 1.3 and 1.5(c) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct. The Board must accept that Respondent has violated these rules. <span class="cite"><i>In re
  Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96); <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 272</a></span>.Given the
  violations of these rules, the Board is left to determine if the proposed sanction is appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted"><![if !supportLists]>(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the
    public, to the legal system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted"><![if !supportLists]>(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted"><![if !supportLists]>(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's
    misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted"><![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![if !supportLists]>(4) the existence of any aggravating or
    mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon a review of the record, the Board finds that Respondent has negligently violated
  duties he owed to his client. The record is absent of any actual injury to the client; however, the lack of a
  contingency fee contract could have the potential injury of leaving a client unaware of how much money might be owed
  to the attorney.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The mitigating factors of <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary
  record</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">timely good faith effort to rectify the consequences of the
  misconduct</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">cooperative attitude toward these proceedings</span> are present
  here. The sole aggravating factor present is Respondent's substantial experience in the practice of
  law<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" class="fn" id="_ednref3">[iii]</a>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Finally, the proposed sanction is in keeping with the ABA <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer
  Sanctions</i> (herein "Standard") Standards. Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span> provides for reprimand
  "when a lawyer is negligent and does not act with reasonable diligence in representing a client and causes injury or
  potential injury to a client. "The cases of <span class="cite"><u>In re Laiche</u>,
  <a href="1999-07-15_98-DB-057.htm">98-DB-057</a> (Bd. Op., 7/15/99)</span> and <span class="cite"><u>In re Brown</u>,
  <a href="2000-06-13_00-DB-047.htm">00-DB-047</a> (Bd. Op., 7/31/00)</span> offer some guidance here. <u>Laiche</u>
  and <u>Brown</u> involved a Rule 1.3 violation and had the aggravating factor of
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>. Neither respondent had prior
  discipline nor were their clients actually harmed. Both of these cases were consent discipline matters that resulted
  in public reprimands. The ABA Standards and <u>Laiche</u> and <u>Brown</u> justify issuing a public reprimand in the
  instant mater.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the Petition be accepted and that a public reprimand
  be issued against the Respondent, Edward Martin Fontaine. The Board also orders the Respondent be assessed all costs
  and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of this order
  until paid.</p>
