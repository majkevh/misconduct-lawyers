NO. 94-13-1923<br>
IN RE: BURTON P. GUIDRY<br>
<br>
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS<br>
PER CURIAM*</p>
<p>***************************************************************************</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'><span class="BodyText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In September of 1986, Respondent, Burton P. Guidry, was retained by Mrs. Georgia Square to represent her son, John Square, in post conviction proceedings.&nbsp; Respondent accepted a $2,500.00 fee from the Squares.&nbsp; Mr. Guidry's efforts on behalf of his clients included a brief prison interview with John Square and a brief analysis of the court records.&nbsp; Mrs. Square attempted to contact Mr. Guidry on several occasions to ascertain whether he had made any progress but never received a response.&nbsp; Mrs. Square was therefore forced to retain an attorney to assist her in obtaining an accounting of the funds that she had advanced to Respondent and to obtain the return of any unearned fees.</span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondent was served with formal charges on March 31, 1993.&nbsp; After a formal hearing, the hearing committee determined that he had violated several disciplinary rules and rules of conduct but did not list the specific violations.&nbsp; The hearing committee recommended that Mr. Guidry be suspended from the practice of law for a period of ninety days, that he make restitution to Ms. Square, and that he be assessed with all costs.&nbsp; The disciplinary board agreed with the <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Abfb2?an=JD_HC9310 --##'>hearing committee's findings</a> of fact and concluded that Guidry violated </span> <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=DR1-102'></a>(a), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=DR6-101'>6-101</a>(A)(3), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=DR7-101'>7-101</a>(A), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=DR2-110'>2-110</a>(A)(3) and Rules of Professional Conduct <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.3'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.4'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.16'></a>(d), and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a>. The disciplinary board recommended that Respondent be suspended for one year and one day, that he make restitution to Mrs. Square in the amount of $2,250.00, together with legal interest from July 1, 1990 until paid, and that Respondent be assessed with all costs.&nbsp; On October 29, 1993, Respondent made restitution in the amount of $2,960. 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font size="3">Upon <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Abfb2?an=JD_HC9310 --##'>review of the hearing committee</a> and </font><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A6d3f?an=JD_93-DB-010 --##'>disciplinary board findings and recommendations </a><font size="3">as well as the transcript, record, briefs, and oral argument, it is the decision </font><span class="BodyText">of this court that the recommendation of the hearing committee be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As we noted in</span><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2"> Louisiana State Bar Assn v. White, 538 So.2d 256 (La. 1989),</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> the purpose of lawyer disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer but rather to maintain appropriate standards of professional conduct to safeguard the public, to preserve the integrity of the legal profession and to deter other lawyers from committing ethical violations.&nbsp; The discipline to be imposed will depend on the seriousness of the offense involved and the facts and circumstances of each case.&nbsp; Id. In so doing, we take into consideration both aggravating and mitigating circumstances. </font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2"> Louisiana State Bar Assn v. Rayling 529 So. 2d 1 (La. 1988).</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; Consequently, our decision to impose a less severe disciplinary action than recommended by the disciplinary board in this matter is based upon three principal factors: (1) the conduct giving rise to these proceedings occurred while the respondent was suffering from the emotional and substance abuse problems which gave rise to the conduct for which he was suspended from the practice of law in 1990 in </font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">Louisiana State Bar Assn v. Guidry, 571 So.2d 161 (La. 1990);</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> (2) the delay in bringing disciplinary action; and (3) evidence of rehabilitation.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While prior disciplinary action does not normally serve as a mitigating factor, o</font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">f Louisiana State Bar Assn v. Perez, 471 So. 2d 685 (La. 1985),</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> in this case the evidence in the record indicates that Mr. Guidry's dealings with the Square family occurred </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><i>before </i></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">his 1990 suspension for other disciplinary infractions which had occurred during the same time period.&nbsp; In light of this unique factual situation, we believe that Mr. Guidry's 1990 suspension, because it was imposed </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><i>after </i></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">his dealings with the Squares, should be considered as a mitigating factor.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, this court has recognized that delay in pressing and concluding disciplinary actions constitutes an ordeal which punishes a respondent over and beyond the discipline imposed by this court</font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">.&nbsp; Louisiana State Bar Assn v. Gold, 563 So. 2d 855 (U. 1990); Louisiana State Bar Assn v. Edwards, 387 So.2d 1137 (La. 1980).</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; The conduct at issue in this case occurred six and one half (6 1/2) years before formal charges were filed against Mr. Guidry with the Disciplinary Board of the Louisiana State Bar Association.&nbsp; In mitigating the discipline imposed, this court takes into consideration the length of delay in bringing disciplinary action before imposing discipline on an attorney who has used the intervening years wisely in rehabilitating himself.&nbsp; </font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">See Gold</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><i>, </i></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">supra.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, we conclude that the evidence of Mr. Guidry's rehabilitation should also serve as a factor to consider before imposing discipline.&nbsp; In this case, the record indicates that since being disciplined in 1990</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b>'.&nbsp; </b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Mr. Guidry has been a responsible and stable citizen, has been active in providing free legal work as a public service, and has remained clear of errant and unethical behavior while making strides in his ongoing rehabilitation from the grips of depression and substance abuse.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b>DECREE</b></font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the reasons assigned, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that Burton P. Guidry be</font> suspended <font face='Times New Roman' size="3">from the practice of law in Louisiana for </font>ninety days<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> from the date of this judgment and that he bear all costs of these proceedings.</font></p>

<p><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font>It appears that the attorney's chemical dependency was the primary cause of his disciplinary violation, that the attorney is otherwise morally fit to practice law, and that the attorney's impairment has been brought under control so that the attorney safely can be allowed to practice.&nbsp; However, in exercising its responsibility to the public, this Court should require the Disciplinary Board, with the assistance of the Lawyer's Assistance Program, to evaluate the attorney to determine whether he should be readmitted to practice<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> </font>subject to supervision or monitoring for a reasonable period.&nbsp; See </span><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">Louisiana State Bar Association v. Dumaine, 550 So. 2d 1197 (La. 1989) ; Louisiana State Association Bar v. Longenecker, 538 So. 2d 156 (La. 1988) ;</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> and authorities cited in these decisions.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This precaution seems warranted in light of the fact that, notwithstanding respondent's claim of sobriety since 1988, he has had several disciplinary infractions within the last five years (i.e., since 1989).&nbsp; Although the record indicates that respondent is well into what appears to be a successful recovery, the evaluation of professionals familiar with substance abuse problems in our profession seems prudent.&nbsp; The respondent has not expressed any objection to such an evaluation and has indicated his willingness to submit to supervision.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I respectfully disagree with the Court's failure to require evaluation of the attorney for the purpose of determining whether monitoring or supervision is warranted.</font></p>
