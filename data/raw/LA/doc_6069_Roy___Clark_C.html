<p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="headingstyle">NO. 07-OB-0929</p>
<p class="headingstyle">IN RE: CLARK C. ROY</p>
<p class="headingstyle">ON APPLICATION FOR REINSTATEMENT</p>
<p class="signature">PER CURIAM<a name="fnref_" class="fn" href="#fn_">*</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In 2004, petitioner, Clark C. Roy, was suspended from the practice of law for
three years, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension, pursuant to a 
petition for
consent discipline. In re: Roy, 04-0635 (La. 4/30/04), 872 So. 2d 464. The
disciplinary proceeding stemmed from several complaints against petitioner, 
generally
alleging that he neglected his clients' legal matters, failed to communicate 
with his
clients, misled his clients concerning the status of their legal matters, and 
failed to
refund unearned fees. This misconduct was directly attributable to petitioner's
alcoholism.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Following his suspension, petitioner successfully completed an inpatient
substance abuse treatment program and made substantial progress in maintaining 
his
sobriety. Thereafter, petitioner filed an application for reinstatement, 
asserting that
he has complied with the reinstatement criteria set forth in Supreme Court Rule 
XIX,
§ 24(E). The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") took no position concerning
petitioner's reinstatement. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule XIX, § 24(F) and (G), 
the
matter was referred for a formal hearing before a hearing committee.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After considering the evidence presented, the 
<a href="../HC/2007-02-01_05-DB-040.htm">hearing committee</a> recommended
that petitioner be conditionally reinstated to the practice of law. The 
<a href="../DB/2007-04-26_05-DB-040.htm">disciplinary
board</a> agreed that petitioner has satisfied the requirements for reinstatement by 
clear
and convincing evidence. Accordingly, the board recommended to this court that
petitioner be reinstated to the practice of law, subject to certain conditions 
regarding
his recovery agreement with the Lawyers Assistance Program ("LAP"). Neither
petitioner nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After considering the record in its entirety, we will adopt the disciplinary
board's recommendation and reinstate petitioner to the practice of law, subject 
to the
condition that he must extend his LAP contract for a period of five years and 
fully
comply with the terms and conditions thereof.1 The ODC shall monitor 
respondent's
compliance with his recovery agreement and notify this court of any violation, 
which
may be grounds for immediately transferring respondent to disability inactive 
status,
or placing him on interim suspension, as appropriate.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and
disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that Clark C. Roy,
Louisiana Bar Roll number 8220, be immediately reinstated to the practice of law 
in
Louisiana, subject to the conditions set forth herein. All costs of these 
proceedings
are assessed against petitioner.</p>

Petitioner's current LAP contract expires on September 20, 2007. The five-year 
extension which is a condition of petitioner's reinstatement will subject him to 
monitoring by LAP through 2012.</p>
