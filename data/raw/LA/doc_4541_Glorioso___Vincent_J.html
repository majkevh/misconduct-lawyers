<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 02-B-1074</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: VINCENT J. GLORIOSO, JR.</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p><b>PER CURIAM</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This matter arises from a petition for consent discipline filed by respondent, 
Vincent J. Glorioso, Jr., an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of 
Louisiana but currently on interim suspension. For his misconduct, respondent 
proposed a three-year suspension from the practice of law. The Office of 
Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) concurred in respondent’s petition, and the 
disciplinary board recommended the proposed discipline be accepted.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<h3>The Henderson Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In 1994, respondent was retained to represent Yolanda Henderson in a personal 
injury matter. Shortly thereafter, respondent negotiated a partial settlement of 
Ms. Henderson’s claims. In June 1994, respondent withheld the sum of $4,719 from 
Ms. Henderson’s settlement to pay medical expenses owed to Charity Hospital. In 
April 1997, the balance of respondent’s trust account fell to $3,600, below the 
amount necessary to satisfy Ms. Henderson’s medical lien, resulting in a 
conversion of third-party funds. Respondent did not pay the sums owed to the 
medical provider until May 2001.</p>
<h3>The Lawrence Matter</h3>
<h4>1. The Client Loan</h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">In 1994, respondent was associated by counsel for Neysa Lawrence to assist in 
handling a case involving several tort and product liability claims against 
automobile dealers and manufacturers. The case involved four separate 
settlements in the course of the litigation, which was concluded in 1997.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In April 1996, Ms. Lawrence loaned respondent $52,000 from her settlement funds. 
Respondent failed to have Ms. Lawrence execute the written waiver of conflict 
required by the Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent also failed to advise 
Ms. Lawrence that, prior to entering into the agreement, she was entitled to 
seek the advice of independent counsel in the transaction. Nevertheless, Ms. 
Lawrence did, in fact, consult with her original attorney before entering into 
the transaction.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As security for the $52,000 loan, respondent assigned to Ms. Lawrence his fee 
interest in three personal injury cases. The terms of the assignment called for 
the payment of the note in full upon settlement of the cases, or no later than 
eighteen months from the date of the original obligation. At the time of this 
assignment, however, respondent failed to disclose to Ms. Lawrence that he had 
previously assigned his fee interest in two of the three cases to another 
client, thereby diluting the value of the security interest.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In December 1997, respondent and Ms. Lawrence renewed the note and secured it 
with an assignment of respondent’s fee interest in three different personal 
injury cases. At the time of this assignment, respondent failed to disclose to 
Ms. Lawrence that he had previously assigned a 50% fee interest in the three 
cases to the Glorioso Law Firm, thereby diluting the value of the security 
interest.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent made timely interest payments on the note during the first year. He 
also made approximately $20,000 in principal payments. However, respondent was 
unable to pay the note in full on demand in 1999. In 2000, Ms. Lawrence filed 
suit against respondent to collect the balance owed to her. In April 2001, 
respondent repaid the entire outstanding balance of $32,000.</p>
<h4>2. The Third-Party Medical Provider</h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">In July 1997, respondent withheld the sum of $7,800 from Ms. Lawrence’s 
settlement to pay a subrogation claim by Blue Cross for medical expenses. In 
November 1997, the balance of respondent’s trust account fell to $830.64, below 
the amount necessary to satisfy the Blue Cross lien, resulting in a conversion 
of third-party funds. Respondent did not pay the sums owed to Blue Cross until 
October 1999.</p>
<h3>The Robichaux Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In 1994, respondent was associated by counsel for Guidon Robichaux to assist in 
handling a personal injury matter. Shortly before the case settled in October 
1995,&nbsp;
Mr. Robichaux agreed to loan respondent $66,000 from his settlement funds. 
Respondent failed to have Mr. Robichaux execute the written waiver of conflict 
required by the Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent also failed to advise 
Mr. Robichaux that, prior to entering into the agreement, he was entitled to 
seek the advice of independent counsel in the transaction. Nevertheless, Mr. 
Robichaux did, in fact, consult with his original attorney before entering into 
the transaction.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was subsequently unable to repay the note in accordance with its 
terms, and Mr. Robichaux filed suit against respondent to collect the balance 
owed to him. This suit was dismissed in June 2001, after respondent negotiated a 
repayment schedule with Mr. Robichaux.</p>
<h3>Commingling of Funds</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Between 1994 and 2000, respondent used his client trust account to insulate his 
personal funds from seizure to satisfy a substantial federal income tax lien. 
Respondent kept his attorney’s fees in his trust account for extended periods of 
time and paid personal obligations from the account, resulting in the 
commingling of client funds with his own and subjecting client funds to 
potential seizure by the IRS.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Petition for Consent Discipline</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC conducted an investigation into the complaints filed against respondent. 
As a result of this investigation, the ODC and respondent filed a joint motion 
for interim suspension, which this court granted on August 1, 2001.<span class="CITE">
<i>In re: Glorioso</i>, 01-2166 (La. 8/1/01), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:795%20So.2d%20287 --#">795 So. 2d 287</a></span>. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Prior to the institution of formal charges, respondent filed a petition for 
consent discipline. In that petition, respondent admitted his conduct violated 
the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.8 --#">1.8</a></span> 
(conflict of interest/prohibited transactions between a client and a lawyer), 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.15 --#">1.15</a></span> (safekeeping property of clients or third persons), and 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a></span>(c) (engaging in 
conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation). For his 
misconduct, respondent proposed that he be suspended from the practice of law 
for three years. The ODC concurred in the petition.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-088.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In its report, the disciplinary board found that respondent’s misconduct was 
knowing and violated duties owed to his clients. The board found there appeared 
to be no direct actual harm to respondent’s clients, but that his misconduct 
nonetheless exposed the clients to the possibility of serious injury. Respondent 
also placed the funds of his clients and third parties at substantial risk by 
commingling his personal funds in his trust account at a time when there was an 
outstanding tax lien against him. In addition to depriving the third-party 
medical providers of funds rightfully due them, respondent’s failure to timely 
pay the medical providers and his conversion of funds designated for that 
purpose subjected his clients to the danger of personal liability until the 
expenses were paid. Additionally, Ms. Lawrence and Mr. Robichaux were forced to 
initiate legal proceedings to enforce the terms of their agreements with 
respondent. Finally, although an amicable agreement has been reached between 
respondent and Mr. Robichaux, respondent’s obligation to him has yet to be fully 
satisfied.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based upon its review of the record, the board determined that the aggravating 
factors present include a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, and 
substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted 1966). In mitigation, 
the board found the absence of a prior disciplinary record, full disclosure to 
the disciplinary system, prior good character, and remorse. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After considering the ABA’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions and the 
prior jurisprudence of this court dealing with misconduct similar to 
respondent’s, the board concluded that a lengthy suspension or disbarment is the 
appropriate sanction in this case. However, the board felt the seriousness of 
respondent’s misconduct can be offset to some degree by the mitigating factors, 
particularly respondent’s cooperation in this proceeding and his prior good 
character. After considering all of the circumstances, the board found the 
proposed consent discipline is appropriate and recommended respondent be 
suspended from the practice of law for three years. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board’s 
recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Although this matter arises from a petition for consent discipline, Supreme 
Court Rule XIX, § 20(B) provides that the extent of discipline to be imposed is 
subject to review. In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that 
disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, 
protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future 
misconduct. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The 
discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness 
of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 
1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record reflects that respondent has put his clients’ funds at risk of being 
seized by the IRS to satisfy his tax liability, deprived medical providers of 
funds rightfully due them, and converted third-party funds to his own use. 
Respondent also borrowed money from his clients without complying with the 
safeguards afforded them by the Rules of Professional Conduct and deliberately 
misled one client as to the value of her security interest in the loan. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent’s commingling of client funds (thus exposing them to seizure by the 
IRS) and his failure to pay third-party medical providers would alone justify 
disbarment. See <span class="CITE"><i>In re: McCann</i>, 99-2862 (La. 2/11/00), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:752%20So.2d%20155 --#">752 So. 2d 155</a></span>. Combining 
this misconduct with respondent’s other actions, we have no difficulty finding 
the baseline sanction under these facts is disbarment.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Nonetheless, we find significant mitigating factors are present in this case. 
Respondent has no prior disciplinary record. He has expressed remorse for his 
actions and has fully cooperated in the disciplinary proceedings. Additionally, 
respondent submitted evidence showing he has a good reputation in the legal 
community.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on these factors, we find the proposed consent discipline is appropriate 
under the circumstances. Accordingly, we will accept the petition for consent 
discipline and suspend respondent from the practice of law for a period of three 
years.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and 
considering the record filed herein, it is ordered that Vincent J. Glorioso, Jr. 
be suspended from the practice of law for three years, retroactive to his August 
1, 2001 interim suspension. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed 
against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal 
interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s 
judgment until paid.</p>
