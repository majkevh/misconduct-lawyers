  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 04-B-1363</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: LEROY J. LAICHE, JR.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, Leroy J. Laiche, Jr., an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The underlying facts of this matter are essentially undisputed. Respondent represented Jerri
  Dubois in a personal injury matter arising out of an automobile accident. The police report prepared following the
  accident indicated the accident occurred on February 1, 1996. In June 1996, respondent forwarded a copy of the
  accident report to Louisiana Farm Bureau Casualty Insurance Company ("Farm Bureau"), the insurer of the alleged
  tortfeasor, and initiated settlement negotiations on behalf of Ms. Dubois. These negotiations were not successful,
  however, and on February 6, 1997, respondent filed suit in the matter entitled Jerri Page Dubois v. Kevin W. Brown,
  et al., No. 435-981 on the docket of the 19 th Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge. In the
  petition for damages, respondent alleged that the accident in question occurred on February 7, 1996.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After the suit was filed, Farm Bureau's adjuster informed respondent that Ms. Dubois' claim was
  prescribed and requested that he voluntarily dismiss the suit. Respondent refused to do so, claiming the accident
  report in his file indicated the accident occurred February 7, 1996. Farm Bureau then retained counsel, Edward O.
  Taulbee, IV, to defend its interest. In August 1998, Mr. Taulbee submitted a request for admissions, in which he
  requested respondent to admit that the accident occurred on February 1, 1996. Respondent denied the request for
  admission.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In light of respondent's continued refusal to acknowledge the correct date of the accident, Mr.
  Taulbee obtained a certified copy of the accident report from the Department of Public Safety, conducted a deposition
  of the state trooper who investigated the accident, and secured the station and desk logs maintained by the Louisiana
  State Police. All of this information indicated that Ms. Dubois' accident occurred on February 1, 1996. In September
  1999, after discovery was completed, Mr. Taulbee filed an exception of prescription on behalf of Farm Bureau.
  Respondent opposed the exception and amended the petition for damages to allege that Farm Bureau had previously
  acknowledged its liability to Ms. Dubois, thereby interrupting prescription. The trial court rejected this argument,
  and in November 1999, granted Farm Bureau's exception of prescription and dismissed Ms. Dubois' suit with
  prejudice.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Taulbee then filed a motion for sanctions against respondent, seeking to recover the
  attorney's fees incurred by Farm Bureau in the defense of the litigation. Following a hearing on the motion in
  January 2001, the trial court found that the accident date alleged in respondent's petition for damages was erroneous
  and that respondent wrongfully denied Farm Bureau's request for admission that the correct accident date was February
  1, 1996. The trial court also found that the accident report had been altered by someone in respondent's office to
  show the date of the accident as February 7, 1996 for the specific purpose of covering up the fact that Ms. Dubois'
  case had prescribed. The trial court awarded Farm Bureau $8,000 in sanctions against respondent under La. Code Civ.
  P. art. 863, and ordered respondent to pay costs.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On appeal, Farm Bureau sought an increase in the award of sanctions as well as interest on the
  judgment. The court of appeal declined to award additional attorney's fees but amended the trial court's judgment to
  include legal interest from the date of demand.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent, alleging that
  his conduct in the Dubois matter violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable
  diligence and promptness in representing a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate
  with a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.7(b)</span> (a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation
  may be materially limited by the lawyer's own interests), <span class="allegedrules">5.3</span> (responsibilities
  regarding nonlawyer assistants), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or
  misrepresentation), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the
  administration of justice) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an answer to the formal charges in which he admitted that he allowed Ms. Dubois'
  case to prescribe. However, respondent denied that he altered the accident report in question or allowed someone in
  his office to alter the report. He also denied that he failed to make a reasonable inquiry to verify the date of the
  accident, or that he continued to pursue the matter after being placed on notice of the altered accident report.
  Respondent admitted that his conduct violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">5.3</span>,
  and <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. With respect to the ODC's allegation that
  he violated Rules 8.4(c) and 8.4(d), respondent admitted that a misrepresentation resulted from his conduct, but
  denied that his conduct was motivated by dishonesty, fraud, deceit or specific intent to misrepresent the facts of
  Ms. Dubois' case or to prejudice the administration of justice.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-02-02_03-DB-058.htm">Recommendation of the Hearing
  Committee</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This matter proceeded to a formal hearing on the merits. Based on the evidence presented at the
  hearing, the hearing committee made the following factual findings, in addition to the facts which were admitted by
  respondent in his answer to the formal charges:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1. Respondent negligently allowed someone in his office to alter the date of the accident
    report. The committee determined there was no clear and convincing evidence that respondent personally altered the
    accident report or that he instructed anyone to alter it. Nonetheless, someone in respondent's office did so, and
    this occurred under respondent's supervision as respondent was the supervisory attorney in the office.</p>

    <p class="inverted">2. When advised of the discrepancy, respondent failed to make a reasonable inquiry to verify
    the true date of the accident. The committee did not accept respondent's claim that he was unsure when the accident
    happened because his file contained conflicting accident dates. The committee opined that respondent could easily
    have secured a certified accident report from the State Police in order to verify the date instead of forcing Farm
    Bureau to expend considerable time and money to prove the accident date. Moreover, the date of the accident appears
    in at least four separate places on the report; however, only two of the dates were changed from February 1 to
    February 7. The committee found that these discrepancies should have alerted respondent to the fact that the
    accident date was not February 7, 1996.</p>

    <p class="inverted">3. Respondent's dilatory tactics caused Farm Bureau to incur considerable expenses that were
    not fully satisfied by the sanction of $8,000. Respondent continued to pursue the matter after he was placed on
    notice of the altered accident date, and therefore caused Farm Bureau to spend unnecessary resources to conclude
    what should have been an "open and shut situation."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As respondent admitted in his answer to the formal charges, this conduct violated Rules 1.3, 5.3
  and 8.4(a). The committee found that respondent did not violate Rules 1.4 and 1.7(b).<a name="fnref2" class="fn"
  href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a> The committee made no finding as to the remainder of the rule violations alleged in the
  formal charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the committee determined that
  respondent engaged in a pattern of neglect which caused injury to Farm Bureau and potential injury to his client, the
  baseline sanction for which is a suspension from the practice of law. In mitigation, the committee recognized the
  absence of a prior disciplinary record, respondent's full cooperation with the ODC, and his good faith effort to make
  restitution to his client, Ms. Dubois. The aggravating factors present include vulnerability of the victim and
  substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted 1989).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering these factors, the committee recommended that respondent be suspended from the
  practice of law for ninety days. Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's
  recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-06-03_03-DB-058.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board adopted the hearing committee's factual findings and determined that
  respondent violated Rules 1.3, 5.3, 8.4(a), and <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct. Respondent failed to use reasonable diligence in pursuing Ms. Dubois' case and failed to verify the actual
  date of the accident; failed to adequately supervise his staff with regard to the alteration of the accident report;
  and engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice when he failed to timely cease the litigation
  which caused Farm Bureau substantial expense. However, the board determined that respondent did not violate Rules 1.4
  or 1.7(b), given Ms. Dubois' testimony that she believed respondent kept her informed of the progress of the case,
  including the prescription issue, and that respondent advised her of her right to seek other counsel regarding the
  case, his prescription error, and any restitution due her for the value of her case. The board also found that
  respondent did not violate Rule 8.4(c) because he did not alter the accident report or instruct another to do so, or
  otherwise misrepresent the date of the accident to the court or to Farm Bureau.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board found respondent violated duties owed to his client, the legal system, and as a
  professional. It determined respondent's conduct was negligent insofar as he failed to adequately supervise his staff
  and failed to use reasonable diligence in pursuing Ms. Dubois' case. However, it found respondent's conduct was
  knowing insofar as he failed to timely confirm the date of the accident and failed to timely dismiss the suit against
  Farm Bureau.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In determining the harm caused by respondent's conduct, the board pointed out Farm Bureau was
  required to spend $20,000 to establish the correct accident date, prove there was no acknowledgment of the claim, and
  obtain the dismissal of the case, although it was later awarded all recoverable legal fees and expenses in the amount
  of $8,000. The board observed that Ms. Dubois was in the position to suffer the most harm, but found she testified
  that she was satisfied with respondent's actions and that she has been made whole, as respondent fully satisfied her
  malpractice claim. Thus, the board concluded that while the potential for injury to Ms. Dubois was great, she appears
  to have suffered no financial harm.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Applying the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the board concluded that the baseline
  sanction for respondent's misconduct is a suspension. The board found the record supports the aggravating factor of
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>. In mitigation, the board recognized
  the <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">timely
  restitution to respondent's client</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">cooperation with the disciplinary
  investigation</span>, and the <span class="ABAstandard">imposition of other penalties and sanctions</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, and relying on the prior jurisprudence of this court dealing with
  similar misconduct, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for ninety days. The
  board further recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316
  (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's factual admissions, together with the findings made by the hearing committee and the
  disciplinary board, support the conclusion that respondent failed to adequately supervise his office staff and failed
  to diligently pursue his client's case. Respondent's misconduct caused his client's case to prescribe. In addition,
  respondent's failure to concede the correct accident date after being alerted of the discrepancy forced Farm Bureau
  to expend money and resources to establish the actual date of the accident. This conduct violated Rules 1.3, 5.3,
  8.4(a), and 8.4(d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional misconduct, we now turn to a discussion of an appropriate sanction. In
  considering that issue, we are mindful that the purpose of disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the
  lawyer, but rather to maintain the appropriate standards of professional conduct, to preserve the integrity of the
  legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the standards of the profession.
  <span class="cite">In re: Vaughan, 00-1892 (La. 10/27/00), <a href="2000-10-27_2000-1892.htm">772 So. 2d

  1355</a> (La. 1981)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A review of our prior jurisprudence indicates there is no case directly on point with the facts
  presented in the instant case. However, in cases involving similar acts of unintentional fraud on the part of a
  lawyer, we have generally imposed relatively short periods of suspension. See, e.g., <span class="cite">In re: Cline,
  99-2779 (La. 2/29/00), <a href="2000-02-29_1999-2779.htm">756 So. 2d 284</a></span> (lawyer suspended for six months,
  with three months deferred, for allowing a client to take settlement checks to her prior attorney for endorsement,
  without taking precautions to ensure the client would not obtain fraudulent endorsements on the checks);
  <span class="cite">In re: Wahlder, 98-2742 (La. 1/15/99), <a href="1999-01-15_1998-2742.htm">728 So. 2d
  837</a></span> (lawyer suspended for six months, fully deferred, for permitting his client to place his wife's
  signature on documents); <span class="cite">In re: Broome, <a href="1993-03-26_1992-3332.htm">615 So. 2d 1333</a>
  (La. 1993)</span> (lawyer suspended for ninety days for allowing a member of his staff to falsely represent that a
  suit had been filed when it in fact had not been filed)</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the instant case, the hearing committee made a factual finding, which we accept, that
  respondent did not personally alter the accident report.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a>
  However, respondent's failure to supervise his staff to ensure such actions did not occur and his failure to make
  even minimal efforts to ascertain the true date of the accident warrant a baseline sanction of a suspension from the
  practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the aggravating and mitigating factors present in this case (with particular emphasis
  on the <span class="ABAstandard">imposition of other sanctions</span> in the context of the civil case), we conclude
  that the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct is a suspension from practice of law for a period of ninety
  days.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Leroy J. Laiche, Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 19664, be suspended
  from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of ninety days. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed
  against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days
  from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> Respondent later asserted that when
  the request for admission was propounded, he "had no firm idea whatsoever of what was precisely the date of the
  accident," given that the documents in his file contained conflicting information on that point.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">2</a> Ms. Dubois testified at the hearing
  that respondent notified her of the prescription problem and advised her that she had the right to secure the
  services of another attorney to pursue a malpractice claim, which she declined to do. Ms. Dubois also testified that
  respondent satisfied any malpractice claim, informally, to her satisfaction. In light of this testimony, the
  committee concluded there was no misconduct by respondent towards his client.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3" id="fn3">3</a> Had respondent personally participated
  in the alteration, much more severe discipline would be warranted.</p>
