  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE:  WAYNE JOLLIO JAMES</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 00-DB-147</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE"><b>RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</b></p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="bodycopy"> This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of an Amended Petition for Consent
  Discipline by the Respondent, Wayne Jollio James ("Respondent"), of New Orleans, Louisiana, prior to the filing of
  formal charges.  The Board accepts the Amended Petition and orders that a public reprimand be issued against
  Respondent.</p>

  <h2><b>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</b></h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On November 16, 2000, Respondent filed a Petition for Consent Discipline and Stipulation of
  Facts. On the same day, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") filed a Memorandum in Support of the Sanction and
  a Concurrence in the Consent Discipline.  On February 21, 2001, the Respondent filed an Amended Petition for Consent
  Discipline, changing a condition of probation previously proposed in his original Petition for Consent Discipline. 
  ODC filed an Amended Concurrence in Consent Discipline on February 21, 2001.  Formal charges have not been filed in
  this matter.  On February 22, 2001, a panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed the documents filed in this matter.
  Both Deputy Disciplinary Counsel Eric K. Barefield and the Respondent waived their appearance before the Board and no
  oral argument was held. </p>

  <h2><b>FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS</b></h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The record, including the stipulation of facts, reveals the following information.  In April of
  1998, the Respondent was retained by Emeldia D. Wilson to handle her wrongful termination and employment
  discrimination case against her former employer.  Ms. Wilson maintained that she was fired because of racial
  discrimination.  Initially, Ms. Wilson had handled the case <i>pro se</i>. Respondent at first declined handling the
  case, because on its face it appeared to have various problems.  Though reluctant to accept the case, Respondent
  eventually enrolled as counsel of record on May 7, 1999.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">   Respondent failed to diligently investigate and move the matter forward.  He did not conduct
  any formal discovery on Ms. Wilson's behalf and failed to answer discovery propounded by the defendants. 
  Additionally, he failed to oppose the defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint or motion for summary judgment. 
  Eventually, the court granted the motion for summary judgment.  Respondent also states in his stipulation of facts
  that "when a motion to compel was filed against [him] for sanctions, it created a conflict between himself and his
  client as to whether or not to continue pursuing the case." <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" class="fn"
  id="_ednref1">[i]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent further states in his stipulation of facts that difficulties with the case and
  problems with his client negatively impacted his work in the matter.  He learned through defense counsel that Ms.
  Wilson's employment record included negative evaluations and multiple violations of company policy.  Due to conflicts
  between his client's version and the company's version of events, he was reluctant to move forward.  Ms. Wilson did
  not inform Respondent about the problems she had at work before hiring him to represent her.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">  In mitigation, Respondent asserts that he should not have accepted the case, and when conflicts
  arose between his client and him he should have withdrawn.  He submits that on numerous occasions he urged Ms. Wilson
  to retain new counsel.  Further, he states that he has taken steps to improve his practice, including limiting his
  practice, purchasing a law office management program, and updating his tickler system.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in Louisiana in 1992.  He has been and is
  currently a sole practitioner.  He has no prior disciplinary record and is eligible to practice law. </p>

  <h2><b> </b> PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">In the petition, Respondent admits that his conduct violated Rules of Professional Conduct
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span>,<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn" id="_ednref2">[ii]</a>
  <span class="Rules">1.7</span><a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" class="fn" id="_ednref3">[iii]</a> and
  <span class="Rules">3.2</span>.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" class="fn" id="_ednref4">[iv]</a> Respondent tenders
  a conditional admission to the misconduct, and the parties propose that the following sanction be imposed: </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">A.  Public Reprimand with twelve (12) months probation. </p>

    <p class="inverted">B. Respondent shall establish and maintain an effective calendaring system and method to
    communicate with clients and shall obtain the assistance of the LSBA Loss Prevention Counsel and the Louisiana
    State Bar Association's Practice Assistance Counsel in the creation of a proper law office management program.</p>

    <p class="inverted">C.  Respondent shall enroll in and attend one (1) full day of Ethics School administered by the
    Louisiana State Bar Association's Practice Assistance and Improvement Committee. </p>

    <p class="inverted">D.  Respondent shall maintain current in the law during his period of probation by satisfying
    all annual MCLE requirements of the Louisiana State Bar Association in a timely fashion, pay all Louisiana State
    Bar Association bar dues, and pay all Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board disciplinary assessments imposed by the
    Louisiana Supreme Court. </p>

    <p class="inverted">E. Respondent agrees that he will not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct while on
    probation.</p>

    <p class="inverted">F. Respondent will also respond to all reasonable requests of his probation monitor. </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><b>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</b> </h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span>, <span class="allegedrules">1.7</span>, and
  <span class="allegedrules">3.2</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  The Board must accept that Respondent
  has violated these rules.   <span class="cite"><i>In re Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96);
  <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given the violations of these rules, the Board is
  left to determine if the proposed sanction of public reprimand is appropriate. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors: </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession; </p>

    <p class="inverted">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently; </p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and </p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors. </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">The record in this matter supports a finding that Respondent knowingly violated duties owed to
  his client. While the record fails to provide any solid evidence of the harm suffered by Respondent's client, the
  potential for injury always exists when an attorney fails to exercise due diligence or continues representation after
  a conflict arises.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The record supports a finding that the following mitigating factors are present in this matter:
  <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span> ,<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" class="fn"
  id="_ednref5">[v]</a> <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span> ,<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" class="fn"
  id="_ednref6">[vi]</a> and <span class="ABAstandard">cooperative attitude toward disciplinary proceedings</span>
  .<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" class="fn" id="_ednref7">[vii]</a>   Additionally, the record supports a finding
  that aggravating factors are not present in this matter. </p>

  <h2><b>ANALYSIS</b> </h2>

  <h3><b>I.</b> ABA Standards  </h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing</i> <i>Lawyer
  Sanction</i> (herein "Standard") to determine the baseline sanction by determining "the type of duty violated, the
  lawyer's mental state and the extent of the injury caused; and then adjust[ing] the sanction in accordance with the
  aggravating and mitigating factors present."  <span class="cite"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94);
  <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 350</span>.  </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The proposed sanction is in line with the ABA guidelines.  Under A.B.A. Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span> , a "reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent and does not
  act with reasonable diligence in representing a client, and causes injury or potential injury to the client."  Under
  Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.33</span> , a "reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent in
  determining whether the representation of a client may be materially affected by the lawyer's own interests, . . .
  and causes injury or potential injury to a client."  Standard <span class="ABAstandard">6.23</span> provides that a
  "reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer negligently fails to comply with a court order or rule, and causes
  injury or potential injury to a client . . . or causes interference with or potential interference with a legal
  proceeding."</p>

  <h3><b>II.  </b> Relevant Case Law  </h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Board also looks to relevant case law for assistance in determining an appropriate sanction
  for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The case of <span class="cite"><i>In re Laiche</i>,
  <a href="1999-07-15_98-DB-057.htm">98-DB-057</a></span>, offers guidance here.  <i>In Laiche</i>, formal charges were
  filed against the respondent consisting of five counts that alleged violations of Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3,
  1.4(a)(b), 1.16(d), 8.1(c) and 8.4(g).  After the respondent admitted to violating Rules 1.3, 1.4 and l.16(d), the
  parties later filed a joint motion for consent discipline proposing a public reprimand as the appropriate
  discipline.  Bd. Op. at 1. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Count I of the formal charges brought against Laiche alleged that the respondent filed suit on
  behalf of his clients in a personal injury matter but did little more to move the case forward over the next eight
  years, in violation of Rule 1.3.  Count II of the charges alleged that Laiche failed to keep his clients informed as
  to the progress or lack of progress of the case, in violation of Rule 1.4(a).  The other pertinent counts alleged
  that the respondent failed to timely inform his clients of a settlement offer, which he rejected without consulting
  his clients, and failed to return a file and to timely sign a motion to substitute counsel to clients who had
  discharged him. <i>Id</i>.. at 1-2.  </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The only aggravating factor was respondent's substantial experience in the practice of law. 
  Mitigating factors included the absence of a disciplinary record, no dishonest or selfish motive and a timely good
  faith effort to rectify the misconduct.  <i>Id</i>. at 2.  The Board accepted the joint petition, ordering that the
  respondent receive a public reprimand and that he be assessed with all costs and expenses of the proceedings.   In
  reaching its determination, the Board emphasized the fact that the clients did not suffer any actual harm. 
  <i>Id</i>. at 3. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Another case that lends guidance is <span class="cite"><i>In re Brown</i>,
  <a href="2000-06-13_00-DB-047.htm">00-DB-047</a></span>.  In that case, the respondent was issued a public reprimand
  for violations of Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3 and 1.4(a).  There, the respondent received the file of a client
  from his former associate who had been handling the matter for several years.  Although the client was notified in
  writing of the transfer of the file, the respondent did nothing substantive to move the matter forward or to keep the
  client informed as to the status of the case for over a year.  The only aggravating factor present was the
  substantial experience in the practice of law.  The absence of a prior disciplinary record was cited as a mitigating
  factor.  Bd. Op. at 2-3. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In <span class="cite"><i>In re Ruddick</i>,
  <a href="0000-00-00_94-DB-060.htm">94-DB-060</a></span>, formal charges were filed against the Respondent alleging
  violations of Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3, 1.4, 1.16 and 8.4(g).  There, the Respondent failed to provide his
  clients with a status report regarding a succession matter, neglected to complete the succession and failed to
  communicate with his clients.  He also failed to return documents to the clients and failed to remit an unearned
  fee.  The Respondent also failed to respond to inquiries from ODC concerning the clients' complaint.  Prior to the
  hearing scheduled in the matter, the Respondent filed a motion for consent discipline requesting that he receive a
  public reprimand for his misconduct.  Bd. Op. at pp. 1-2.  ODC concurred, and the Board approved the discipline. 
  Mitigating factors included no prior disciplinary record and personal problems.  Aggravating factors included
  multiple offenses and substantial experience in the practice of law.  <i>Id</i>. at 3-4.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy"> ODC cites the case of <span class="cite"><i>In re Dolbear</i>,
  <a href="1999-02-24_98-DB-061.htm">98-DB-061</a></span> in support of the proposed sanction.  In that case, the
  respondent was retained in a matter involving four imprisoned Mexican nationals and accepted money to obtain their
  release.  He agreed to refund the money if he was unsuccessful.  When he was unsuccessful, he failed to return the
  fee.  In another matter, Dolbear agreed to review a file but failed to return it after the client decided not to
  retain him.  He also failed to cooperate with ODC in its investigation of the complaints.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Board found that Dolbear negligently failed to act with reasonable diligence, negligently
  handled client property, and failed to cooperate with ODC. Numerous aggravating factors were cited by the Board,
  including prior misconduct, failure to cooperate, vulnerability of victim and substantial experience in the practice
  of law.  The mitigating factor of absence of selfish motive was also noted.  The respondent admitted that he violated
  Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3 , 1.4 , 1.5 , 1.16(d) , 8.1 and 8.4(a)(d)(g) .  The Board accepted the proposed
  consent discipline of a public reprimand.  Bd. Op. at pp. 1-2.   </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Finally, another noteworthy case cited by ODC in support of the sanction is
  <span class="cite"><i>In re Dunn</i>, <a href="../SC/1998-06-05_1998-0535.htm">713 So.2d 461</a> (La. 1988)</span>. 
  The facts of <i>Dunn</i>, however, are more egregious than those seen in the matter at hand.  In <i>Dunn</i>, the
  respondent was retained to pursue a personal injury case arising out of vehicular accident.  Although he timely filed
  suit, he failed to actively pursue the suit for more than five years, resulting in dismissal of the suit for
  abandonment.  Dunn acknowledged his error to the client and offered to settle with the client.  He did not, however,
  advise his client to seek advice from independent counsel on the settlement.  The hearing committee found that Dunn
  was not trying to take advantage of his client.  <i>Id.</i> at 463.  The Court imposed a suspension of six months,
  deferred, along with one year of probation.  <i>Id</i>. at 464. </p>

  <h3><b>III. </b> Conclusion  </h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">This matter is akin to the above-cited cases in that the respondents have all engaged in conduct
  involving a lack of diligence or failure to expedite litigation. Given the fact that only one mitigating factor,
  <span class="ABAstandard">lack of prior discipline</span>, has been cited by the parties, and the fact that a
  violation of Rule 1.7 (conflict of interest) also has been agreed to by the parties, the imposition of a reprimand
  along with twelve months probation appears to be appropriate. </p>

  <h2><b>RULING</b> </h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the Amended Petition for Consent Discipline be
  accepted, and that a public reprimand be issued against the Respondent, Wayne Jollio James. Respondent is also
  ordered to serve a twelve-month period of probation subject to the following conditions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">A. Respondent shall establish and maintain an effective calendaring system and method to
    communicate with clients and shall obtain the assistance of the LSBA Loss Prevention Counsel and the Louisiana
    State Bar Association's Practice Assistance Counsel in the creation of a proper law office management program. </p>

    <p class="inverted">B. Respondent shall enroll in and attend one (1) full day of Ethics School administered by the
    Louisiana State Bar Association's Practice Assistance and Improvement Committee. </p>

    <p class="inverted">C. Respondent shall maintain current in the law during his period of probation by satisfying
    all annual MCLE requirements of the Louisiana State Bar Association in a timely fashion, pay all Louisiana State
    Bar Association bar dues, and pay all Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board disciplinary assessments imposed by the
    Louisiana Supreme Court. </p>

    <p class="inverted">D. Respondent agrees that he will not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct while on
    probation. </p>

    <p class="inverted">E.  Respondent will also respond to all reasonable requests of his probation monitor. </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">It is further ordered that Respondent be assessed the costs and expenses of these proceedings,
  with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this Ruling until paid.</p>
