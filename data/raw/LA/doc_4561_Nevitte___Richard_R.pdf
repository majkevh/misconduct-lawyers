<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 02-B-1962</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: RICHARD R. NEVITTE, JR.</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from one count of formal charges filed by the 
Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Richard R. Nevitte, 
Jr., an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana, but 
currently on interim suspension. <a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></p>
<h2>NOTICE OF CHARGES</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">At the outset, we are faced with a problem of procedural due process. The 
formal charges against respondent relate solely to his conviction of a crime. 
However, at the formal hearing, evidence was introduced relating to other 
conduct not charged in the formal charges. The hearing committee found 
additional rule violations based on this uncharged conduct. The question 
presented is whether it would be a denial of due process of law for this court 
to find a lawyer guilty of charges based on evidence adduced at the hearing if 
he was not given notice of these charges prior to the hearing.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Ruffalo</i>, 390 U.S. 544 (1968)</span>, the United States Supreme Court 
addressed a situation in which the lawyer was disbarred based on a charge that 
was not filed until after he had testified. In finding a violation of procedural 
due process, the Court stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are adversary proceedings of a quasi-criminal nature. The charge must 
be known before the proceedings commence. They become a trap when, after they 
are underway, the charges are amended on the basis of testimony of the accused. 
He can then be given no opportunity to expunge the earlier statement and start 
afresh.</p>
<p>390 U.S. at 551 [citation and footnote omitted].</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Bodycopy">We addressed a similar situation in <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. McGovern</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:481%20So.2d%20574 --#">481 So. 2d 574</a> (La. 1986)</span>. In that case, the commissioner, after taking 
evidence, found the lawyer guilty of the original charged misconduct, as well as 
several other breaches of the ethical rules. In refusing to consider this 
uncharged misconduct, we compared the case to Ruffalo, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Likewise, McGovern had no notice that his acts or omissions in the uncharged 
violations would be considered disbarment offenses until after he had testified 
at length on all of the material facts pertaining to them and the commissioner 
had filed his findings based on that testimony. How the charges would have been 
met had they been originally included in those leveled against respondent by the 
bar association no one knows. Accordingly, in order to protect the respondent 
from an unconstitutional deprivation of due process, the violations recommended 
by the commissioner which were added to the initial charges of the bar 
association's petition will not be considered by this court.</p>
<p>481 So. 2d at 577.</p>
</blockquote>

<a href="#!-- #ID:534%20So.2d%20944 --#">534 So. 2d 944</a> (La. 1988)</span>. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Applying the reasoning of those cases, we find the hearing committee erred in 
finding respondent guilty of ethical violations based on the uncharged conduct. 
Accordingly, we will not consider the uncharged conduct and will make no further 
reference to it in this opinion. Rather, we confine our opinion to the charged 
misconduct relating to respondent’s criminal conviction.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">In October 1988, respondent arranged to purchase a used 1986 Jaguar XJ-6 
automobile for the sum of $22,500 through David Jewell, a longtime friend of 
respondent’s who worked as a used car salesman. On October 13, 1988, respondent 
fraudulently secured an inflated personal loan from the Department of Justice 
Federal Credit Union by misrepresenting that the purchase price of the vehicle 
was $31,000.<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> He then delivered the check, representing the proceeds of the loan, 
to Mr. Jewell. Mr. Jewell and another co-conspirator, John Cox, endorsed the 
check and deposited it into Mr. Cox’s bank account. In turn, Mr. Cox gave 
respondent a “rebate” of $3,150, representing the difference between the amount 
of the loan and the actual purchase price of the Jaguar. In January 1989, 
respondent filed an application for a certificate of title with the Commonwealth 
of Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, falsely listing a purchase price of 
$16,500 for the car in order to reduce his liability for sales taxes.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In May 1989, respondent told Mr. Jewell that he was having some mechanical 
problems with the car. Mr. Jewell suggested to respondent that he could have 
someone make the Jaguar “disappear,” enabling respondent to collect the value of 
the car from his insurance company. Respondent agreed to this plan. On May 30, 
1989, respondent left the car in a parking lot in Dunn Loring, Virginia, where 
it was “stolen” by Mr. Jewell and Mr. Cox. That night, respondent reported the 
theft to the Fairfax County, Virginia police department, and the following day, 
he reported the theft to his insurer, USAA Property and Casualty Insurance 
Company. On June 2, 1989, respondent mailed an Affidavit of Vehicle Theft to 
USAA, falsely listing a purchase price of $27,500 for the car. USAA was 
preparing to pay the claim when, on June 18, 1989, the car was recovered in 
Alabama and returned to respondent. Two months later, respondent filed an 
insurance claim for damages the Jaguar had sustained in the “theft.” Respondent 
received a settlement of $994.95 from USAA as a result of this claim. Moreover, 
respondent was successful in having the assessment on the Jaguar lowered by the 
Office of Assessments in Fairfax County, Virginia, first to $12,000 (in October 
1990), then to $10,000 (in April 1991), based upon his false representation that 
the car had major mechanical defects when he purchased it from Mr. Jewell, 
allegedly for the sum of $12,000. Respondent ultimately received $991.69 in 
refunds for the “overassessment” of personal property taxes on the Jaguar. In 
all, the total monetary loss attributable to respondent’s wrongful conduct was 
$33,761.64. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Thereafter, respondent was charged by bill of information in the United 
States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia with one count of 
bank fraud, a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344, and one count of mail fraud, a 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341. On June 19, 1991, respondent pleaded guilty to 
one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and mail fraud, a felony, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. On August 29, 1991, respondent was sentenced to 
serve ninety days in prison and ninety days in home detention confinement, 
followed by two years of supervised release with special conditions. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In December 1998, the ODC moved to place respondent on interim suspension 
based upon his conviction of a serious crime. This court granted the motion on 
January 27, 1999 and ordered that disciplinary proceedings be instituted in 
accordance with Rule XIX. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Nevitte</i>, 98-3005 (La. 1/27/99), 730 So. 2d 868</span>.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">On March 8, 2001, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against 
respondent, alleging that his felony conviction represented a violation of Rules 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct), 
<span class="Rules">8.4(b)</span> (commission of a 
criminal act reflecting adversely on the lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or 
fitness as a lawyer), and <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, 
fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. In 
his answer to the formal charges, respondent admitted his conviction, but denied 
that any further discipline was required “beyond what has already been imposed 
on an interim basis.” Alternatively, respondent asserted that mitigating factors 
exist which would support a finding that no further discipline should be 
imposed. </p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-028.HC --#">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a> </h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the record of this matter, the hearing committee found 
respondent committed a criminal act involving dishonesty and a selfish motive, 
in which he sought to defraud his insurance company, his bank, and the Virginia 
State Department of Revenue. It found these acts were devised solely for 
respondent’s personal gain, and respondent could not, therefore, be considered a 
minor player in the fraud. It also found respondent made no attempt to admit his 
criminal behavior until he was arrested and facing a criminal trial. It 
recognized that respondent made restitution for his fraudulent acts, but did so 
only as part of a plea bargain.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As a mitigating factor, the committee found respondent has no prior 
disciplinary record. Among the aggravating factors found by the committee was 
respondent’s dishonest and selfish motive.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on these factual findings, the committee found that respondent’s 
conviction represented a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct as 
charged in the formal charges. It concluded disbarment was justified in this 
case.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the hearing committee’s 
recommendation. However, in a letter to the disciplinary board, respondent 
conceded that he “can no longer argue in good faith that my conduct does not 
merit disbarment.” </p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-028.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the record of this matter, the disciplinary board found the 
hearing committee’s factual findings with regard to the charged misconduct were 
generally supported by the record, with the exception of the finding relating to 
respondent’s failure to admit his criminal behavior until after “he was arrested 
and facing a criminal trial.” The board noted that while it is true that 
respondent did not confess his crime until the federal charges were imminent, 
the record reveals that respondent was allowed to enter his guilty plea 
simultaneously with the filing of the criminal information by the United States 
Attorney. In all other respects, the board adopted the hearing committee’s 
factual findings, as well as its conclusion that respondent violated the Rules 
of Professional Conduct as charged in the formal charges.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The board found respondent knowingly violated duties owed to the public and 
the profession, and that his conduct caused actual injury to the profession. The 
board found that two mitigating factors are present, namely absence of a prior 
disciplinary record and imposition of other penalties or sanctions. In 
aggravation, the board recognized respondent’s dishonest or selfish motive, 
failure to admit his crime until he was caught, and substantial experience in 
the practice of law.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In light of these considerations, the ABA’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer 
Sanctions, and the prior jurisprudence, the board recommended that respondent be 
disbarred. The board also recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs 
and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running 
thirty days from the date of finality of the court’s judgment until paid.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board’s 
recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. 
La. Const. art. V, § 5(B). When the disciplinary proceedings involve an attorney 
who has been convicted of a crime, the conviction is conclusive evidence of 
guilt and the sole issue presented is whether respondent’s crimes warrant 
discipline and, if so, the extent thereof. Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 19(E); 
<span class="CITE"><i>In 
re: Boudreau</i>, 02 0007 (La. 4/12/02), <a href="#!-- #ID:815%20So.2d%2076 --#">815 So. 2d 76</a></span>; 
<i><span class="CITE">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. 
Wilkinson</span></i><span class="CITE">, <a href="#!-- #ID:562%20So.2d%20902 --#">562 So. 2d 902</a> (La. 1990)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends on 
the seriousness of the offense and the extent of the aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances.<span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Perez</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:550%20So.2d%20188 --#">550 So. 2d 188</a> (La. 1989)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record demonstrates that respondent was convicted of one count of conspiracy 
to commit bank fraud and mail fraud, a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. 
The underlying facts of this conviction reveal a pattern of dishonest, 
fraudulent, and deceitful conduct by respondent spanning a period of more than 
two years. This court has disbarred attorneys convicted of similar crimes. See 
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Schneider</i>, 97 2457 (La. 1/30/98), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:707%20So.2d%2038 --#">707 So. 2d 38</a></span> (mail fraud, conspiracy 
to commit mail fraud, intentionally submitting false statements to a banking 
institution, and tax fraud); <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Naccari</i>, 97 1546 (La. 12/19/97), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:705%20So.2d%20734 --#">705 So. 2d 
734</a></span> (wire fraud); <span class="CITE"><i>In re: King</i>, 94 0686 (La. 11/30/94), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:646%20So.2d%20326 --#">646 So. 2d 326</a></span> (aiding 
and abetting mail fraud). While we recognize respondent’s conviction did not 
arise out of the practice of law, we have held that disbarment may be warranted 
for a conviction not directly connected with the practice of law. 
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Brown</i>, 
95-0817 (La. 5/21/96), <a href="#!-- #ID:674%20So.2d%20243 --#">674 So. 2d 243</a></span>; 
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Frank</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:472%20So.2d%201 --#">472 
So. 2d 1</a> (La. 1985)</span>. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As mitigating factors, we recognize the absence of a prior disciplinary record 
and the imposition of other penalties or sanctions upon respondent. In 
aggravation, we find respondent exhibited a dishonest or selfish motive and 
failed to admit his crime. Respondent also possesses substantial experience in 
the practice of law, having been admitted to practice in Louisiana in 1981. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, we find no basis to deviate from the baseline 
sanction of disbarment. Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board’s 
recommendation that respondent be disbarred. </p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and 
disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that the name of 
Richard R. Nevitte, Jr. be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his 
license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked. All costs and 
expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with 
Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from 
the date of finality of this court’s judgment until paid.</p>

In addition to the fraudulent purchase amount, the bill of sale prepared by Mr. 
Jewell indicated the vehicle had an odometer mileage reading of 29,875 miles, 
when in fact, the odometer mileage reading was 59,875 miles. Respondent has made 
restitution to the credit union of the entire amount of the loan, plus interest.</p>
