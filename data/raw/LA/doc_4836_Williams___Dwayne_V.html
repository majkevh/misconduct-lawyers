  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 04-B-1364</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: DWAYNE V. WILLIAMS</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, Dwayne V. Williams, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana. For the reasons
  assigned, we now disbar respondent.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed four counts of formal charges against respondent. Prior to a hearing on the formal
  charges, respondent and the ODC stipulated to the facts and rule violations alleged in three of the counts. These
  facts may be summarized as follows:</p>

  <h3>Stipulated Facts</h3>

  <h4>The Child Support Matter</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent stipulated that he is in arrears in the court-ordered child support obligation he owes
  to two different women.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a> On at least two occasions,
  respondent failed to appear in court when ordered to do so, resulting in the issuance of bench warrants by the court.
  Respondent also failed to reply to the complaint filed in connection with this matter, necessitating the issuance of
  a subpoena compelling him to appear and answer the complaint under oath.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent stipulated that his conduct violated Rules <span class="Rules">3.4(c)</span> (knowing
  disobedience of an obligation under the rules of a tribunal), <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate
  with the ODC in its investigation), and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h4>The Unauthorized Practice of Law Matters</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Between July 26, 2001 and September 5, 2002, respondent was certified ineligible to practice law
  for failing to comply with the mandatory continuing legal education ("CLE") requirement.<a name="fnref2" class="fn"
  href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a> Nevertheless, during this period of time, respondent represented a client in a personal
  injury matter, settled the claim, and disbursed the funds. Moreover, respondent failed to obtain a written contingent
  fee agreement in the matter. Respondent also handled several criminal cases during the period of his ineligibility.
  He collected legal fees, enrolled as counsel, and made appearances in court on the record, including representing
  clients at sentencing hearings. Finally, respondent failed to reply to the complaints filed in connection with these
  matters.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent stipulated that his conduct violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.5(c)</span>
  (contingent fee matters), <span class="Rules">5.5(a)</span> (engaging in the unauthorized practice of law),
  <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Non-Stipulated Facts</h3>

  <h4>The Hilliard Matter</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Gwendolyn Hilliard, a former employee of respondent, filed a complaint against respondent with
  the ODC, alleging that respondent provided her name as a witness to an automobile accident, when in fact she had not
  witnessed the accident. The ODC obtained a copy of the accident report from the Baton Rouge Police Department, which
  listed no witnesses. The ODC then obtained a copy of the accident report that respondent submitted to the insurance
  company involved in the matter. This report listed Ms. Hilliard's name and phone numbers in the "witnesses" section
  of the report.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent failed to reply to the complaint filed by Ms. Hilliard, necessitating the issuance of
  a subpoena compelling him to appear and answer the complaint under oath.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct violated Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span>, <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving
  dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL HEARING</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As a result of the stipulations by respondent, the only contested matter is the count of the
  formal charges stemming from the complaint filed against respondent by Ms. Hilliard. Respondent testified before the
  hearing committee as to this matter.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">During his testimony at the hearing, as well as during his sworn statement prior to the hearing,
  respondent admitted writing Ms. Hilliard's name and telephone numbers on the accident report but adamantly declared
  that it had been a mistake. He contended that he had been trying to hide his contact with Ms. Hilliard from his wife,
  and the accident report was the only piece of paper available to him when Ms. Hilliard provided him with her phone
  number. Respondent went on to state that the copy he had written on had been inadvertently sent to the insurance
  adjuster during settlement negotiations.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2003-10-20_02-DB-103.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After considering the stipulated facts and the documentary evidence presented at the hearing, the
  hearing committee determined that respondent disobeyed court orders regarding his child support obligations, engaged
  in the unauthorized practice of law, failed to negotiate a written contingency fee agreement, and failed to cooperate
  with the ODC in its investigations. After considering respondent's testimony and the documentary evidence regarding
  the Hilliard matter, the committee found that respondent's testimony was not credible and that he engaged in conduct
  involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation when he placed Ms. Hilliard's name and phone numbers on the
  accident report.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent acted knowingly and intentionally, which caused harm to the legal profession and the
  legal system. The baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct, especially considering the multiple offenses of
  engaging in the unauthorized practice of law, is disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee found the following aggravating factors are present: prior disciplinary
  offenses,<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a> a pattern of misconduct, and bad faith obstruction
  of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the rules or orders of the disciplinary
  agency. The committee identified no mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, the committee recommended that respondent be disbarred. Neither
  respondent nor the ODC objected to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-06-03_02-DB-103.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board adopted the hearing committee's factual findings and determined that
  respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges. Specifically, it agreed
  respondent violated Rule 3.4(c) when he ignored court orders regarding his child support obligation, Rule 8.4(c) when
  he placed Ms. Hilliard's name and phone numbers on an accident report, Rule 1.5(c) when he failed to obtain a written
  contingent fee agreement in a personal injury matter, and Rule 5.5(a) when he engaged in the unauthorized practice of
  law on multiple occasions. Furthermore, respondent violated Rules 8.1(c) and 8.4(g) by failing to cooperate with the
  ODC in its four investigations.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board found respondent knowingly and intentionally violated duties owed to his clients, the
  public, the legal system, and the profession. It determined respondent knew, or should have known, that he had been
  ordered to appear in court relative to his delinquent child support obligations, and found his actions required the
  issuance of bench warrants which resulted in delays of the justice system with attendant costs. Likewise, the board
  found respondent knew that he was ineligible to practice law due to his failure to satisfy his CLE requirements, yet
  he continued practicing law with utter disregard of the Rules of Professional Conduct and the rights of his clients
  to be represented by counsel eligible to practice law. The board determined respondent knew he was obliged to respond
  to the four disciplinary complaints served upon him yet he repeatedly refused to cooperate with the ODC. Moreover, it
  noted respondent exhibited contempt for the disciplinary process, and the disciplinary system expended additional
  resources to subpoena him to obtain his response to the complaints. Finally, the board concluded respondent
  intentionally wrote down his former employee's name and telephone number in the exact space reserved for witnesses on
  an accident report, strongly indicating he intended to perpetrate a fraud on the insurance company.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the board found respondent had a <span class="ABAstandard">prior
  disciplinary record</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">engaged in a pattern of misconduct</span> and
  <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">committed bad faith obstruction of the
  disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the rules or orders of the disciplinary
  agency</span>, and had <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>, having been
  admitted to the bar in 1987. The board found no mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, and the prior jurisprudence of
  this court, the board recommended that respondent be disbarred. The board also recommended that respondent be
  assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316
  (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 348</span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State
  Bar Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a>, 445 (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not
  bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held
  the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings. See <span class="cite">In re:
  Caulfield, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>;
  <span class="cite">In re: Pardue, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d
  150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the instant case, the factual findings of the hearing committee are supported by the record
  and clearly demonstrate that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged in the formal charges.
  Among other misconduct, respondent disobeyed court orders relating to his child support obligations, engaged in
  dishonest conduct, and practiced law when he was ineligible to do so. No less serious is respondent's failure to
  cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the complaints filed in these matters.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional misconduct, we now turn to a discussion of an appropriate sanction. In
  considering that issue, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of
  conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct.
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La.
  1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses
  involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A review of the record indicates that respondent knowingly and intentionally violated duties owed
  to his clients, the public, the legal system, and the profession. Respondent ignored his obligation to appear at
  hearings before the trial court in connection with child support matters. He has flouted the authority of this court
  and disregarded the welfare of his clients by practicing law while ineligible to do so. His chronic failure to
  cooperate with the ODC has caused undue delays and burdened an already taxed disciplinary system. Clearly, the
  baseline sanction for such egregious and persistent misconduct is disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Several aggravating factors are present, the most serious of which is respondent's prior
  disciplinary history involving the same type of misconduct at issue here. We are unable to discern any mitigating
  factors from the record.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board's recommendation and disbar respondent.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Dwayne V. Williams, Louisiana Bar Roll number 18044, be and he hereby
  is disbarred. His name shall be stricken from the roll of attorneys and his license to practice law in the State of
  Louisiana shall be revoked. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with
  Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's
  judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> According to the court records that
  were attached to the complaint, respondent's child support arrearage totaled $20,650 to Lillian Williams and $8,980
  to Sharon Wilson.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">2</a> Respondent was also ineligible between
  September 4, 2001 and August 12, 2002 for failing to pay his bar dues and the disciplinary assessment.</p>
