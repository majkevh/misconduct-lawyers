<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: VINCENT BLANSON</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>


<p>This disciplinary matter arises from two counts of formal charges filed by 
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Vincent Blanson, 
an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">In August 1999, Patricia Clark retained respondent to file a personal injury 
suit on her behalf. Respondent neglected the matter and failed to comply with 
his client’s requests for information concerning the status of the matter, 
forcing Ms. Clark to retain other counsel to file suit and protect her 
interests.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In June 2000, Ms. Clark filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. 
Respondent failed to answer the complaint, necessitating the issuance of a 
subpoena by the ODC. Although respondent appeared pursuant to the subpoena, he 
asked that the matter be continued until he was able to retain counsel. He 
subsequently ignored the ODC’s requests to reschedule the matter. When 
respondent was personally served with a second subpoena, he failed to appear to 
give a sworn statement.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed two counts of formal charges against 
respondent, alleging that his conduct in the Clark matter violated the following 
provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules 
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.3 --#">1.3</a> (failure to act with 
diligence and promptness in representing a client), <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.4 --#">1.4</a> (failure to communicate 
with a client), <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE3.2 --#">3.2</a> (failure to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.1 --#">8.1</a>(c) (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(a) 
(violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct), and 
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(g) (failure to 
cooperate with the ODC in its investigation).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges. 
Accordingly, no formal hearing was held, and the matter was submitted to the 
hearing committee solely on documentary evidence. See Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 
<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s11 --#">11</a>(E)(3).</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-026.hc --#">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Finding the formal charges were deemed admitted and thus proven by clear and 
convincing evidence, the hearing committee turned to the issue of the 
appropriate sanction. Considering the ABA’s <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer 
Sanctions</i><span style="vertical-align: super"><font size="1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></font></span>, 
the committee determined that the baseline sanction for respondent’s misconduct 
is a suspension. The committee found no mitigating factors are present, but 
noted several aggravating factors, including bad faith obstruction of the 
disciplinary process, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, 
vulnerability of the victim, and substantial experience in the practice of law 
(admitted 1984). In light of these considerations, the committee recommended 
that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year and one day.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the hearing committee’s 
recommendation.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-026.bd --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the record of this matter, the disciplinary board found the 
hearing committee’s findings of fact are not manifestly erroneous, and that the 
committee correctly applied the Rules of Professional Conduct. The board found 
respondent knowingly, if not intentionally, violated duties owed to his client 
and the profession. The board determined respondent’s conduct resulted in actual 
injury to his client by delaying the resolution of her legal matter when she had 
various medical bills outstanding, and that the legal system was harmed by 
respondent’s failure to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation. The board 
adopted the aggravating factors recognized by the hearing committee, with the 
exception of vulnerability of the victim, as to which there is no evidence. The 
board agreed that there are no mitigating factors present.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In light of these findings and the prior jurisprudence involving neglect of 
legal matters combined with failure to cooperate, the board suggested that 
respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year and 
one day. The board also recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs 
and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running 
thirty days from the date of finality of the court’s judgment until paid. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board’s 
recommendation</p>
<h3>DISCUSSION</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record supports the findings of the hearing committee and disciplinary 
board that respondent knowingly, if not intentionally, neglected his client’s 
personal injury matter, failed to communicate with his client, and failed to 
cooperate with the ODC. Therefore, the sole issue presented for our 
consideration is the appropriate sanction for respondent’s misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary 
proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the 
public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct.
<span class="CITE">
<i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The 
discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness 
of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> 
(La. 1984)</span>. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent’s actions caused harm to Ms. Clark by delaying the legal matter 
for which she retained him. Respondent’s substantial experience in the practice 
of law is an aggravating circumstance, as is his intentional failure to 
cooperate with the ODC in its disciplinary investigation. We are unable to 
discern any mitigating factors from the record.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Under these facts, we find a one year and one day suspension is an 
appropriate sanction which will deter any future misconduct by respondent and 
protect the public. Accordingly, we will adopt the disciplinary board’s 
recommendation and suspend respondent from the practice of law for one year and 
one day.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and 
disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that Vincent Blanson be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for one year and one 
day. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in 
accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE10.1 --#">10.1</a>, with legal interest to commence 
thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s judgment until paid.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1"><font size="2">1 </font> </a><font size="2">Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer 
knowingly fails to perform services for a client and

lawyer knowingly violates a duty
owed to the profession and causes injury or potential injury to the client, the 
public, or the legal system
(Standard 7.2).</font></p>
