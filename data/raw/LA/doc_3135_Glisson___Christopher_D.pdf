<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 98-DB-047</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>
<p class="signature"><b>PER CURIAM</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This is a
disciplinary
proceeding based on the
filing of a
joint petition for consent
discipline by the Respondent, Christopher D. Glisson ("Respondent"), of Baton
Rouge,
Louisiana, and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC"). For the reasons 
stated below, the Board accepts the joint petition and orders that a public reprimand be issued against Respondent.</p>
<p class="headingstyle" ><b>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">ODC filed formal charges, consisting of one count,
against Respondent on July 14,
1998.&nbsp; On August
7,
1998,
Respondent filed a Motion for More Definite Statement, Motion to Strike,
and Motion for
Extension of Time to Answer.&nbsp;
The ODC opposed the motion, and on August 17,
1998,
the hearing committee chair denied the motion. Subsequently, on
August 26,
1998, the
hearing committee chair amended his order to allow Respondent a twenty-day 
extension of time
to file his answer. <a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an answer to the formal charges denying the allegations on 
August 25,
1999.
A hearing on the merits was set for January
25,
1999,
before
Hearing Committee Number
25 in
Baton Rouge,
Louisiana.
Later, upon the motion of Respondent, the hearing was continued until March 22, 1999. Both 
Respondent and the ODC filed pre-hearing memoranda. The he was held on March 22, 
1999<a class="fn" href="#fn">2</a>, and the parties also filed post-hearing memoranda.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee issued 
its report on March 2, 2000, finding that Respondent had solicited the clients 
at issue in violation of Rule <span class="Rules">7.2(a)</span> and 
<span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. 
Based on these violations, the committee recommended that both a public 
reprimand and a ninety-day suspension be issued to Respondent. One member 
dissented, suggest that a reprimand was the appropriate sanction.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Oral argument before the 
Disciplinary Board was held on May 25, 2000. Mr. G. Fred Ours represented the 
ODC. Respondent appeared and was represented by Mr. Karl L. Koch.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On January 16, 2001, the 
Disciplinary Board issued a ruling which concluded that the hearing committee 
erred. The Board determined that ODC had failed to prove by clear and convincing 
evidence that Respondent violated Rule 7.2(a) and Rule 8.4(a) of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct. Furthermore, after a <i>de novo</i> review of the record, the 
Board ruled that ODC failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that 
Respondent violated any of the other Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in 
the formal charges. Accordingly, the Board ordered that the formal charges filed 
against Respondent be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Following the issuance of 
the Board's ruling, ODC filed a timely appeal of the ruling and, accordingly, the 
matter was to be docketed before the Louisiana Supreme Court. Thereafter, the 
parties entered into negotiations concerning the filing of a joint petition for 
consent discipline. Prior to the date of oral argument before the Court, the 
parties, on February 26, 2001, filed a joint motion for extension of time or stay 
of proceedings with the Louisiana Supreme Court, requesting that the 
Court stay and/or extend the time for objecting to the Board's ruling until ten days after the 
Board's mailing of its decision to either accept or reject the proposed consent 
discipline at bar. The Court granted the motion on March 2, 2001.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy" >In the interim, on February 
28, 2001, the parties filed a joint petition for consent discipline based upon 
an admitted violation of Rule 5.3(a)<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> The parties propose a public reprimand as 
the appropriate sanction.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy" >On March 29,2001, oral 
argument concerning the joint petition was held before the Disciplinary Board. 
Deputy Disciplinary Counsel G. Fred Ours represented ODC. Respondent appeared and was represented 
by James R. Clary, Jr.</p>
<p class="headingstyle"  ><b>FORMAL CHARGES</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy" >The formal charges allege that 
Respondent solicited the representation of Betty Smith Brown and Claude Smith, 
Sr., whose son, Claude Smith, Jr., had been shot and killed in the parking lot 
of a Baton Rouge fast food restaurant.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy" >More specifically, the formal 
charges allege violations of the following Rules of Professional Conduct: 
<span class="allegedrules">1.2(a)</span> 
(scope of representation), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate), 
<span class="allegedrules">1.6(a)</span> (confidentiality 
of intimation), <span class="allegedrules">1.7(b)</span> (conflict of interest), 
<span class="allegedrules">1.8(b)</span> (improper use of 
information relating to representation), <span class="allegedrules">
7.2(a)</span>, <span class="allegedrules">7.2(c)(ii)</span> (direct contact 
with prospective clients), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> 
(violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct 
involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging 
in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice)</p>
<p class="headingstyle"  ><b>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy" >On April 28, 1996, Claude Smith, Jr. was shot and killed hi the parking lot of a 
Taco Bell fast food restaurant in Baton Rouge. Respondent had previously 
represented another individual for injuries he sustained in an attack outside 
the same establishment. Respondent was able to obtain a settlement with Taco 
Bell or its insurers for that individual.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy" >According to Respondent, he became aware of the death of Claude Smith, 
Jr. from 
information received by the previous client. In response to being made aware of 
the shooting, on. November 18, 1996, Respondent sent a letter to Smith's mother, 
Ms. Betty Smith Brown. A series of correspondence subsequently developed between 
Respondent, Ms. Bro and her husband, culminating in Respondent's being retained 
by the Browns to p sue a civil lawsuit in connection with the death of Claude 
Smith, Jr.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy" >During the course of this representation, Respondent became aware of the fact 
that
Claude Smith, Jr.'s biological father, Claude Smith, Sr., was alive and 
apparently residing in
New Orleans. In an attempt to locate Smith, Sr., Respondent employed a private 
investigator.&nbsp;
The activities of the investigator ultimately caused the Browns to discharge 
Respondent.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy" >Prior to the termination of his services by the Browns, Respondent 
succeeded in locating
and arranging a meeting with the elder Smith. Prior to this meeting, Respondent 
prepared two petitions, one on behalf of Betty Brown and a second one an behalf 
of Betty Brown and Claude Smith, Sr. Respondent also prepared a contingency fee 
contract made out in the name of Claude Smith, Sr. At the meeting, Respondent 
informed Smith, Sr. of his rights and his cause of action.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy" >Respondent also 
presented to Smith, Sr. the contingency fee contract, which he signed.
Following the meeting, Respondent filed the petition listing Ms. Brown and Smith, 
Sr. as plaintiffs in the Civil District Court of Orleans Parish. The Browns 
retained another attorney,&nbsp;
Clarence Roby, and eventually settled with the defendants. Smith, Sr.'s suitwas 
dismissed after Respondent was unable to again locate him during the 
proceedings.</p>
<h2  >PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy" >In the joint petition, the parties submit that Respondent failed to properly 
supervise the private investigator retained by Respondent to locate Smith, Sr. 
The private investigator contacted Betty Smith Brown via telephone, falsely 
identified himself as an employee of the East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office, and 
requested information concerning Smith, Sr.'s whereabouts from Mrs. Brown. He 
concealed the fact that Respondent employed him, and he misrepresented the 
purpose of his telephonic contact with Ms. Brown. Respondent had no knowledge of 
the tactics employed by the investigator, but admits that he did not adequately 
or properly instruct the investigator in a manner consistent with the 
responsibilities imposed by Rule 5.3(a). Respondent tenders a conditional 
admission to the misconduct, and the parties propose that a 
sanction of public reprimand be imposed.</p>
<h2  >VALIDITY OF THE PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy" >This consent discipline is novel in that it was filed after the Board's first 
ruling was issued on January 16, 2001 and it is based upon a rule violation that 
was not included in the formal charges. Nevertheless, the Board is unable to 
locate any provision in Rule XIX which would prohibit such a filing after a 
ruling has been issued. The parties also agree that the case of
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State 
Bar Association vs. Keys</i>, 88-B-2441 (La. 9/7/90);
<a  href="../SC/1990-09-07_1988-2441.htm">567 So.2d 588</a></span> permits them to 
rely on this rule vi which was not originally alleged in the formal charges. The 
parties maintain that although not specifically alleged, this rule violation is 
a lesser, included offense to those originally charged.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy" >In <i>Keys</i>, disciplinary proceedings were brought against the respondent alleging
misconduct in the handling of a succession. The respondent was charged with 
commingling and conversion of client funds. During the proceedings, it was 
revealed that the respondent's secretary had, without his knowledge, removed 
over $40,000 r the succession account to pay office operating expenses. The 
attorney argued that the proceedings should be dismissed becaus6 the Bar 
Association failed to prove the express specifications of misconduct in the 
notice served on him; speci1 the charges did not allege that he had failed to 
supervise the handling of the succession finds. <i>Id</i> at 589, 591.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy" >The Court held that charging an attorney with intentionally writing unauthorized 
checks on a succession account and applying the proceeds for the attorney's own 
use, included the lesser charge of failing to set up adequate procedures for 
safeguarding client's thuds. The Court explained that the purpose of requiring 
notice of the charges and a subsequent opportunity to be heard on the charges is 
to prevent prejudice to the accused attorney in preparing and presenting a 
defense. The Court found that the respondent had not been prejudiced during the 
proceedings. <i>Id</i>. at591.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy" >In the matter at hand, the allegations put forth in the formal charges, arguably 
include the lesser charge of failure to supervise Respondent's investigator. 
Most significantly, however, Respondent has admitted to the Rule 5.3(a) 
violation and in no way argues that he has been prejudiced by the application of 
this new rule. Moreover, as explained in <span class="CITE"><i>In re Lieberman</i>, 95- 2628 (La. 6/7/96);
<a  href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">615 So. 2d 272</a>, 273 (La. 1996)</span>, once Respondent and ODC have a that a rule 
violation has occurred, the Board may not reject the consent discipline claiming 
that there
was no violation. The Board accepts that the Respondent has violated this rule.</p>
<h2  >APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy" >Given the violation of Rule 5.3(a), the Board is left to determine if the 
proposed sanction of public reprimand is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy" >Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that 
in imposing a sanction after a finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board 
shall consider the following factors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="inverted" >(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the .public, to 
the legal system, or to the profession;</p><p class="inverted" >(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p><p class="inverted" >(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; 
and</p><p class="inverted" >(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Bodycopy" >Based upon the stipulation of facts filed by the parties, the Board finds that 
Respondent negligently violated duties owed to his client and to the profession. 
Because of Respondent's failure to properly supervise his non-lawyer employee, 
Respondent's client, Mrs. Brown, suffered undue hardship and emotional stress. The parties 
note that the sole aggravating factor present in this matter is Respondent's 
<span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>.<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> The parties state that the 
mitigating factors of absence of a <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary record</span> and<a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span><a class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a> are present in this matter. Furthermore, the record supports a finding that the 
mitigating factor of <span class="ABAstandard">cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings</span> is 
also present.</p>
<h2  >ANALYSIS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy" >The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's 
<i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer 
Sanction</i> (herein "Standard") to determine the baseline sanction by [determining] 
"the type of duty violated, the lawyer's mental state and the extent of the 
injury caused; and then adjust[ing]
the sanction in accordance with the aggravating and mitigating factors present." 
<span class="CITE"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 91-1316 (La. 11/30/94); 
<a  href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 350</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy" >The proposed sanction is in line with the ABA guidelines. Under ABA Standard 
<span class="ABAstandard">7.3</span>, "a reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer negligently engages in 
conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional, and causes injury 
or potential injury to a client, the public or the legal system." The comments 
to this standard state that "[c]ourts also impose reprimands on lawyer who are 
negligent in supervising their employees."</p>
<p class="Bodycopy" >The Board also looks to relevant case law for assistance in determining an 
appropriate sanction for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. In 
<span class="CITE"><i>In 
re Cline</i>, 99-2779 (La. 2/29/00); <a  href="../SC/2000-02-29_1999-2779.htm">756 So. 2d 284</a></span>, the attorney allowed his client 
to take settlement checks to her previous attorney's office for his endorsement. 
The checks later turned up forged. The Court found that Clime failed to take 
minimal steps to ensure that the checks were properly transmitted
to the client's prior attorney and deviated from his normal office procedures. 
Court determined that in such a situation the baseline sanction for an 
attorney's failure to supervise a non-lawyer would ordinarily be a public 
reprimand; however, in that case, Cline's prior disciplinary record justified an 
upward deviation from this baseline sanction. In fact, Cline had been previously 
admonished for similar misconduct. A six month suspension, with three months 
deferred, followed by two years of supervised probation, was imposed. <i>Id</i> at 
289-90. Here, since the Respondent has no prior disciplinary record, a public 
reprimand is the appropriate sanction.</p>
<h2  >RULING</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy" >Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the joint petition for consent 
discipline be accepted, and that a public reprimand be issued against the 
Respondent, Christopher D. Glisson. It is further ordered that Respondent be 
assessed the costs and expenses of these proceedings,
Standard 9.32(e).
with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality 
of this ruling until paid.</p>
