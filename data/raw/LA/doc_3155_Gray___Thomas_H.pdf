  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DICIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary proceeding is based on the filing of a Petition for Consent Discipline
  by Thomas H. Gray ("respondent") after the filing of Formal Charges.  In the petition, respondent admits that he
  violated Rules 1.3 (lack of due diligence), 1.4(a) (lack of communication), 1.7(a) (involvement in a conflict of
  interest), and 1.16(d) (failure to properly withdraw) of the Rules of Professional Conduct in connection with his
  handling of a succession matter.  For the reasons stated below, the disciplinary board approves the consent
  discipline and issues a public reprimand to the respondent and orders probation for a period of eighteen months
  subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Petition for Consent Discipline.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Formal Charges were filed on August 30, 2002 and were served on respondent at his primary
  registration address.  After securing an extension of time, respondent answered the Formal Charges on November 20,
  2002.  The matter was scheduled for hearing on March 6, 2003, however, before the commencement of the hearing,
  respondent filed a Petition for Consent Discipline, a Stipulation of Facts, a Waiver of Opportunity to Withdraw and
  an Affidavit of Consent Discipline.  ODC filed a Concurrence in Consent Discipline and a Memorandum in Support of
  Consent Discipline.  Accordingly, the matter was removed from the hearing docket and was scheduled for review before
  the board on July 31, 2003.</p>

  <h2>STIPULATION OF FACTS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The respondent stipulated the following:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div id="fc02-DB-087">
      <h3>I.</h3>

      <p>Thomas H. Gray was admitted to practice law on October 24, 1975. </p>

      <h3>II.</h3>

      <p>Thomas H. Gray has no prior attorney discipline by the Louisiana Supreme Court.</p>

      <h3>III.</h3>

      <p>Thomas H. Gray was hired to handle a succession for Majorie Boneno in 1982 after her mother's death.  The case
      was filed in 1983 in Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Case No. 83-8863, entitled <u>Succession of 
      Irma R. Schroeder Feliu</u>. </p>

      <h3>IV.</h3>

      <p>During the representation, Mrs. Boneno and her sister, Mrs. Otto, co-executrixes, began to have conflicting
      views.  Mr. Gray continued to represent both of them though there was a conflict of interest.  Mrs. Boneno became
      upset because Inheritance and Federal Fiduciary Income Taxes were owed.  Mrs. Boneno then implied that she would
      hire another lawyer. </p>

      <h3>V.</h3>

      <p>For years, neither Mr. Gray nor Mrs. Boneno did anything on the case to move the matter further.  Mr. Gray did
      not know if he was still representing Mrs. Boneno or expected to complete the succession based on Mrs. Boneno's
      implication.  Mrs. Boneno, on the other hand, believed that Mr. Gray was representing her and moving forward on
      the case to complete the succession. </p>

      <h3>VI.</h3>

      <p>Mrs. Boneno learned in February of 2000 that the succession was incomplete when she attempted to secure a
      mortgage loan on some property that she should have been placed in possession of in the succession.  Thomas Gray
      had failed to file a Petition for Possession in favor of Mrs. Boneno and Mrs. Otto, failed to file a Judgment of
      Possession, and failed to pay or file the Inheritance Tax Returns even though the money was being held in his
      escrow account and entrusted to him. </p>

      <h3>VII.</h3>

      <p>The funds for the Federal Fiduciary Income Tax Return were not collected by Thomas H. Gray and were not held
      in escrow; they also need to be paid.</p>

      <h3>VIII.</h3>

      <p>Mr. Gray did not adequately communicate with his clients and failed to return phone calls.  In August of 2000,
      Mrs. Boneno wrote a letter to Thomas H. Gray terminating their attorney-client relationship but Mr. Gray never
      withdrew as attorney of record in the case or communicated with Mrs. Boneno.  Mrs. Boneno then forgot that she
      had fired Mr. Gray and awaited the completion of the succession but to no avail.</p>

      <h3>IX.</h3>

      <p>Mrs. Boneno brought this matter to the attention of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and Mr. Gray has
      expressed several mitigating factors, particularly, the terminal illness and subsequent death of his wife, which
      seem to have prevented him from completing this matter sooner.</p>

      <h3>X.</h3>

      <p>Mr. Gray has as of this date formally withdrawn from the case, submitted a complete accounting, returned the
      original file and delivered two escrow checks made payable to the Succession of Irma R. Schroeder Feliu, totaling
      $1, 454.64, to Mrs. Boneno's new attorney.  Additionally, Mr. Gray had the Inheritance Tax Return signed by Mrs.
      Otto and delivered the same to Mrs. Boneno's attorney for her signature and for his completion of the succession
      and the remaining matters connected with the succession.</p>

      <h3>XI.</h3>

      <p>Thomas H. Gray's conduct violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (lack of due diligence),
      <span class="allegedrules">1.4(a)</span> (lack of communication), <span class="allegedrules">1.7(a)</span>
      (involvement in a conflict of interest), and <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> (failure to properly
      withdraw) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
    </div>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>PROPOSED DISCIPLINE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent proposes that he be issued a public reprimand and eighteen months of supervised
  probation subject to special conditions. ODC concurs.  The proposed conditions of probation are as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1.  Attendance and completion of the Louisiana State Bar Association's Attorney-Client
    Assistance Program which entails attendance at Ethics School, and good faith facilitation/mediation with Majorie
    Boneno and/or her new attorney in an effort to complete the succession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">2.  Remaining current in all his professional obligations such as disciplinary assessment, bar
    dues, and M.C.L.E.;</p>

    <p class="inverted">3.  Appointment of a probation monitor to monitor all of Thomas H. Gray's active files;</p>

    <p class="inverted">4.  Payment of all costs of these proceedings;</p>

    <p class="inverted">5.  Refraining from any future misconduct and fully cooperating with any future disciplinary
    investigations;</p>

    <p class="inverted">6.  Cooperating with the civil proceedings pertaining to this matter.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that respondent violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span>
  (lack of due diligence), <span class="Rules">1.4(a)</span> (lack of communication), <span class="Rules">1.7(a)</span>
  (involvement in a conflict of interest), and <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span> (failure to properly withdraw) of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct.  The Board must accept that respondent has violated these rules.<a href="#_ftn1"
  name="_ftnref1" class="fn" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>  Given the violations, the Board is left to determine if the
  proposed sanction is appropriate.</p>

  <h2>SANCTION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li class="bodycopy">whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system,
    or to the profession;</li>

    <li class="bodycopy">whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</li>

    <li class="bodycopy">the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</li>

    <li class="bodycopy">the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court also relies on the <i>ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>
  ("ABA Standards") to determine the baseline sanction.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">  By violating Rules 1.3 (lack of due diligence), 1.4(a) (lack of communication), 1.7(a)
  (involvement in a conflict of interest), and 1.16(d) (failure to properly withdraw) of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct   respondent violated duties owed to his client and as a professional.  While ODC's Concurrence indicates
  that respondent's state of mind was apparently negligent, it is difficult to fathom that respondent's conduct was
  not, at least in some part, knowing.  He was hired to handle the matter in 1982 and initiated succession proceedings
  at Civil District Court in 1983.  He was discharged eighteen years after he was hired at which time the succession
  was still not complete.  It is implausible that respondent negligently failed to recognize that he engaged in a
  conflict of interest by representing two heirs who disagreed as to the handling of the succession matter.  The
  stipulated facts indicate that at one point, he was uncertain as to whether he represented Ms. Boneno or whether he
  was expected to complete the succession.  Obviously, he failed to communicate with his client at that time to
  determine his status.  The facts also indicate that when he was terminated in August of 2000, he failed to withdraw. 
  These facts suggest that respondent's conduct was knowing.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Regarding harm, the stipulated facts indicate that respondent has withdrawn from the succession,
  submitted a complete accounting, returned the original file, delivered two escrow checks made payable to the
  succession, and delivered a signed inheritance tax return to Ms. Boneno's new attorney.  Further, the proposed
  discipline includes respondent's agreement to cooperate with Ms. Boneno and/or her attorney to complete the
  succession and to cooperate with any civil proceedings pertaining to the matter.  Inasmuch as it appears that
  respondent has taken the necessary steps to rectify the situation, the only apparent harm is that his clients' legal
  matter has been delayed.  There is no indication as to whether Ms. Boneno suffered any harm by her inability to
  secure a loan on succession property.  ODC's concurrence indicates that respondent's misconduct did not result in any
  permanent or serious harm.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Given the circumstances, the ABA Standards suggest that either suspension or public reprimand is
  the appropriate baseline sanction.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" class="fn" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>  The baseline
  sanction is to be adjusted in accordance with the presence of aggravating and mitigating factors.<a href="#_ftn4"
  name="_ftnref4" class="fn" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> The stipulated facts show that the sole aggravating factor is
  respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>.  He was admitted in
  1975.  Several mitigating factors are present, including the <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior
  disciplinary record</span>; the <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest or selfish motive</span>;
  <span class="ABAstandard">personal or emotional problems</span>, considering that respondent's wife was suffering a
  terminal illness at the time of the misconduct; <span class="ABAstandard">good faith effort to rectify his
  misconduct</span> by forwarding to Mrs. Boneno's new attorney, all records and monies in his possession in an effort
  to assist with the completion of the succession; <span class="ABAstandard">full and free disclosure to disciplinary
  board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings</span>; and, <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Considering the facts and circumstances involved in the instant matter, the heavy mitigating
  factors and the fact that there appears to have been no significant harm, the jurisprudence of this state supports a
  public reprimand as the appropriate sanction. For example, in <span class="CITE"><i>In re Laiche</i>,
  <a href="1999-07-15_98-DB-057.htm">98-DB-057</a> (L.A.D.B. 7/15/99)</span>, Formal Charges consisting of five counts
  were filed against an attorney alleging violations of Rules of Professional Conduct.  Mr. Laiche admitted violating
  Rules 1.3 (diligence), 1.4 (communication) and l.16(d) (termination of representation) and the parties filed a joint
  motion for consent discipline proposing a public reprimand as the appropriate discipline.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Count I of the Formal Charges brought against Mr. Laiche alleged that he filed suit on behalf of
  his clients in a personal injury matter but did little more to move the case forward over the following eight years,
  in violation of Rule 1.3.  Count II of the charges alleged that Mr. Laiche failed to keep his clients informed as to
  the progress or lack of progress of the case in violation of Rule 1.4(a).  The other pertinent counts alleged that
  Mr. Laiche failed to timely inform his clients of a settlement offer, which he rejected without consulting his
  clients, failed to return a file and failed to timely sign a motion to substitute counsel. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">  The only aggravating factor was Mr. Laiche's substantial experience in the practice of law. 
  Mitigating factors included the absence of a disciplinary record, no dishonest or selfish motive and a timely good
  faith effort to rectify the misconduct.  The Board accepted the joint petition, ordering that Mr. Laiche be issued a
  public reprimand and that he be assessed with all costs and expenses of the proceedings. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">  In <span class="CITE"><i>In re Brown</i>, <a href="2000-06-13_00-DB-047.htm">00-DB-047</a>
  (L.A.D.B. 6/13/00)</span>, an attorney was issued a public reprimand for violations of Rules 1.3 and 1.4(a) of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct.  In <i>Brown</i>, the respondent received the file of a client from his former
  associate who had been handling the matter for several years.  Although the client was notified in writing of the
  transfer of the file, Mr. Brown did nothing substantive to move the matter forward or to keep the client informed as
  to the status of the case for over a year.  The only aggravating factor present was the substantial experience in the
  practice of law.  The absence of a prior disciplinary record was cited as a mitigating factor. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">  In <span class="CITE"><i>In re Ruddick</i>, <a href="0000-00-00_94-DB-060.htm">94-DB-060</a>
  (L.A.D.B.)</span>, Formal Charges were filed against an attorney alleging violations of Rules of Professional Conduct
  1.3 (diligence), 1.4 (communication), 1.16 (termination of representation) and 8.4(g) (failure to cooperate).  Mr.
  Ruddick failed to provide his clients with a status report regarding a succession matter, neglected to complete the
  succession and failed to communicate with his clients.  He also failed to return documents to the clients and failed
  to remit an unearned fee.  In addition, Mr. Ruddick failed to respond to the inquiries of ODC concerning the clients'
  complaint.  Prior to hearing scheduled, Mr. Ruddick filed a motion for consent discipline requesting that he be
  issued a public reprimand for his misconduct.  ODC concurred and the Board approved the discipline.  Mitigating
  factors included no prior disciplinary record and personal problems.  Aggravating factors included multiple offenses
  and substantial experience in the practice of law. </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="bodycopy">  Considering the rule violations, the lack of any permanent or serious damage, and the heavy
      mitigating factors, including the respondent's willingness to rectify any harm, his lack of prior discipline, and
      significant personal problems, the proposed discipline is appropriate.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the foregoing, the board approves the consent discipline and orders that Thomas H.
  Gray be issued a public reprimand and eighteen months of supervised probation subject to the following special
  conditions:</p>
