  <span class="Sanction">Suspension</span></h1>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 03-B-2190</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: BARRY E. EDWARDS</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from six counts of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Barry E. Edwards, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana,
  but currently on suspension.</p>

  <h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY RECORD</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Before addressing the instant charges, a review of respondent's prior disciplinary history is
  helpful.  On June 13, 1997, this court placed respondent on interim suspension based on a felony drug conviction and
  ordered disciplinary proceedings to be instituted.  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Edwards</i>, 97-0624 (La.  6/13/97),
  695 So. 2d 1325</span> (<i>"Edwards I"</i>).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed formal charges based on respondent's conviction and other professional misconduct. 
  After proceedings, the disciplinary board recommended respondent be disciplined.  On December 17, 1999, this court
  suspended respondent for a period of three years, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension, followed by a
  two-year period of supervised probation, based upon misconduct involving his substance abuse conviction, failure to
  return unearned fees, failure to act with diligence and failure to cooperate in disciplinary proceedings. 
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Edwards</i>, 99-1783 (La. 12/17/99), <a href="1999-12-17_1999-1783.htm">752 So. 2d
  801</a></span> ("<i>Edwards II</i>").  Although respondent has been eligible to seek reinstatement from this
  suspension as of June 13, 2000, he has not done so. </p>

  <h2 >FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <h3>Count I - Everett Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that, sometime in September 1996, Billy R. Everett retained respondent for $2,500
  to represent him in the criminal proceedings stemming from an arrest for aggravated battery.  It claims, although
  respondent enrolled as counsel of record for Mr. Everett on December 16, 1996, respondent failed to attend any
  scheduled court appearances on behalf of Mr. Everett and failed to communicate with him.  On January 22, 1997, less
  than five weeks after respondent enrolled as counsel, Mr. Everett filed a motion seeking to have respondent removed
  as his counsel. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these facts, the ODC alleges respondent's conduct violates Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (lack of diligence), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to
  communicate), <span class="allegedrules">1.5</span> (failure to account for and refund unearned fees), Rule
  <span class="allegedrules">1.15</span> (failure to safeguard client property),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> (failure to protect client interests upon termination of representation),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or
  misrepresentation) and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the
  administration of justice) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count II - Guiden Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that, on June 16, 1997, Michael Guiden retained respondent for $2,500.  Mr.
  Guiden, who had pled guilty to distribution of drugs and had been sentenced to five years incarceration, sought to
  withdraw his guilty plea and to obtain a lesser sentence of probation.  It claims respondent performed little or no
  work on Mr. Guiden's behalf, failed to inform him he had been suspended on June 13, 1997 by order of this court in
  <i>Edwards I</i>, failed to account for his fee and failed to refund the unearned portion of the fee.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these facts, the ODC alleges respondent's conduct violates Rules 1.3 (lack of
  diligence), 1.4 (failure to communicate), 1.5 (failure to account for and refund unearned fees), 1.15 (failure to
  safeguard client property), 1.16(d) (failure to protect client interests upon termination of representation), 8.4(a)
  (violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct), 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving deceit,
  dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation) and 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of
  justice) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count III - Brown Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that, on or about July 1, 1997, Jesse Brown paid respondent $2,000 in cash to
  represent Mr. Brown's brother, Darrien Brown, in criminal proceedings.<a name="_ftnref1" class="fn" href="#_ftn1"
  id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>  It claims, at the time respondent accepted the representation, he had been on interim
  suspension in <i>Edwards I</i> since June 13, 1997 and notice of this  interim suspension had been  published in
  respondent's local newspaper on June 25, 1997.  According to the ODC, respondent failed to advise Mr. Brown of his
  suspension, performed little or no work on his client's behalf,  failed to account for his fee or refund the unearned
  portion of his fee.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges  respondent's conduct violates Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.1</span>
  (incompetence), 1.3 (lack of diligence), 1.4 (failure to communicate), 1.5 (failure to account for and refund
  unearned fees), 1.15 (failure to safeguard client property), 1.16(d) (failure to protect client interests upon
  termination of representation), 8.4(a) (violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(b)</span> (commission of a criminal act adversely reflecting on a lawyer's honesty,
  trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or
  misrepresentation) and 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count IV - Hill Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that, on June 25, 1997, Alma Hill paid respondent $700 of a $2,000 fee to
  represent her daughter, Monica Hill, in a criminal matter.  It claims, after receiving the fee, respondent did little
  or nothing on his client's behalf and abandoned her.  Further, the ODC asserts respondent failed to communicate with
  Ms. Hill or his client, failed to inform them of his interim suspension in <i>Edwards I</i>, failed to account for
  his fee and failed to return the unearned portion of the fee.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges respondent's conduct violates Rules 1.4 (failure to communicate), 1.5 (failure to
  account for and refund unearned fees), 1.15 (failure to safeguard client property; i.e., commingling and conversion),
  1.16(d) (failure to protect client interests upon termination of representation), 8.4(a) (violating or attempting to
  violate the Rules of Professional Conduct), 8.4(b) (commission of a criminal act adversely reflecting on a lawyer's
  honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud,
  or misrepresentation) and 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) of the Rules of
  the Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count V - Giles Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that, in February 1997, Frederick D. Giles paid respondent $1,000 to represent
  him in criminal proceedings.  Respondent enrolled as Mr. Giles' counsel of record.  Subsequently, on June 1, 1997,
  respondent was placed on interim suspension in <i>Edwards I</i>.  Further, the ODC claims respondent failed to advise
  Mr. Giles of the interim suspension, failed to appear at court on his behalf, failed to account for his fee and
  failed to return the unearned portion of his fee.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges respondent's conduct violates Rules 1.4 (failure to communicate), 1.5 (failure to
  account for and refund unearned fees), 1.15 (failure to safeguard client property), 1.16(d) (failure to protect
  client interests upon termination of representation), 8.4(a) (violating or attempting to violate the Rules of
  Professional Conduct) and 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count VI - Failure to Cooperate Matters</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that, in each of the matters charged in  Counts I through V, the ODC forwarded
  copies of the complaints to respondent by certified mail and asked that he address the allegations made by the
  complainants.  Respondent failed to reply to this request.  As a result, the ODC alleges it was required to issue a
  subpoena compelling respondent's appearance and production of documents at a scheduled deposition.  The ODC
  recognizes respondent eventually appeared on October 21, 1997 to give a sworn statement in these matters.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges respondent's actions violates Rules <span class="allegedrules">8.1</span> and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which set forth the obligation of an
  attorney to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation.</p>

  <h2><span class="CITE"><a href="../HC/2002-06-26_00-DB-115.htm">FACTUAL FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE HEARING
  COMMITTEE</a></span></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After the ODC instituted formal charges, respondent filed an answer denying the misconduct and
  the matter proceeded to a formal hearing before the committee.<a name="_ftnref2" class="fn" href="#_ftn2"
  id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>  Respondent appeared at the hearing and was represented by counsel.  The ODC presented
  testimony from the complainants, as well as documentary evidence.  Respondent testified on his own behalf and called
  witnesses.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the Everett matter, the committee found respondent received a fee of $2,500 on behalf of Mr.
  Everett.  After receiving the fee, respondent made one court appearance on behalf of Mr. Everett, made no filings
  whatsoever on his behalf and was discharged several weeks later.  The committee found respondent made no effort to
  refund the unearned fee at the time of his discharge, although he testified a refund was made at a later date.  The
  committee also determined that respondent failed to reply to the ODC's request for information concerning Mr.
  Everett's complaint.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Regarding the Guiden matter, the committee determined respondent received a fee of $2,500 to
  perform certain criminal work for Mr. Guiden, but performed little or no work and did not refund the unearned portion
  of the fee.  The committee rejected respondent's testimony that he earned the fee by spending over twenty hours
  reviewing the record, finding this testimony was not credible.  The committee also found respondent failed to reply
  to the ODC's letter requesting information about Mr. Guiden's complaint.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As to the Brown matter, the committee determined respondent received a fee in the sum of $2,000,
  did little or no work on behalf of his client and failed to refund the unearned portion of the fee he
  received.<a name="_ftnref3" class="fn" href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>  The committee further made a finding of
  fact, based on testimony from Jessie Brown, Jr., that respondent received the fee on July 1, 1997, after respondent
  received notice of his interim suspension in <i>Edwards I</i>.<a name="_ftnref4" class="fn" href="#_ftn4"
  id="_ftnref4">[4]</a>  Additionally, it found he failed to respond to the ODC's requests for information.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the Hill matter, the committee found respondent received $700 of a $2,000 fee, did little or
  no work for his client and failed to refund the unearned portion of his fee.  The committee also found respondent
  failed to notify his client that he had been suspended from the practice of law and failed to respond to the ODC's
  request for information about the complaint.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As to the Giles matter, the committee found respondent received a fee in the amount of $1,000
  from Mr. Giles.  It determined he made two appearances in the matter, namely, one to enroll as counsel and one to
  waive the preliminary examination and enter a plea of not guilty on behalf of Mr. Giles.  It found respondent made no
  effort to refund the unearned portion of the fee to Mr. Giles, nor did he respond to the letter from the ODC
  requesting information about the complaint.  However, it concluded respondent notified Mr. Giles of his suspension
  from the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, the committee discussed the issue of whether respondent
  made restitution to his clients.  The committee observed respondent made no restitution in the Hill and Giles
  matters.  It found there was "uncorroborated testimony" from respondent that he returned some or all of the fee in
  the Everett and Guiden matters and had refunded the fee in the Brown matter the week prior  to the hearing.  However,
  the committee gave little weight to the payment of restitution, concluding the refunds of the fees "were prompted not
  by a sense of duty on part of the respondent but rather he was responding to the pressure of the disciplinary
  proceeding."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">It found respondent's decision to accept representation of the Brown matter on July 1, 1997,
  eighteen days after he had been placed on interim suspension in <i>Edwards I,</i> constituted "egregious
  misconduct."  Additionally, the committee found respondent's misconduct demonstrated a pattern of misconduct, which
  the committee found disturbing in light of his prior disciplinary record.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The only mitigating factor found by the committee was that respondent suffered from "certain
  personal difficulties" during the time frame of the misconduct.  However, the committee did not elaborate on the
  nature of these "personal difficulties."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on its consideration of the case, the committee recommended that respondent be disbarred
  from the practice of law.</p>

  <h2><span class="CITE"><a href="../DB/2003-07-31_00-DB-115.htm">RECOMMENDATION OF THE DISCIPLINARY
  BOARD</a></span></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board found most of the hearing committee's factual findings were supported by
  the record.  However, it determined the committee's conclusion that respondent failed to make restitution in the
  Giles matter was manifestly erroneous.  In support, the board relied on respondent's testimony that he refunded $500
  to Mr. Giles prior to the hearing, and the fact his statement was not challenged by the ODC during its
  cross-examination of respondent.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board also found no error in the legal conclusions of the committee.<a name="_ftnref5"
  class="fn" href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>  It pointed out the hearing committee did not find specific violations
  of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  However, it concluded the committee's findings supported a violation of Rule
  1.3, based on respondent's lack of diligence in the Everett, Guiden, Brown and Hill matters.  The board also found he
  failed to communicate with his clients in the Guiden, Brown, Hill and Giles matters in violation of Rule 1.4, as he
  failed to advise them of his suspension.  It determined respondent's failure to provide any meaningful services for
  his clients in the Brown and Hill matters demonstrated he lacked competence, in violation of Rule 1.1.  The board
  asserted respondent violated Rule 1.5(f)(6) and Rule 1.16(d) by failing to return the unearned fees until after
  disciplinary proceedings had been commenced.  It concluded his practice of law while suspended constituted a criminal
  act in violation of Rule 8.4(b).<a name="_ftnref6" class="fn" href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>  The board noted
  respondent's acts as a whole constituted dishonest or deceitful conduct and conduct prejudicial to the administration
  of justice under Rule 8.4(c) and (d).  Finally, it recognized respondent's failure to cooperate violated Rules 8.1
  and 8.4(g).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Addressing the issue of sanctions, the board determined that respondent's conduct was knowing and
  intentional, and that he violated duties owed to his clients, the profession, the public and the legal system.  It
  noted that respondent delayed his clients' legal matters by repeatedly failing to perform legal services for them. 
  The board also recognized that respondent deprived his clients of their funds for substantial periods of time, and
  had still not made restitution to Alma Hill.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the board recognized respondent's prior disciplinary record, dishonest or
  selfish motive, pattern of misconduct, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary process by intentionally failing to
  comply with the rules or orders of a disciplinary authority, refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of misconduct,
  vulnerability of the victims and substantial experience in the practice of law.<a name="_ftnref7" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a>  In mitigation, the board acknowledged the death of respondent's mother and his
  problems with his son.  However, without citing reasons, it declined to recognize his problems stemming from his
  criminal charges and financial difficulties.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Relying on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> and jurisprudence from this
  court, the board recommended respondent be disbarred from the practice of law. Further, it proposed respondent make
  restitution in the Hill matter and provide accountings to those clients who did not receive full refunds.  One board
  member filed a concurrence.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an objection to the recommendation of the disciplinary board.  Accordingly, the
  matter was docketed for briefing and argument in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 11(G).</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court.  La. Const. art. V,
  &sect; 5(B).  Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence.  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Quaid</i>,
  94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), 646 So. 2d 343</span>; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall</i>, 597
  So. 2d  444 (La. 1992)</span>.  While we are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing
  committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual
  findings.  <i>See</i> <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Caulfield</i>,  96-1401 (La. 11/25/96),
  <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La.
  3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The record  supports the hearing committee's factual findings that respondent neglected his
  clients' legal matters, failed to communicate with his clients, failed to  account for and refund the unearned fees
  in a timely fashion and failed to cooperate with the ODC.  Additionally, we find respondent engaged in the
  unauthorized practice of law by accepting representation in the Brown matter after he had notice he had been placed
  on interim suspension in <i>Edwards I</i>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional misconduct, we now turn to a discussion of the appropriate discipline. 
  We are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public,
  preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct.  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Reis</i>, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.  The discipline to be
  imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any
  aggravating and mitigating circumstances.  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As stated earlier, in <i>Edwards II</i>, we suspended respondent for a period of three  years,
  which was made retroactive to the June 13, 1997 interim suspension imposed in <i>Edwards I. </i> The instant charges
  arise in the same general time frame as the misconduct which formed the basis for <i>Edwards II.</i>  In
  <i><span class="CITE">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain</span></i><span class="CITE">,
  <a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 So. 2d 470</a> (La. 1991)</span>, we explained that, when a second
  disciplinary proceeding against an attorney involves misconduct which occurred during the same time period as the
  first proceeding, the overall discipline to be imposed should be determined as if both proceedings were before the
  court simultaneously.<a name="_ftnref8" class="fn" href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Had the instant misconduct been considered together with the misconduct at issue in <i>Edwards
  II</i>, it is likely that we would have disbarred respondent.  However, the difficulty of applying the
  <i>Chatelain</i> approach is readily apparent under the facts of this case.  It is logically impossible for us to
  impose a "retroactive" disbarment on respondent, especially considering respondent has served his suspension in
  <i>Edwards II</i>  and has been eligible to seek reinstatement from that suspension since June 13, 2000.  On the
  other hand, imposing a "new" disbarment on respondent at this time would be offensive to the principles of
  <i>Chatelain</i>, as it would expose respondent to a greater sanction based on the timing of the ODC's filing of
  formal charges.<a name="_ftnref9" class="fn" href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a> </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these unique circumstances, we must fashion a sanction which is responsive to the instant
  misconduct, giving due consideration to the fact that respondent should not be unfairly penalized due to the timing
  of the filing of the formal charges.  We conclude the appropriate sanction is a three-year suspension from the
  practice of law.  Two years of this suspension shall run concurrent to the suspension imposed in <i>Edwards II</i>
  and one year shall run consecutively to the suspension imposed in <i>Edwards II</i>, to commence upon the finality of
  the instant judgment.<a name="_ftnref10" class="fn" href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is ordered that Barry E. Edwards, Louisiana Bar Roll number
  5281, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of three years. Two years of this suspension shall run
  concurrently to the suspension imposed in <i>In re: Edwards</i>, 99-1783 (La. 12/17/99), 752 So. 2d 801, and one year
  shall run consecutively, to commence upon finality of the judgment rendered this day.  It is further ordered that
  respondent shall render accountings to his clients and refund any unearned fees due to them.  All costs and expenses
  in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10.1, with legal interest
  to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn1" class="fn" href="#_ftnref1" id="_ftn1">[1]</a>  Respondent maintains Mr.
  Brown retained him on June 1, 1997, rather than July 1, 1997.  However, the hearing committee made a finding of fact,
  based on Mr. Brown's bank records, that respondent was retained on July 1, 1997.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn2" class="fn" href="#_ftnref2" id="_ftn2">[2]</a>  Prior to a formal hearing in
  the case, respondent filed a petition for consent discipline, admitting he engaged in the alleged misconduct.  For
  his misconduct, respondent proposed a two-year suspension, with fifteen months deferred, followed by a two-year
  period of probation.  This court rejected the petition for consent discipline.  <i>In re: Edwards</i>, 00-1751 (La.
  8/31/00), 766 So. 2d 1269.  Accordingly, the matter proceeded to a formal hearing.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn3" class="fn" href="#_ftnref3" id="_ftn3">[3]</a>  The committee indicated it
  was "concerned" that the complainant in this matter was Jessie Brown,  rather than the client, Darrien Brown.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn4" class="fn" href="#_ftnref4" id="_ftn4">[4]</a>  Respondent maintained he
  received the fee on June 1, 1997, prior to receiving notice of his suspension on  June 25, 1997.  However, Mr. Brown
  testified he retained respondent on July 1, 1997.  In support of Mr. Brown's testimony, the ODC produced bank records
  reflecting that Mr. Brown withdrew $2,000 on July 1, 1997.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn5" class="fn" href="#_ftnref5" id="_ftn5">[5]</a>  The board discussed the
  committee's concern that the complaint in the Brown matter was made by Jesse Brown Jr. rather than the client,
  Darrien Brown.  See note 3, <i>supra</i>. The board found the Rules of Professional Conduct provided several
  instances where a client could have a professional obligation to a person other than the client.  The board also
  suggested that fairness dictated that Jesse Brown, the person who paid the fee, would be entitled to the refund when
  the representation ended prematurely.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn6" class="fn" href="#_ftnref6" id="_ftn6">[6]</a>  The board observed that La.
  R.S. 37:213 made the unauthorized practice of law a criminal offense.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn7" class="fn" href="#_ftnref7" id="_ftn7">[7]</a>  Respondent was admitted to
  the practice of law in 1974.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn8" class="fn" href="#_ftnref8" id="_ftn8">[8]</a>  In <i> Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Chatelain</i>, 573 So. 2d 470 (La. 1991), we declined to impose an additional disbarment on a
  previously-disbarred attorney based on conduct which occurred during the same time frame as the earlier disbarment. 
  We observed:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">Since the attorney-respondent cannot control the timing of the institution of disciplinary
    proceedings, it is generally inappropriate to disbar a previously disbarred attorney an additional time when the
    violations at issue occurred before or concurrently with the violations which resulted in the initial disbarment. 
    When a second disciplinary proceeding against an attorney involves misconduct which occurred during the same time
    period as the first proceeding, the overall discipline to be imposed should be determined as if both proceedings
    were before the court simultaneously.  See 1 Lawyers' Manual on Professional Conduct 466 (1984);  <i>Matter of
    Thompson</i>, 492 A.2d 866 (D.C.App.1985).</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn9" class="fn" href="#_ftnref9" id="_ftn9">[9]</a>  While we ascribe no improper
  motive to the ODC with regard to the timing of the filing of the formal charges, we observe that the underlying facts
  of the instant charges should have been known to the ODC during the time <i>Edwards II</i> was pending.  In support,
  we note that respondent gave his sworn statement in the instant case in October 1997.  Approximately five months
  later, in March 1998, the ODC amended its formal charges in <i>Edwards II</i>.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn10" class="fn" href="#_ftnref10" id="_ftn10">[10]</a>  The effect of our
  judgment is that respondent must serve a one-year actual suspension prior to seeking reinstatement from the
  suspension imposed in <i>Edwards II.</i></p>
