  joint petition for consent discipline. In that petition, the parties stipulate that respondent's conduct violates
  Rules <span class="Rules">1.7(b)</span> (engaging in a conflict of interest by representing a client where the
  representation may be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client or third person or by the
  lawyer's own interests) and <span class="Rules">1.9(a)</span> (engaging in a conflict of interest by representing
  another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person's interests are materially adverse
  to the interests of a former client) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  As a sanction, they proposed respondent
  be  publicly reprimanded and be required to attend Ethics School.  Having reviewed the petition for consent
  discipline,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that Richmond C. Odom, Louisiana Bar Roll number 17339, be and he hereby is
  publicly reprimanded for his misconduct in this matter.  It is further ordered that respondent attend Ethics School. 
  All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
