  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-1553</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: GEORGE E. DOWNING</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, George E. Downing, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In July 2002, respondent enrolled as counsel of record for Timothy Martin ("Timothy") in an
  ongoing child custody and visitation matter entitled Timothy Martin v. Debra Milton Martin, No. 34,222 on the docket
  of the 18th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Pointe Coupee. Timothy's ex-wife, Debra Martin ("Debra"), was
  represented in the matter by attorney Paula Hartley Clayton.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">By court order, Timothy and Debra shared joint legal custody of their two children. The joint
  custody plan granted domiciliary custody of the children to Debra and specific visitation rights to Timothy. On
  August 19, 2002, respondent filed an ex parte Motion for Civil Warrant on Timothy's behalf, alleging that Debra was
  refusing to allow Timothy to exercise his visitation rights. The court issued the civil warrant on August 30, 2002,
  ordering law enforcement authorities to "enforce the visitation rights of Timoth [sic] Martin and his minor
  children." At approximately 10:00 p.m. that evening, Timothy went to Debra's residence with two police officers to
  advise her of the civil warrant and enforce his visitation rights; however, the children did not wish to go with
  their father and the officers did not force them to do so.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Thereafter, Timothy falsely informed respondent that Debra had refused to allow the children to
  go with him. Without verifying Timothy's assertions, respondent filed an ex parte Motion and Order for Arrest of
  Party, requesting that the court issue a warrant for Debra's arrest due to her alleged failure to comply with the
  civil warrant. The motion was supported by Timothy's affidavit attesting that Debra had refused to allow the children
  to go with him when the civil warrant was presented. On September 10, 2002, without a hearing, the court issued a
  bench warrant ordering Debra's arrest. Debra was arrested at her place of employment in Iberville Parish at
  approximately 4:00 p.m. that day and spent almost twenty-four hours in jail before the court vacated the warrant on
  September 11, 2002.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After Debra was released from jail, Ms. Clayton filed a complaint against respondent with the
  ODC, alleging misconduct on respondent's part due to his filing of the ex parte motions without service or notice to
  her or Debra. She also pointed out numerous defects and misrepresentations in respondent's motions, and contended
  that his "ill practices, lack of diligence and unprofessionalism" had resulted in Debra's spending nearly twenty-four
  hours in jail.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In response to the complaint, respondent stated that Timothy told him that Debra had prevented
  him from exercising his visitation rights despite a court order. Respondent contacted Ms. Hartley concerning the
  matter, and she informed him that she was having difficulty reaching her client and was considering withdrawing from
  the representation. Respondent then consulted another attorney for advice on how to proceed, and was advised that a
  civil warrant could be utilized. Timothy later signed a sworn affidavit stating that Debra had refused to honor the
  civil warrant. Considering that a court order had been "openly refused," as well as Timothy's sworn affidavit,
  respondent presented the Motion and Order for Arrest of Party to the trial judge for consideration. Following Debra's
  arrest, respondent learned that Debra had not refused to honor the civil warrant, but that the children had expressed
  a desire not to leave with their father. Respondent confronted Timothy with this information, and in turn, Timothy
  admitted to respondent that he may have been "mistaken" in stating that Debra refused to let the children go with
  him. Respondent indicated that he apologized to Ms. Clayton for the entire incident.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent subsequently provided the ODC with a sworn statement. Respondent reiterated that when
  he filed the two motions, he believed Debra was an unrepresented party, even though he had not received notice that
  Ms. Clayton had withdrawn as Debra's counsel. He also stated that this was the first time he had encountered a
  situation wherein a party refused to comply with a court's visitation order. As such, he consulted another attorney,
  who advised him to utilize the civil warrant. When the civil warrant did not work to enforce the visitation,
  respondent again consulted the attorney, who advised him to seek Debra's arrest for her failure to comply with the
  civil warrant. Respondent conceded that he did not attempt to verify with the police officers that Debra had refused
  to allow the children to leave with Timothy. Instead, he relied entirely on Timothy's version of events.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent admitted that the most common approach to a party's failure to comply with a
  visitation order is to file a rule for contempt and hold a hearing, whether or not the party is represented by
  counsel. He also agreed that because of the process he followed, Debra was jailed without the benefit of a hearing.
  Respondent further indicated this was the first time he had a party arrested for failure to comply with a visitation
  order but assured the ODC that if similar situations should arise in the future, he would only utilize rules for
  contempt.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Finally, respondent implied that he had done nothing wrong because the judge who signed the order
  for Debra's arrest had reviewed the motion and had not denied it for being improper.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Following its investigation, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent,
  alleging that his conduct in the Martin matter violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.1(a)</span> (failure to
  provide competent representation to a client) and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct
  prejudicial to the administration of justice) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent answered the formal
  charges, essentially denying the allegations of misconduct.</p>

  <h3>Formal Hearing</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This matter proceeded to a formal hearing on the merits, at which respondent and Debra testified.
  The parties also filed a joint stipulation concerning the testimony of Ms. Clayton and attorney Sydney Picou. The
  stipulation indicated that Ms. Clayton was Debra's counsel of record from May 1999 until 2003, but nevertheless,
  respondent did not provide Ms. Clayton with notice of the civil warrant or of the motion and order for Debra's
  arrest. The stipulation also indicated that Ms. Picou was retained to represent Debra immediately following her
  arrest on September 10, 2002 and continues to represent Debra in the domestic matter.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">At the hearing, respondent testified that he communicated with Ms. Clayton and sent her a copy of
  his motion to enroll as Timothy's counsel, as well as a motion to set a status conference and rule date. However, Ms.
  Clayton subsequently informed respondent that she was having trouble contacting Debra, and that she may withdraw from
  the representation. Thereafter, when respondent requested the issuance of a warrant for Debra's arrest, he did not
  provide Ms. Clayton with notice. Respondent testified that he personally took the motion to the judge's office and
  left it for her review and signature, though he admitted he did not speak with the judge about the motion.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Debra testified that she never violated the visitation order, as Timothy alleged. In fact, they
  met every two weeks so that Timothy could pick up the children for weekend visits pursuant to the visitation plan.
  However, on one occasion, Timothy failed to show up at the designated time and location, and on another occasion, he
  picked up the children for a weekend visit and kept them for three weeks.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Because of the latter incident, Debra believed Timothy's visitation rights had been suspended.
  Nonetheless, when Timothy arrived with the police and the civil warrant on August 30, 2002, she invited the officers
  in to wait while she told her children they had to go with Timothy. When the children indicated they did not want to
  go with their father, one of the officers spoke with the children, who again indicated they did not want to go. The
  officers then left without taking the children.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">When Debra was later arrested, she stated that she was fingerprinted, had her mug shot taken, had
  to change into a prison uniform, and was placed into a cell with seven other inmates. She stayed in jail for
  twenty-three and a half hours. Debra described her imprisonment as a "living nightmare" and a "horrible experience."
  She was worried about her children and embarrassed about being arrested at her place of employment. She further
  indicated that her employment required a background check every five years, and the arrest caused repercussions in
  that her employer had to verify she had not violated the law. In August 2003, Debra filed a civil suit against
  Timothy and respondent, seeking damages for false arrest.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-09-10_03-DB-065.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After considering this matter, the hearing committee made factual findings as follows:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's Motion for Civil Warrant, filed on August 19, 2002, did not indicate a copy was
  served upon or mailed to Ms. Clayton or Debra, nor was a hearing held. Furthermore, respondent admitted that he did
  not provide Ms. Clayton or Debra with a copy of the motion and admitted that he obtained the civil warrant on an ex
  parte basis.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On August 27, 2002, respondent filed a motion to set a status conference and also asked the court
  to re-fix for hearing pending issues of contempt of court, visitation, and custody, which had previously been passed
  or continued by the court. The motion contained a certificate indicating respondent mailed a copy of same to all
  counsel of record.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On August 30, 2002, police officers went to Debra's residence with Timothy to enforce the civil
  warrant. After speaking with the children, the officers did not enforce the warrant because the children did not want
  to go with their father. As such, Timothy's efforts to utilize the civil warrant to enforce his visitation rights
  failed.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On September 10, 2002, respondent filed a Motion and Order for Arrest of Party, in which he
  represented to the court that Debra would not release the children on August 30, 2002. The motion requested the
  issuance of a warrant for Debra's arrest for her failure to comply with the civil warrant. The motion contained no
  certification that it was forwarded to Debra's counsel. The court issued a bench warrant for Debra's arrest the same
  day respondent filed the motion. Respondent admitted he obtained the arrest warrant on an ex parte basis. The same
  day the bench warrant was issued, Debra was arrested at her place of employment in Iberville Parish and held as a
  fugitive from Pointe Coupee Parish. She was booked, fingerprinted, photographed, and placed into a jail uniform. She
  was also put into a cell with seven other inmates and stayed in prison for approximately twenty-three and a half
  hours. On September 11, 2002, the court executed an order vacating the previous warrants and ordering the police to
  assist in the return of the children to Debra.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these factual findings and considering La. R.S. 9:343,<a name="fnref1" class="fn"
  href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a> the hearing committee determined that respondent did not have the authority to obtain
  the ex parte civil warrant. The representations in the motion and the attached affidavit by Timothy were contrary to
  the statute's provisions, and respondent knew or should have known Timothy was not entitled to utilize a civil
  warrant under the circumstances of the case.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee also determined that respondent's motion seeking Debra's arrest was improper
  because it was based on her failure to comply with the civil warrant. However, the civil warrant was directed not to
  Debra but to law enforcement agencies. Even if the civil warrant had been appropriate in the first instance, the
  representations in respondent's motion were inappropriate, inaccurate, and misleading.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Finally, the committee determined that there is no legal authority which allows a party to obtain
  an arrest warrant of his or her opponent on an ex parte basis. Rather, the appropriate method to enforce a court
  order is through contempt proceedings. Pursuant to La. Code Civ. P. art. 225,<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2"
  id="fnref2">2</a> Debra could only be found in contempt of court after notice and an evidentiary hearing wherein she
  had the opportunity to defend herself. The ex parte nature of the motion for arrest violated the due process mandate
  of the United States and Louisiana Constitutions.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these findings, the committee concluded that respondent violated Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.1(a)</span> and <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The
  committee determined that respondent acted negligently but harmed Debra by facilitating her arrest and harmed Timothy
  by exposing him to a civil claim for damages for Debra's wrongful arrest. According to the ABA's Standards for
  Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is a public reprimand.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Aggravating factors found by the committee were <span class="ABAstandard">refusal to acknowledge
  the wrongful nature of the conduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the victim</span>, and
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span> (admitted 1988). The committee also
  took into account two prior disciplinary complaints filed against respondent, which were later dismissed by the ODC.
  Finally, the committee noted respondent's lack of remorse.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a>
  In mitigation, the committee found the absence of a serious prior disciplinary record, absence of a dishonest or
  selfish motive, and full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board and a cooperative attitude toward the
  proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, the committee recommended that respondent be publicly reprimanded.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2005-06-02_03-DB-065.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing this matter, the disciplinary board determined that the hearing committee's
  factual findings are not manifestly erroneous. The board found that respondent improperly obtained both the civil
  warrant and the arrest warrant on an ex parte basis. Respondent's use of La. R.S. 9:343 to obtain the civil warrant
  was contrary to the dictates of the law. He relied upon the statute in circumstances involving parents with joint
  custody when the statute only applies to circumstances in which a custodial parent seeks to obtain the return of his
  or her children from a non-custodial parent. Furthermore, respondent failed to provide notice of the filing of the
  motion to Debra or her counsel, Ms. Clayton.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board also found that the motion for Debra's arrest was based on inaccurate and misleading
  allegations. In the motion, respondent represented to the court that Debra failed to honor the civil warrant and
  would not release the children to Timothy. This representation was misleading in that it was the police officers who
  did not enforce the warrant after speaking with the children who indicated that they did not want to leave with their
  father. Once again, respondent failed to provide Debra or Ms. Clayton with notice of the filing of this motion.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Additionally, the board agreed with the committee's finding that the appropriate method to
  enforce the joint custody plan is through contempt proceedings, not through the use of La. R.S. 9:343 or a motion to
  arrest a party. The board also agreed with the committee that the ex parte nature of the motion for arrest violated
  the due process mandate of the United States and Louisiana Constitutions.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Finally, the board found that respondent's preparation for filing the two motions consisted of
  calling another attorney and receiving advice from that attorney on how to proceed. The board determined that
  respondent's reliance on the advice he received was clearly misplaced and caused significant injury to Debra.
  Respondent violated Rule 1.1(a) because he failed to provide competent representation to Timothy. Moreover, by
  obtaining the civil and arrest warrants in an ex parte and improper manner, respondent violated Rule 8.4(d). As a
  result of respondent's actions, Debra was denied her right to due process and was unjustly incarcerated.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board determined that respondent violated duties owed to his client, the public (namely
  Debra), and the legal system. He acted negligently but caused very significant actual injury in the form of Debra's
  unjust incarceration without the benefit of due process. Furthermore, Debra was arrested at her place of employment,
  a security-sensitive strategic petroleum reserve, which could have easily jeopardized her employment. Finally,
  respondent's actions caused Timothy to be sued by Debra for wrongful arrest.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the board identified respondent's refusal to acknowledge the wrongful
  nature of the conduct, vulnerability of the victim, substantial experience in the practice of law, and lack of
  remorse. The board noted that the hearing committee erred in finding the aggravating factor of
  <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary offenses</span>, based upon respondent's two prior dismissed
  disciplinary complaints. As mitigating factors, the board found the absence of a prior disciplinary record, absence
  of a dishonest or selfish motive, and full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board and a cooperative attitude
  toward the proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, the board looked to this court's prior jurisprudence and
  noted that violations of Rules 1.1(a) and 8.4(d) generally warrant brief suspensions, especially when numerous
  aggravating factors are present. Considering <span class="cite">In re: Young, 03-0274 (La. 6/27/03),
  <a href="2003-06-27_2003-0274.htm">849 So. 2d 25</a></span>,<a name="fnref4" class="fn" href="#fnref4"
  id="fnref4">4</a> but noting that the instant matter involves only one count of misconduct, the board recommended
  that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for three months, fully deferred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation;
  however, the court on its own motion docketed the matter for briefing and oral argument in accordance with Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, § 11(G)(1)(a).</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316
  (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in
  any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the
  manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings. See <span class="cite">In re: Caulfield,
  96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class="cite">In re:
  Pardue, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The formal charges allege, and we agree, that respondent acted incompetently in filing ex parte
  motions for a civil warrant and arrest of Debra. The record as a whole suggests that respondent's actions were
  negligent, resulting from his lack of understanding of the relevant procedures in custody cases, and were not the
  result of any improper motive. Nonetheless, respondent's failure to research the law resulted in the improper arrest
  of Debra and exposed Timothy to a lawsuit by his ex-wife. We find that respondent's conduct violated Rule 1.1(a) of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct and was prejudicial to the administration of justice, in violation of Rule
  8.4(d).<a name="fnref5" class="fn" href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found evidence of professional misconduct, we now turn to a determination of the
  appropriate sanction for respondent's actions. In considering that issue, we are mindful that disciplinary
  proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the
  profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis,
  <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The jurisprudence of this court indicates that a short suspension is the appropriate discipline
  for failure to render competent representation. See, e.g., In re: Young, 03-0274 (La. 6/27/03),
  <a href="2003-06-27_2003-0274.htm">849 So. 2d 25</a> (attorney suspended for six months, with all but two months
  deferred, followed by six months of probation with conditions, for two counts of misconduct involving violations of
  Rules 1.1(a) and 8.4(d)). Unlike Young, which involved multiple counts of misconduct, the instant case involves only
  a single count. Considering this fact, as well as the aggravating and mitigating factors present, we find the board's
  recommended sanction of a fully deferred three-month suspension is not unreasonable.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will adopt the board's recommendation and suspend respondent from the practice of
  law for three months. We will defer this suspension in its entirety and place respondent on unsupervised probation
  for three months, subject to the condition that any misconduct during this period may be grounds for making the
  deferred suspension executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is ordered that George E. Downing, Louisiana Bar Roll
  number 18589, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of three months. It is further ordered that the
  suspension shall be deferred in its entirety and respondent shall be placed on unsupervised probation for three
  months, subject to the condition that any misconduct during this period may be grounds for making the deferred
  suspension executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate. All costs and expenses in the matter are
  assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty
  days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="footnotetext">The statute clearly does not apply to a visitation dispute between parents who have joint

    the "seedier aspects of family law" in attempting to justify his actions. However, the law is quite clear regarding
    the issuance of civil warrants and contempt proceedings to enforce visitation privileges and Respondent chose not
    to follow the law. It appears that Respondent wishes to place blame everywhere but on himself.</p>

    <p class="signature">Johnson, J. dissents and assigns reasons:</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">In my opinion, the professional misconduct herein requires an actual suspension from the
    practice of law.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Downing, without verifying his client's assertions, filed an Ex parte Motion and Order for
    the arrest of his client's spouse for failure to comply with the court's visitation order.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">Not only were the assertions false, but the complainant, Mrs. Debra Martin, suffered a very
    significant actual injury when pursuant to the bench warrant, she was arrested at her place of employment in
    Iberville Parish. She was then booked, fingerprinted, photographed and jailed as a fugitive from Pointe Coupee
    Parish, for twenty-three hours.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">Mrs. Martin was represented by counsel. Respondent suggests that he proceeded ex parte because
    Mrs. Martin's attorney, Paula Clayton, indicated that she would be withdrawing from the case.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">In my mind, Mrs. Martin was clearly entitled to be heard in a court before being humiliated in
    this fashion.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority's opinion which defers respondent's

    <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: GEORGE E. DOWNING</p>

    <p class="headingstyle">Attorney Disciplinary Proceedings</p>

    <p class="signature">WEIMER, J., concurring.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee and disciplinary board found lack of remorse as an aggravating factor. In
    brief, Mr. Downing argues as follows:</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">Exhibit ODC 3, dated October 16, 2002, notified Mr. Downing of the complaint, and contained
    within ODC's letter were citations to Rule 8.1(b) (c), 8.4(g), and Rule XIX, § 9C reminding Mr. Downing of his duty
    to respond to a "request for information". Clearly, Mr. Downing was obligated to offer an explanation of the events
    surrounding the complaint. It appears quite wrong to demand information, and then use that response as a basis for
    an aggravating factor and accuse him of trying to shift blame.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the record, I have a concern about a finding of lack of remorse as an
    aggravating factor in this matter. Counsel for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel candidly acknowledged a similar
    concern at oral argument.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">The record indicates Mr. Downing apologized to the attorney for Debra Martin and acknowledged
    in his sworn statement he should not have followed the procedures at issue and would not do so again in the
    future.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">A lack of remorse should not be applied whenever one offers an explanation or mounts a defense.
    A lack of remorse should be applied to those who truly lack remorse in the face of obvious wrongdoing. This can be
    a difficult distinction to make in some matters; however, that distinction must be made so that the aggravating
    factor of a lack of remorse is appropriately applied.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">This court's opinion does not specifically find a lack of remorse. Based on the record in this
    matter, I would reject a finding of a lack of remorse as an aggravating factor. I otherwise concur in the
    result.</p>
