  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-OB-1032</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: JOSEPH R. CASANOVA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ON APPLICATION FOR REINSTATEMENT</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This proceeding arises out of an application for reinstatement filed by petitioner, Joseph R.
  Casanova, an attorney who is currently suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <span class="cite">In re: Casanova, 02-2155 (La. 11/22/02),
  <a href="2002-11-22_2002-2155.htm">847 So. 2d 1169</a></span>, petitioner was suspended for eighteen months stemming
  from multiple counts of neglect of legal matters and failure to communicate involving several clients, as well as
  charges of failure to cooperate and the failure of petitioner to properly terminate the representation of his
  clients. Petitioner subsequently filed an application for reinstatement to the practice of law, asserting that he has
  complied with the reinstatement criteria set forth in Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(E). The Office of Disciplinary
  Counsel ("ODC") took no position concerning petitioner's reinstatement. Accordingly, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule
  XIX, § 24(F) and (G), the matter was referred for a formal hearing before a hearing committee.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After considering the evidence presented, the hearing committee recommended that petitioner be
  reinstated to the practice of law, subject to the condition that he be assigned a practice monitor. Neither
  petitioner nor the ODC objected to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board agreed that petitioner proved by clear and convincing evidence that he
  satisfies the criteria for reinstatement. The board also agreed that a period of supervised probation is appropriate
  to protect the public. Accordingly, the board recommended to this court that petitioner be reinstated to the practice
  of law, subject to an eighteen-month period of supervised probation. Neither petitioner nor the ODC objected to the
  disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Petitioner has served the eighteen-month suspension imposed by this court in 2002, and no
  objections were received to his application for reinstatement. After considering the record in its entirety, we find
  petitioner has met his burden of proving that he is entitled to be reinstated to the practice of law. Furthermore, we
  agree with the hearing committee and the disciplinary board that further precautions are warranted to insure that the
  public will be protected upon petitioner's return to practice. See Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(J). Accordingly, we
  will order that petitioner be conditionally reinstated, subject to an eighteen-month period of supervised probation.
  The terms of probation shall be set forth in writing and agreed to by all parties, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule
  XIX, Appendix C. Should petitioner fail to comply with the conditions of probation, or should he commit any
  misconduct during the period of probation, his conditional right to practice may be terminated immediately or he may
  be subjected to other discipline pursuant to the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, as appropriate.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Joseph R. Casanova, Louisiana Bar Roll number 18164, be immediately
  reinstated to the practice of law in Louisiana, subject to a probationary period of eighteen months. Should
  petitioner fail to comply with the conditions of probation, or should he commit any misconduct during the period of
  probation, his conditional right to practice may be terminated immediately or he may be subjected to other discipline
  pursuant to the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, as appropriate. All costs of these proceedings are
  assessed against petitioner.</p>
