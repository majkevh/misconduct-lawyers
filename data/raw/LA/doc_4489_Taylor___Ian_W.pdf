<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>

<p class="bodycopy">This matter arises 
from a petition for consent discipline filed by respondent, Ian W. Taylor, an 
attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<h3>Morris Matter</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">In October 1997, 
Doris Morris paid respondent $500 to handle a property dispute on her behalf. 
Respondent neglected the matter and failed to communicate with his client. In 
April 1998, in an effort to move the matter forward, Ms. Morris paid respondent 
an additional $150, to be used for filing fees. Nevertheless, respondent 
continued to neglect the matter and refused to communicate with his client. 
After Ms. Morris filed a complaint with the ODC concerning respondent’s handling 
of the matter, respondent refunded $500 in unearned legal fees to Ms. Morris.</p>
<h3>Griffen Matter</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">Ms. Griffen 
retained respondent and his wife<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn1"><font size="1">1</font></a></span> 
to handle a succession matter and a claim against the City of New Orleans for 
property damage. Thereafter, respondent abruptly closed his law office. Several 
months later, respondent sent Ms. Griffen a letter, informing her that his law 
office had been closed and listing a contact address. After several attempts to 
reach respondent, Ms. Griffen was eventually contacted by respondent’s wife, who 
promised Ms. Griffen that her files would be returned and that she would receive 
a refund of the legal fees she had paid. When several months went by and Ms. 
Griffen had not received either her files or her fees, she filed a complaint 
against respondent with the ODC.</p>
<h3>Lewis Matter</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">Trina Lewis paid 
respondent $500 to handle a bankruptcy matter on her behalf. Respondent 
neglected the matter and failed to communicate with his client, then abruptly 
closed his law office. After Ms. Lewis filed a complaint with the ODC concerning 
respondent’s handling of the matter, respondent refunded $500 in unearned legal 
fees to Ms. Lewis and returned her file.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">The ODC conducted 
an investigation into the complaints filed against respondent. However, prior to 
the institution of formal charges by the ODC, respondent filed a petition for 
consent discipline. In that petition, he admitted his conduct violated the 
following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.3 --#">1.3</a> (failure to act with diligence and 
promptness in representing a client), <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.4 --#">1.4</a> 
(failure to communicate with a client), <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.16 --#">1.16</a> 
(failure to protect a client’s interests upon termination of the 
representation), and <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE3.2 --#">3.2</a> (failure to make 
reasonable efforts to expedite litigation). For his misconduct, respondent 
proposed that he be suspended from the practice of law for one year, deferred, 
followed by one year of supervised probation with conditions.
<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn2"><font size="2">2</font></a></span></p>
<p class="bodycopy">In a stipulation 
of facts submitted with the petition for consent discipline,<a href="#fn3"><span style="vertical-align: super"><font size="1">3</font></span></a> 
respondent set forth several mitigating factors. He stated that he experienced 
personal problems which caused him to close his law practice. He also suggested 
that he had no dishonest or selfish motive, and pointed out that he has made 
good faith efforts at restitution. In addition, respondent pointed out that he 
has fully cooperated with the ODC in its investigation. With respect to 
aggravating factors, respondent acknowledged his prior disciplinary record, 
which consists of a 1998 admonition.<span style="vertical-align: super"><font size="1"><a href="#fn4">4</a></font></span></p>
<p class="bodycopy">The ODC concurred 
in the petition. Pointing out that respondent’s misconduct chiefly involved 
delay of legal matters and a lack of communication, the ODC suggested that a 
deferred suspension with supervised probation is appropriate in light of the 
facts and circumstances of this case. In particular, the ODC noted that the 
abrupt closure of respondent’s law office was due to his personal problems, and 
that he is currently residing in Tennessee, where he is not practicing law. The 
ODC concurred in the mitigating factors cited by respondent, and suggested three 
additional aggravating factors, including multiple offenses, substantial 
experience in the practice of law (admitted 1990), and vulnerability of the 
victims. Concluding that the proposed sanction will deter future misconduct and 
protect the public, the ODC urged that the petition for consent discipline be 
accepted.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- ID:01-DB-054.BD --">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="bodycopy">In its report, the 
disciplinary board found that respondent violated duties owed to his clients, 
and that his actions were knowing, if not intentional. The board found 
respondent’s clients were injured due to his lack of diligence, failure to 
communicate, and failure to protect their interests upon closing his law firm. 
While the record does not provide details as to the outcome of the clients’ 
legal matters, the board suggested the matters were unnecessarily delayed 
because of respondent’s misconduct. </p>
<p class="bodycopy">After reviewing 
the record, the board determined that one aggravating factor is present, namely 
respondent’s prior disciplinary record. The board agreed that respondent’s 
cooperative attitude toward the proceedings and his timely good faith efforts at 
restitution are mitigating factors. However, it refused to give any weight to 
the parties’ assertion that respondent’s personal problems and lack of dishonest 
or selfish motive should be considered in mitigation, citing a lack of support 
in the record for such a finding.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Relying on the 
ABA’s <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>
<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn5"><font size="1">5</font></a></span> 
and jurisprudence from this court <span style="vertical-align: super">
<a href="#fn6"><font size="1">6</font></a></span>, the board concluded that 
probation is an appropriate sanction in this case. In light of respondent’s full 
cooperation with the ODC’s investigation, the board suggested that the 
conditions of probation will adequately safeguard the public from any future 
harm caused by respondent. Therefore, the board found the proposed consent 
discipline is appropriate and recommended respondent be suspended from the 
practice of law for one year, deferred, followed by one year of supervised 
probation subject to the conditions proposed in the petition for consent 
discipline.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent 
nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board’s recommendation.</p>
<p align="center"><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p class="bodycopy">Although this 
matter arises from a petition for consent discipline, Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s20 --#">20</a>(B) provides that the extent of discipline to 
be imposed is subject to review. In determining an appropriate sanction, we are 
mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of 
conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter 
future misconduct. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The 
discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness 
of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">The record 
reflects that on two occasions, respondent accepted fees to handle legal 
matters, but thereafter failed to diligently pursue the matters. Respondent also 
failed to communicate with his clients concerning their matters or to timely 
notify them that he was closing his law firm. While there is no evidence in the 
record concerning the outcome of the Morris or Lewis matters, respondent’s 
neglect of these matters and his failure to communicate with his clients may 
have negatively affected his clients’ rights. Additionally, although respondent 
may not have had primary responsibility for handling Ms. Griffen’s file, he 
shared responsibility for ensuring that her legal matter was properly handled 
and that the law firm maintained reasonable communication with her. Respondent’s 
conduct in these three matters is a clear violation of the professional rules 
and warrants discipline.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Nevertheless, we 
agree that a deferred period of suspension, followed by supervised probation, is 
appropriate under the facts of this case. Respondent is no longer practicing law 
and has moved away from Louisiana, so there is little risk that he will cause 
any future harm to the public. Should he decide to resume his practice here in 
the future, he will be subject to the supervision of a probation monitor for a 
period of one year. Of course, in the event respondent fails to comply with the 
conditions of his probation, the court retains the right to revoke probation and 
to order respondent to serve the deferred period of suspension.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Based on these 
factors, we find the proposed consent discipline is appropriate under the 
circumstances. Accordingly, we will accept the petition for consent discipline.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the 
findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the 
record filed herein, it is ordered that Ian W. Taylor be suspended from the 
practice of law for one year. Said suspension shall be deferred, subject to a 
one-year period of supervised probation governed by the conditions set forth in 
the petition for consent discipline. All costs and expenses in the matter are 
assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s10.1 --#">10.1</a>, with legal interest to commence thirty 
days from the date of finality of this court’s judgment until<br>
paid.</p>
<hr noshade="" color="#000000" align="left" width="100" size="0">
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> During the period of time at issue, respondent practiced 
law with his wife, who is also an attorney. Respondent’s wife was primarily 
responsible for handling Ms. Griffen’s file.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> Respondent proposed the following conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
 <ol>
   <li>
   <p class="footnotetext">Respondent will respond to all reasonable requests of his probation 
   monitor.</li>
   <li>
   <p class="footnotetext">Respondent shall establish and maintain an effective calendaring system 
   and method to communicate with clients and shall obtain the assistance of the 
   LSBA Loss Prevention Counsel and the Louisiana State Bar Association’s 
   Practice Assistance Counsel in the creation of a proper law office management 
   program.</li>
   <li>
   <p class="footnotetext">Respondent shall remain current in the law during his period of probation 
   by satisfying all annual MCLE requirements of the<br>
   Louisiana State Bar Association in a timely fashion, pay all Louisiana State 
   Bar Association bar dues, and pay all Louisiana<br>
   Attorney Disciplinary Board disciplinary assessments imposed by the Louisiana 
   Supreme Court.</li>
   <li>
   <p class="footnotetext">Respondent will either return unearned fees or voluntarily participate in 
   the Louisiana State Bar Association Fee Resolution Program regarding fees 
   charged for him.</li>
   <li>
   <p class="footnotetext">Respondent agrees that any violation of any terms or conditions set forth 
   shall result in a summary revocation of probation and the immediate 
   imposition of the period of suspension deferred.</li>
 </ol>
</blockquote>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3 </a>Although the ODC did not concur in the stipulation of 
facts submitted by respondent, it has not objected to the stipulation.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> The nature of the misconduct in the admonition matter 
(98-ADB-064) was not specified in the petition for consent discipline. However, 
according to the disciplinary board, respondent engaged the services of a 
clinical psychologist on behalf of two clients, but failed to honor his written 
guarantee that he would be responsible for payment of these services. For this 
misconduct, respondent was admonished for engaging in conduct prejudicial to the 
administration of justice.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">5</a> Standard 4.42 provides that suspension is generally 
appropriate when a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for a client and 
causes injury or potential injury to a client.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn6">6</a> The board cited <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Vaughan</i>, 00-1892 (La. 
10/27/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:772%20So.2d%2087 --#">772 So. 2d 87</a> </span>(one year and 
one day suspension for an attorney who abandoned his law practice, neglected

investigation); <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Bivins</i>, 98-2513 (La. 12/11/98),

suspension for an attorney who neglected a legal matter, failed to communicate 
with his client, engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of 
justice, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation). The board 
noted, however, that respondent’s cooperation in the instant proceedings 
distinguishes this case from the cited cases and justifies the imposition of a 
lesser sanction than was imposed in those matters.</p>
