<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 02-B-1837</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: CLAUD EDWARD PHELPS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This matter arises from a petition for consent discipline 
submitted by respondent, Claud Edward Phelps, prior to the filing of formal 
charges by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”). </p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">This proceeding involves seven separate instances of 
misconduct. The facts, as stipulated to by the parties, are as follows:</p>
<h3>General Facts</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was admitted to the bar in 1992. During the time 
period at issue, he was employed by the law firm of Steven Rue and Associates. 
He has been disciplined on one prior occasion, receiving an admonition in 1999 
for failing to act with reasonable diligence, failing to communicate and failing 
to cooperate in the disciplinary investigation.</p>
<h3>Graham Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">David Allen Graham retained respondent in January, 1998 to 
represent him in a domestic matter. Although respondent filed pleadings in the 
case, he did not provide copies of those pleadings to his client or communicate 
with him about the status and progress of the case. The parties stipulated that 
part of the delay was due to the fact that the opposing party could not be 
served.</p>
<h3>Stuart Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Prior to her death in December, 1997, Patricia Stuart 
retained the law firm of Stephen Rue and Associates to handle her estate. The 
case was assigned to respondent shortly after Ms. Stuart’s death. Respondent 
failed to communicate with Ms. Stuart’s daughter, Joyce Haynes, or with the 
executor of the estate about the status of the case and failed to expedite 
resolution of the case. The parties stipulated that some of the delay resulted 
because out-of-state attorneys were involved in the matter.</p>
<h3>Weintrit Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In February, 1999, Melissa Weintrit retained respondent to 
represent her in a divorce case. Although respondent filed pleadings in the 
matter, he failed to adequately communicate with Ms. Weintrit about the status 
and progress of the case. Respondent also failed to appear in court with his 
client. However, the parties stipulated that Ms. Weintrit’s rights were not 
prejudiced by respondent’s actions.</p>
<h3>Rodrigue Matter </h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Roxanna Rodrigue retained the law firm of Stephen Rue and 
Associates to represent her in a domestic matter. The case was assigned to 
respondent. Ms. Rodrigue made respondent aware that the matter should be handled 
on an expedited basis because she was planning on going to Europe. Respondent 
failed to adequately communicate with Ms. Rodrigue or expedite the litigation as 
promised.</p>
<h3>Davis Matter </h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">May Davis retained respondent to represent her in a child 
custody matter. Although respondent had some contact with Ms. Davis, he failed 
to return her numerous phone calls or respond to her requests for information.</p>
<h3>LeBlanc Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In 1998, Mark G. LeBlanc retained Steven Rue and Associates 
to handle a divorce matter. The case was assigned to respondent. Although 
respondent had some contact with Mr. LeBlanc, he failed to return his phone 
calls or respond to his requests for information.</p>
<h3>Bertucci Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In 1998, John Bertucci retained Steven Rue and Associates to 
handle a divorce matter. The case was assigned to respondent. Although 
respondent had some contact with Mr. Bertucci, he failed to return his phone 
calls or respond to his correspondence. </p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Petition for Consent Discipline</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Prior to the filing of formal charges by the ODC, respondent 
submitted a petition for consent discipline.<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> In his 
petition, respondent stipulated to the facts and admitted his conduct violated 
the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rule 1.3 (failing 
to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), Rule 
1.4 (failure to communicate with a client) and Rule 3.2 (failure to make 
reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the 
client). As a sanction, respondent proposed that he be suspended from the 
practice of law for a period of one year and one day, but that this suspension 
be fully deferred and he be placed on supervised probation for a period of 
twenty-four months subject to conditions.<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC concurred in the petition for consent discipline. 
The ODC observed that respondent’s conduct caused frustration to his clients, 
but did not result in any permanent harm to them. In mitigation, it noted that 
all the complaints arose during a time when respondent was overwhelmed with 
work.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-079.BD --#">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on respondent’s admission of misconduct, the board 
found the sole issue before it was whether the proposed sanction was 
appropriate. Citing Standards 4.42 and 6.22 of the ABA’s Standards for Imposing 
Lawyer Discipline,<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> the board concluded the baseline sanction 
for respondent’s misconduct was a suspension. As aggravating facts it recognized 
respondent had a prior disciplinary record, engaged in a pattern of misconduct 
and multiple offenses, and his actions involved vulnerable victims. As 
mitigating factors, it found respondent had a cooperative attitude toward the 
proceedings, was inexperienced in the practice of law<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> and 
demonstrated remorse.<br>
Considering these factors, the board found the proposed consent discipline was 
appropriate and recommended it be accepted.<br>
Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board’s 
recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Although this matter arises from a petition for consent 
discipline, Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 20(B) provides that the extent of 
discipline to be imposed is subject to review. In determining an appropriate 
sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain 
high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the 
profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State 
Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> 
(La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each 
case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any 
aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State 
Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 
520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent’s neglect of client matters and failure to 
communicate with clients is conduct which falls well below the high ethical 
standard expected of attorneys licensed to practice law in this state. The 
baseline discipline for this misconduct is clearly a suspension from the 
practice of law. However, we recognize that respondent’s actions were the 
product of poor practice management skills rather than any dishonest or improper 
motive on his part. Under similar circumstances, this court has imposed deferred 
suspensions coupled with supervised probation. See <span class="CITE"><i>In re: 
Madera</i>, 99-3265 (La. 12/10/99), <a href="#!-- #ID:756%20So.2d%20282 --#">756 
So. 2d 282</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Horne</i>, 98-2514 (La. 
11/6/98), <a href="#!-- #ID:721%20So.2d%20846 --#">721 So. 2d 846</a></span>;
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Dunn</i>, 98-0760 (La. 9/18/98),
<a href="#!-- #ID:717%20So.2d%20639 --#">717 So. 2d 639</a></span>;
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Williams</i>, 98-0773 (La. 4/24/98),
<a href="#!-- #ID:709%20So.2d%20211 --#">709 So. 2d 211</a></span>. Such an 
approach gives the lawyer an opportunity to correct the problems which caused 
the misconduct, while at the same time protecting the public from future 
misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the petition for consent 
discipline, and impose a fully deferred suspension, subject to probation with 
conditions.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the 
disciplinary board, and considering the record filed herein, it is ordered that 
Claud Edward Phelps be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one 
year and one day. It is further ordered that this suspension shall be fully 
deferred and respondent shall be placed on supervised probation for a period of 
twenty-four months, subject to the conditions set forth in the petition for 
consent discipline. Any violation of the conditions of probation or any other 
misconduct during the probationary period may be grounds for making the deferred 
portion of the suspension executory, or imposing additional discipline, as 
appropriate. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against 
respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal 
interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s 
judgment until paid.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> Respondent had previously submitted 
a petition for consent discipline, but this petition was rejected by the 
disciplinary board. </p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> The conditions are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p class="footnotetext">Respondent will respond to all reasonable requests of

  <li>
  <p class="footnotetext">Respondent shall remain current in the law during the 
  period of his probation by satisfying all annual mandatory continuing legal

  Louisiana State Bar Association Fee Resolution Program regarding the fees for

</ol>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> Standard 4.42 provides that 
suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly fails to perform 
services for a client and causes injury or potential injury to the client, or 
engages in a pattern of neglect that causes injury or potential injury to a 
client. Standard 6.22 provides suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer 
knows that he or she is violating a court order or rule and caused injury or 
potential injury to a client or party, or causes interference or potential 
interference with a legal proceeding.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> We question whether this mitigating 
factor is applicable, as respondent had been admitted to the practice of law for 
approximately six years at the time of the misconduct.<br>
