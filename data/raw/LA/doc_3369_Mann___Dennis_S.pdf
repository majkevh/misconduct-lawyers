  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">LOUISIANA ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 98-DB-091</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: DENNIS S. MANN</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a petition for consent discipline by
  Dennis S. Mann prior to the filing of formal charges.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel filed a joint petition for consent discipline
  on December 14, 1998, before the filing of formal charges.  The petition was in response to two separate complaints
  filed against Respondent and the resultant Office of Disciplinary Counsel investigation.  An affidavit of consent
  executed by Respondent accompanied the petition.  On January 8, 1999, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel filed a
  concurrence.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter on January 28, 1999.  Respondent appeared
  through his attorney, Elizabeth A. Alston and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel was represented by Deputy Counsel
  James T. Daly.</p>

  <h2>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the first complaint, Respondent failed to notify and deliver funds claimed by a medical
  provider, despite executing a letter of guarantee in favor of the provider.  Apparently, Respondent gave all the
  settlement funds to the client.  Several months later, the provider was paid.  This complaint involves a violation of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct <span class="Rules">1.15</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the second complaint, Respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence in representing a
  client and failed to supervise his employees, resulting in prescription of the client's claim.  The client has since
  engaged other counsel and filed a malpractice action against Respondent.  This complaint alleges violations of Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">5.1(b)</span> and <span class="Rules">5.3(a)</span>.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX §10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a finding of
  lawyer misconduct, the court or board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(1)        whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
  system, or to the profession;</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(2)        whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(3)        the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(4)        the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The  Board finds that Respondent is guilty of the misconduct set forth in petition for consent
  discipline by clear and convincing evidence.  The Board finds that Respondent has violated duties owed to his
  clients, and has engaged in negligent misconduct. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board finds the following <i>A.B.A. Standards</i> §9.22 aggravating circumstances to be
  present:  <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>; <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the
  practice of law</span>; and a <span class="ABAstandard">prior discipline record</span>, consisting of a admonishment
  issued on May 22, 1998.  The <i>A.B.A. Standards</i> §9.32 mitigating factors are <span class="ABAstandard">a
  cooperative attitude toward these proceedings</span> and an <span class="ABAstandard">absence of dishonest and
  selfish motive</span>. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In consent disciplines, the Board may reject proposed discipline as too lenient, but when
  Respondent and disciplinary counsel have agreed that a violation has occurred, it may not reject consent discipline
  claiming that there was no violation.  <i>See</i> <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Lieberman,</i> 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96);
  <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So.2d 272</a></span>.  The Disciplinary Board therefore orders that
  Respondent, Dennis S. Mann, be issued a public reprimand and further orders that he be assessed with all costs and
  expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this
  Ruling until paid.</p>
