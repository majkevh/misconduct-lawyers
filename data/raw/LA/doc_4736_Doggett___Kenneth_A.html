    <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: KENNETH A. DOGGETT</p>

    <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

    <p class="headingstyle">JOHNSON, Justice, dissenting</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">This Court should use this opportunity to strongly disapprove conduct where an attorney,
    without first obtaining the client's informed consent, approves of a settlement and disburses funds therefrom. A
    public censure is far too lenient for these serious offenses. A more severe penalty is warranted under these
    circumstances.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">This court has determined that a public reprimand is appropriate discipline for this
    respondent, who, pursuant to an improper power of attorney clause in his contingency contract, received, endorsed,
    and negotiated his clients' settlement checks without their informed consent, and partially disbursed settlement
    funds without communicating with his clients. Paragraph seven of respondent's contingency fee contract
    provides:</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">Attorney is hereby granted special power of attorney to sign, endorse and negotiate in client's
    name any checks or drafts of any nature whatsoever issued in connection with this matter, to sign any settlement
    documents, to receive and demand payment, and Attorney is hereby authorized and directed to withhold from said
    payment(s) the appropriate attorney's fees, expenses, and/or advances associated with the handling of my claim.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">Such a power of attorney clause is expressly prohibited by the Rules of Professional Conduct.
    Rule 1.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct provides in relevant part:</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">As a general principle, all transactions between client and lawyer should be fair and
    reasonable to the client.</p>
