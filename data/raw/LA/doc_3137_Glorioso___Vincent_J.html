  <p class="headingstyle">NUMBER:  04-DB-059</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">RECOMMENDATION TO THE LOUISIANA SUPREME COURT</p>

  <h2>INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  This petition for reinstatement was filed by Vincent J. Glorioso, Jr. ("petitioner" or "Mr.
  Glorioso") on May 3, 2004.  The petitioner was suspended from the practice of law by the Louisiana Supreme Court on
  June 6, 2002 based upon his misconduct involving the conversion of third party funds, conflicts of interest, failure
  to provide full disclosure in a business transaction with a client, and the commingling of personal and client funds
  in his trust account to avoid seizure of his personal funds by the IRS.  <i>See</i> <span class="cite"><i>In re
  Glorioso</i>, 2002-1074 (La. 6/6/02); <a href="../SC/2002-06-06_2002-1074.htm">818 So.2d 320</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  The petition for reinstatement was forwarded to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") by
  the Board Administrator's Office on May 3, 2004.  ODC filed an answer to the petition for reinstatement on July 14,
  2004 in which it took no position with respect to the petition and requested that the matter be fixed for hearing. 
  The hearing in this matter was held on August 17, 2004.  The hearing committee issued its report on September 8,
  2004, recommending that the petition for reinstatement be granted. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  Neither party filed a response to the hearing committee's report. Oral argument before Panel
  "C" of the Disciplinary Board was held on October 28, 2004.  Deputy Disciplinary Counsel Robert S. Kennedy, Jr.
  appeared on behalf of ODC.  The petitioner and his counsel, John R. Martzell, also appeared.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <h3>I.  The Reinstatement Hearing</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Stipulations entered into by the parties at the hearing establish that the petitioner has
  satisfied all the criteria of Rule XIX, Section 24(E).  These criteria are as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1)  The petitioner has fully complied with the terms and conditions of all prior disciplinary

    <p class="inverted">(2)  The petitioner has not engaged or attempted to engage in the unauthorized practice of law

    was suspended;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(5)  The petitioner has not engaged in any other professional misconduct since his
    suspension;</p>

    dues;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(10)  The petitioner has paid to the Disciplinary Board currently owed disciplinary

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC's proposed stipulations contained in its pre-hearing memorandum filed on August 2,
  2004<a name="_ftnref1" class="fn" href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>; and petitioner's proposed stipulations
  (numbers 4-7) contained in his pre-hearing memorandum filed on August 6, 2004<a name="_ftnref2" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In further support of his petition, Mr. Glorioso offered testimony at the hearing from:  Russ M.
  Herman, a New Orleans attorney and professional and social acquaintance of the petitioner; Maria Glorioso,
  petitioner's daughter, a New Orleans attorney, and his employer; and Neal K. Adler, petitioner's CPA.  Petitioner
  also testified in support of his petition.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Herman testified as to the petitioner's good character and reputation and petitioner's
  willingness to accept responsibility for his misconduct.  Tr. pp. 8-10. Ms. Glorioso testified that petitioner
  currently works as a paralegal in her office.  Tr. p. 20.  She further testified that, assuming petitioner was
  reinstated to the practice of law, he would not have access to clients' funds. Tr. pp. 20-23.  Petitioner would be an
  employee of the firm, and all cases would belong to the firm.  Tr. pp. 23, 25. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Adler testified that if the clients' funds were placed in the Glorioso Law Firm trust
  account, the funds would not be subject to a lien for any of the petitioner's tax liability.  Tr. pp. 29, 31.  He
  further testified that the petitioner was current with all his federal income tax filings and that he had received a
  valid extension to file his 2003 return until October 15, 2004.<a name="_ftnref3" class="fn" href="#_ftn3"
  id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> While petitioner has not paid all taxes due under these filings, the IRS has not issued any
  notices of deficiency or lien of enforcement against the petitioner.  Tr. pp. 29-30.  Only his personal earnings
  found in his personal bank accounts would be subject to seizure by the IRS.  Tr. pp. 31-32.  </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The petitioner testified that he has made restitution in all of the underlying disciplinary
  matters, that he only has a personal checking account, and that, if reinstated, he will not have any professional
  accounts.  All clients' funds will go into the Glorioso Law Firm trust account. Tr. p. 38-39.  He also testified that
  he anticipates his tax problems with the IRS to be over within a year.  Tr. p. 49.<a name="_ftnref4" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a>  He stated that he will remain an employee of the Glorioso Law Firm and that any
  cases he works on will be property of the firm.  Tr. p. 44.  Petitioner also stated that he will never get into a
  "business arrangement" with a client again.  Tr. p. 46-47.  Moreover, the petitioner submitted an affidavit and
  numerous letters from lawyers who wrote to ODC attesting to his good character and reputation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  Based on the above, the Board finds that the hearing committee correctly concluded that the
  petitioner met the criteria of Section 24(E).  Petitioner also established that his current tax liability is not a
  threat to any funds belonging to the clients or prospective clients of the Glorioso Law Firm and that he will not
  engage in improper "business arrangements" with clients in the future.  The Board therefore recommends that his
  petition for reinstatement be granted.</p>

  <h2>RECOMMENDATION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  The Disciplinary Board adopts the hearing committee's recommendation and recommends that Mr.
  Glorioso's petition for reinstatement be granted.  The petitioner has met the criteria under Rule XIX, Section 24(E)
  for reinstatement.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn1" class="fn" href="#_ftnref1" id="_ftn1">[1]</a> These proposed stipulations
  are as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnoteinverted">1.  Petitioner has made acceptable and appropriate restitution on all matters that were
    the subject of the Court's original discipline order.</p>

    <p class="footnoteinverted">2.  Petitioner has been entirely cooperative and forthcoming in Disciplinary Counsel's
    investigation of petitioner's application for readmission and reinstatement.</p>

    <p class="footnoteinverted">3.  Disciplinary Counsel has received no information from any source suggesting or
    indicating that the petitioner has engaged in the unauthorized practice of law or other misconduct during the term
    of his suspension.</p>

    <p class="footnoteinverted">4.  As far as Disciplinary Counsel is aware, the petitioner has fully complied with all
    requirements of Rule XIX, Section 24(E) setting forth the criteria for reinstatement.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn2" class="fn" href="#_ftnref2" id="_ftn2">[2]</a> These proposed stipulations
  are as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnoteinverted">4. All matters which were the subject of the consent discipline have been completely

    21, 2004, with attachments.</p>

    <p class="footnoteinverted">6.  The parties stipulate to the matters set forth in petitioner's letter of April 20,
    2004 to Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, Robert S. Kennedy, with attachments.</p>

    <p class="footnoteinverted">7.  The parties stipulate to the representations made by petitioner in his Verified
    Petition for Reinstatement. </p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn3" class="fn" href="#_ftnref3" id="_ftn3">[3]</a> At the oral argument held
  before the Board, counsel for petitioner indicated that the petitioner had in fact filed his 2003 return prior to his
  extension deadline.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn4" class="fn" href="#_ftnref4" id="_ftn4">[4]</a> Petitioner's testimony
  indicates that he initially owed over $120,000 in income tax to the IRS plus penalties and interest.  He stated in
  his testimony that the bulk of his IRS problems have been discharged in bankruptcy, although no one could give him an
  "absolute fair answer."  He anticipates making an offer in compromise to the IRS around the time his 2004 return is
  filed and paying what amount is due over a period of time.  He explained that "the IRS will not be hounding me to any
  extent that will impair my ability to give my full attention and my emotional, physical, whatever little gift I have
  to [give] to [my clients'] cases."  Tr. pp. 47-49.</p>

    <p class="headingstyle">Docket No: 04-DB-059</p>

    <p class="headingstyle">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">  I reluctantly concur with the panel's recommendation in this matter.  I have serious concerns
    regarding whether the petitioner should be readmitted to practice while he has an obligation to the IRS for
    $120,000.00 in income taxes, plus penalties and interest.  Not having the benefit of the transcript of his
    testimony, I understand from footnote 1 of the panel's recommendation that the petitioner thinks that the bulk of
    his IRS problems have been discharged in bankruptcy, although no one can give him an "absolute fair answer."  It is
    difficult to have an IRS income tax lien discharged in bankruptcy, although it can be done.  I would feel much more
    comfortable if the panel recommended that the Supreme Court defer acting on Mr. Glorioso's Petition for
    Reinstatement until satisfactory evidence is furnished that he has, indeed fully resolved his problems with the
    IRS.  I am not, however, prepared to dissent if the majority of the board feels otherwise.</p>
