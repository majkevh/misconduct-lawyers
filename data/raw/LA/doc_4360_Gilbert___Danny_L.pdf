<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hearing committee reiterated the factual information set forth in the<b> </b>formal charges and concluded that respondent violated the professional rules as charged.&nbsp; With respect to the imposition of discipline for respondent's misconduct, the committee found the baseline sanction is a one vear and one dav suspension.&nbsp; The committee did not find any mitigating factors, but noted the presence<b> </b>of numerous aggravating, ating factors: prior di<b> </b>tary action, <span class="CITE"><font size="1">(FN3)</font></span> dishonest or selfish motive, a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary process, submission of false evidence and statements during the disciplinary process, refusal to acknowledge the Aongful nature of the conduct, vulnerability of the victims, substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted 1986). and indifference to making restitution.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, the hearing committee recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year and one day.&nbsp; The committee also recommended that respondent be ordered to make full restitution, with legal interest, to his clients.&nbsp; Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the hearing committee's report.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hearing committee reiterated the factual information set forth in the formal charges and concluded that respondent violated the professional rules as charged.&nbsp; The committee concluded respondent violated duties owed to his clients, the profession, and the legal system, and that respondent's misconduct was at least knowing, if not intentional. The committee also found that the potential injury to respondent's clients from his misconduct was significant, and that respondent's failure to cooperate with the disciplinary process resulted in delay, diverted the limited resources of the system, and impaired its orderly functioning.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Referring to the ABA's <i>Slundards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, </i>the committee found Standard 4.12 suggests that suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knows or should know that he is dealing improperly with client propertv and causes injury or potential injury to a client.&nbsp; Further, Standard 7.1 suggests that suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional, and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, or the legal system.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As aggravating factors, the committee found prior disciplinary action, dishonest motive<b>, </b>a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, obstruction of the disciplinary process, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct. vulnerability of the victims, substantial experience in the practice of law, and indifference to making restitution.&nbsp; The committee found no mitigating circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accordingly, the committee recommended respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one vear and one day.&nbsp; The committee also recommended that respondent be ordered to make full restitution to his clients and to pay all costs of these proceedings.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The board concurred in the findings of the hearing committees that respondent is guiltn, of the misconduct set forth in both sets of formal charges and that the charges, in their entirety, were proven by clear and convincing evidence.&nbsp; The board found that respondent has violated duties owed to the legal svstem, the profession, and the public, and has engaged in knowing and intentional misconduct.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The board found the following aggravating factors: prior discipline, dishonest motive, a pattern of misconduct. multiple offenses, obstruction of the disciplinary process, refusal to acknowledge ,wrongdoing, vulnerability of the victims, substantial legal experience in the practice of law, and indifference to making restitution.&nbsp; The board found no mitigating factors.<span class="CITE"><font size="1">(FN5)</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With respect to the sanction to be imposed for respondent's misconduct, the board agreed that the hearing committee's recommendations of a suspension of one year and one day are appropriate.&nbsp; However, because the matter involves two consolidated cases, the board found that a single suspension of one year and one day would be inappropriate.&nbsp; Accordingly, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of two years.&nbsp; The board further recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings. with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of the court's judgment until paid.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The board found the following aggravating factors to be present: prior discipline, dishonest motive, a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, obstruction of the disciplinary process, refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing, vulnerability of the victims, substantial legal experience in the practice of law, and indifference to making restitution.&nbsp; The board also noted that respondent is ineligible to practice law for his failure to fulfill his continuing legal education requirements and his failure to pay bar dues and the disciplinary assessment.&nbsp; The board found no mitigating factors.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The board then turned to a discussion of an appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct.&nbsp; The board noted that three sets of formal charges have been instituted against respondent, alleging a total of eleven counts of misconduct, all of which have been deemed admitted.&nbsp; Considering the significant aggravating factors and the absence of mitigating factors, the board concluded there is no reason to deviate from the baseline sanction of disbarment.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accordincly, the board recommended that respondent be disbar-red from the practice of law.&nbsp; The board further recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of the court's judgement until paid.</p>

<br>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="2"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The record supports the hearing committees' findings that the ODC proved respondent's misconduct by clear and convincing evidence.&nbsp; His actions demonstrate a pattern of neglect of client matters, failing to account for client funds, and lying to clients regarding the status of their legal matters.&nbsp; Moreover, respondent has made no genuine attempt at restitution, and his conduct has caused actual hariti to his clients.&nbsp; Under the guidelines set forth in <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n</i><b><i> </i></b><i>Hinrichs, 486 So. 2d 116 (La. 1986)</i></span>, disbarment is an appropriate sanction for such misconduct.</p>

After the board considered the consolidated matters and filed its recommendation with this court, the ODC informed the court that another set of formal charges was pending against respondent. On February 3, 1999, this court ordered that the two consolidated cases be remanded to the board for consolidation with the third set of formal charges, in order that a single recommendation of discipline could be made by the board for all three matters. <i>In re: Gilbert, 98-3221, 98-3222 (La. 2/3/99), 731 So. 2d 188.<br>
