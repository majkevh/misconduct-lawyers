<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

<p>

<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter stems from eleven counts of formal
charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
(&ldquo;ODC&rdquo;) against respondent, Jay J. Szuba, an attorney
licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>



<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

<h3>Patt Matter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p class="Bodycopy">In March 1997, Robert Patt retained respondent to pursue a
pending civil suit against Mr. Patt&rsquo;s former employer for
unpaid sales commission funds.&nbsp; Respondent agreed to undertake
the representation, because&nbsp; the original attorney handling
the case for Mr. Patt was moving out of town.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,
respondent did not enter into a written contract with the client,
nor did he file a motion to substitute himself as counsel of record
in the case.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">

<p class="Bodycopy">Thereafter, respondent neglected the legal matter in general, as
well as failed to communicate with Mr. Patt regarding the status of
the case, despite Mr. Patt&rsquo;s numerous efforts to obtain
information.&nbsp; In April 1998, after several months of
attempting to contact respondent, Mr. Patt requested respondent
return his file.&nbsp; Respondent did not return the file until
February 1999, over ten months after it was requested.&nbsp; At
that time, Mr. Patt learned respondent had failed to take any
action in the matter.</p>

<p>

<h3>Baton Rouge Rifle and Pistol Club Matter</h3>

<p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an appeal on behalf of&nbsp; the Baton Rouge
Rifle and Pistol Club (&ldquo;Club&rdquo;).&nbsp; Respondent failed
to file a brief timely, and the court of appeal dismissed the
appeal on February 18, 2000.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon discovering that the
appeal was dismissed,&nbsp; respondent allegedly told the Club that
the appeal remained viable.&nbsp; However, the Club discharged
respondent and requested that he return its files.&nbsp; Respondent
did not return the files until after the Club filed a disciplinary
complaint with the ODC, and even at that time, some of the files
were missing.</p>

<p>

<h3>Feinswog Matter</h3>

<p>

<p class="Bodycopy">In March 1996, Harold Feinswog retained respondent to handle a
pending divorce proceeding and community property
disposition.&nbsp; At the time, Mr. Feinswog gave respondent two
checks totaling $2,000 as a retainer.&nbsp; After being
retained,&nbsp; respondent had several meetings with both his
client and opposing counsel and&nbsp; appeared in court on behalf
of his client.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was ultimately successful in obtaining a judgement of
divorce for Mr. Feinswog, but did not complete the community
property settlement as directed.&nbsp; Thereafter, respondent
failed to communicate with Mr. Feinswog.&nbsp; After several
unsuccessful attempts to reach respondent, Mr. Feinswog sent
respondent a certified letter,&nbsp; asking that respondent contact
him immediately regarding the status of his case.&nbsp; Respondent
refused delivery of the letter. When Mr. Feinswog later appeared at
respondent&rsquo;s office, respondent advised him that he was
moving his law office and provided a false forwarding address.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">

<p class="Bodycopy">In October 1998, Mr. Feinswog retained new counsel, Steve
Benton, to take over the representation.&nbsp; Mr. Benton took
numerous efforts to recover Mr. Feinswog&rsquo;s file from
respondent.&nbsp; Respondent ultimately produced some of the file
pursuant to court order, but did not produce the entire file.
Additionally, respondent only accounted for $840 of the $2,000 fee
he received from Mr. Feinswog.</p>

<p>

<h3>Thomas Matter </h3>

<p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Damon Thomas retained respondent in 1988 to pursue a personal
injury claim against Mr. Thomas&rsquo; former employer.&nbsp;
Respondent filed suit on Mr. Thomas&rsquo; behalf in federal
court.&nbsp; The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, on
the ground that Mr. Thomas was its statutory employee.&nbsp;
Respondent did not oppose the motion for summary judgment,
contending he feared sanctions of under Rule 11 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure.&nbsp; As a result, Mr. Thomas&rsquo;
action was dismissed.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">

<p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, Mr. Thomas filed a legal malpractice action
against respondent.&nbsp; The trial judge in the malpractice action
rendered summary judgment in favor of respondent.&nbsp; However,
respondent ultimately settled with Mr. Thomas for $175,000.</p>

<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

<h3>Formal Charges</h3>

<p>

<p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed eleven counts of formal
charges against respondent based on his conduct in the Patt, Club,
Feinswog and Thomas matters.&nbsp; The charges asserted violations
of the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct:
Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.3'>1.3</a>
(lack of diligence), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.4'>1.4</a>
(failure to communicate) and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.16'>1.16</a>(d)
(failure to return client property at termination of
representation).</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an answer, denying any misconduct.&nbsp;
Additionally, respondent raised mitigating factors, including
personal problems.</p>

<p>

<h3>Formal Hearing</h3>

<p>

<p class="Bodycopy">A formal hearing was conducted, at which time respondent
represented himself in proper person.&nbsp; The ODC presented the
testimony of each of respondent&rsquo;s former clients, as well as
their respective attorneys.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent testified on his own behalf.&nbsp; Respondent did not
dispute the allegations of misconduct.&nbsp; He acknowledged he
could have handled his clients&rsquo; matters more professionally
and kept them informed.&nbsp; However, he attributed his neglect
and failure to communicate to his personal problems stemming from
the illnesses and deaths of three family members.&nbsp;
Specifically, respondent maintained his mother was diagnosed with
Lou Gehrig&rsquo;s disease in 1996, which left her bedridden.&nbsp;
Respondent asserted he essentially closed his law practice so he
could provide full-time care to her, until her death in 1998. In
addition, he alleged he cared for his cousin, who resided in New
York, who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 1997 and died in
1999.&nbsp; Last, respondent claimed his uncle in Arizona died in
early 1999 from a brain injury stemming from a medical malpractice
incident.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent testified that he has essentially quit practicing
law, although he occasionally provides research and writing
services to other attorneys.&nbsp;&nbsp; He maintained that he has
taken responsibility for his actions. While he recognized he may
never practice law again, he stated that he nevertheless did not
want to lose his license.</p>

Recommendation of the Hearing Committee</a></h3>

<p>

<p class="Bodycopy">The committee determined there was clear and convincing evidence
in&nbsp; the Patt, Club and the Feinswog matters that&nbsp;
respondent neglected his clients&rsquo; cases, failed to
communicate with his clients and failed to return his
clients&rsquo; property.&nbsp; With regard to the Club matter, the
court found there was insufficient evidence that respondent
intentionally misrepresented facts to the Club regarding the filing
of their appeal, noting that at the time respondent made the
statement that the appeal was viable, he did not know the appeal
had been dismissed based on his failure to file the appellate
brief.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">

<p class="Bodycopy">As to the Feinswog matter, the committee agreed that respondent
failed to account, but found that he did not fail to refund the
unearned attorney&rsquo;s fee because he earned the entire $2,000
retained.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the committee found insufficient
evidence to support all of the charges subject of the Thomas
matter.&nbsp; Specifically, the committee recognized that there was
no indication respondent neglected his client&rsquo;s case based on
the failure to file an opposition to the defendant&rsquo;s motion
for summary judgment.&nbsp; It relied on the fact that the trial
judge granted summary judgment in favor of respondent in the legal
malpractice action, which the committee concluded basically
vindicated respondent&rsquo;s failure to oppose the motion for
summary judgment.&nbsp; It further concluded there was no evidence
of respondent&rsquo;s failure to communicate with his client.&nbsp;
The committee noted that respondent testified he communicated with
Mt. Thomas verbally and by correspondence.&nbsp; The committee
found no merit in Mr. Thomas&rsquo; allegation that respondent
failed to disclose settlement offers made to him in the federal
proceeding.&nbsp; In support, it relied on Mr. Thomas&rsquo;
testimony that he knew the defendant made an offer in 1989 and
respondent told him that he was trying to settle the case.&nbsp;
Further, the committee found credible respondent&rsquo;s testimony
that, when the motion for summary judgment was filed in the civil
matter, he advised his client that they had a problem based on his
appreciation of the facts and the law.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">

<p class="Bodycopy">Thus, the committee concluded respondent violated Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.3'>1.3</a>
(lack of diligence), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.4'>1.4</a>
(failure to communicate) and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.16'>1.16</a>(d)
(failure to return client property at termination of
representation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.&nbsp; Citing
Standards 4.42 and 7.2 of ABA&rsquo;s <i>Standards for Imposing
Lawyer Sanctions,<a id="_ednref2" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">1</a></i> the committee determined the baseline sanction
for this misconduct is suspension.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">

<p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the committee recognized
respondent&rsquo;s prior disciplinary infractions,<a id="_ednref3" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">2</a> pattern of misconduct,
multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary
proceedings by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders
of the disciplinary agency, vulnerability of victim and substantial
experience in the practice of law (admitted in 1983).&nbsp; In
mitigation, it recognized respondent&rsquo;s personal or emotional
problems stemming from the illnesses and deaths of
respondent&rsquo;s mother, cousin and uncle, as well as his
unsuccessful business ventures in 1996 and 1997.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">

<p class="Bodycopy">Based on these factors, the committee recommended that
respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of
two years followed by a one-year period of supervised
probation.</p>

<p>

Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></h3>

<p>

<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board found no manifest error in the
committee&rsquo;s findings of fact, including its finding that
there was insufficient evidence to support the charges in the
Thomas matter.<a id="_ednref4" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Relying on the ABA Standards and
aggravating and mitigating factors cited by the committee, as well
as jurisprudence from this court, the board recommended that
respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period two
years, subject to a one year period of supervised probation to
monitor respondent&rsquo;s law office management and practice
procedures.&nbsp; One board member filed a concurrence maintaining
that, but for respondent&rsquo;s failure to participate in the
disciplinary process, a one-year suspension might be a more
appropriate sanction.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">

<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court
to the hearing committee&rsquo;s recommendation.</p>

<p>

<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

<p>

<p class="Bodycopy">The record supports the finding that respondent knowingly and
negligently neglected three clients&rsquo; legal matters, failed to
communicate with those clients, failed to return their property and
failed to provide an accounting to one client.&nbsp; Therefore, the
sole issue presented for our consideration is the appropriate
sanction for respondent&rsquo;s misconduct.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">

<p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that
disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of
conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the
profession, and deter future misconduct.&nbsp; <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State
Bar Ass&rsquo;n v. Reis</i>, <a href="#!-- ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.&nbsp; The
discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and
the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of
any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.&nbsp; <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana
State Bar Ass&rsquo;n v. Whittington</i>, <a href="#!-- ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La.
1984)</span>.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent&rsquo;s negligent actions potentially jeopardized his
clients&rsquo; legal matters and delayed resolution of their
cases.&nbsp; This court has generally imposed substantial
suspensions for similar misconduct involving multiple
clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>See <span class="CITE">In re: Boudreau,</span></i><span class="CITE"> 00-3158 (La.
1/5/01), <a href="#!-- ID:776%20So.2d%20428 --">776 So. 2d 428</a></span> (three year suspension imposed on an
attorney who neglected three clients&rsquo; matters, failed to
communicate with the clients, failed to account for and return
unearned fees, failed to repay a student loan, withheld client
property and failed to cooperate with ODC<i>)</i> and <span class="CITE"> <i>In re:
Powers,</i> 99-2069 (La. 9/24/99), <a href="#!-- ID:744%20So.2d%201275 --">744 So. 2d 1275</a></span> (three year
suspension imposed on attorney with a prior disciplinary record for
similar misconduct who neglected three clients&rsquo; legal
matters, failed to communicate with the clients, failed to account
for and return unearned fees and failed to cooperate with the ODC).&nbsp; However, we recognize the presence of several
mitigating factors in this case, including respondent&rsquo;s
significant personal problems during the time period in
question.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">

<p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board&rsquo;s
recommendation and suspend respondent from the practice of law for
a period of two years, followed by a one year period of supervised
probation.</p>

<p>

<h2>DECREE</h2>

<p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing
committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is
ordered that Jay J. Szuba be suspended from the practice of law for
a period of two years, followed by a one year period of supervised
probation.&nbsp; All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed
against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX,
&sect; <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s10.1'>10.1</a>,
with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
finality of this court&rsquo;s judgment until paid.</p>

the circumstances surrounding respondent&rsquo;s handling of Mr.

that respondent did not oppose the defendant&rsquo;s motion for
summary judgment in the underlying suit, and did not communicate
settlement offers in that suit to Mr. Thomas.&nbsp; However, the
board deferred to the committee&rsquo;s ultimate finding that there
was insufficient evidence that respondent neglected the Thomas
matter.&nbsp; In doing so, it relied on Mr. Thomas&rsquo; testimony
that respondent did communicate verbally with respondent regarding
the lawsuit, the law dealing with statutory employment was in flux
at the time Mr. Thomas&rsquo; suit was pending against his employer
and respondent testified that he feared Rule 11 sanctions from the
presiding federal judge in the civil suit, had he opposed the
motion.</p>
