<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 02-B-1670</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: FRANCIS C. BROUSSARD</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This matter arises from a petition for consent discipline 
submitted by respondent, Francis C. Broussard, following the filing of formal 
charges by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”). </p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS </h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">This proceeding involves two separate counts of misconduct. 
The facts, as stipulated to by the parties, are as follows:</p>
<h3>Balsamo Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent represented Steve Balsamo in a workers’ 
compensation matter. During the representation, Mr. Balsamo was hired by a 
construction company which was partially owned by respondent. Mr. Balsamo was 
injured again while working for respondent’s company. Respondent represented him 
for a period of time in connection with this claim until he was terminated by 
Mr. Balsamo. At no time did respondent obtain a waiver of the conflict of 
interest from his client.</p>
<h3>Edwards Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Sandra D. Edwards retained respondent to represent her in a 
personal injury claim and a workers’ compensation matter. At some point, the 
personal injury claim was settled; however, respondent failed to disburse the 
settlement proceeds to Ms. Edwards for over a year. During the time respondent 
was holding these funds, the balance in his trust account fell below the amount 
of the client’s share due to negligent bookkeeping. Respondent ultimately paid 
Ms. Edwards all funds due her from the settlement. </p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed two counts of formal 
charges against respondent. The first count, relating to the Balsamo matter, 
alleged respondent violated Rule <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.7 --#">1.7</a>(b)</span> of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct by representing a client where the representation conflicted with the 
lawyer’s own interest without obtaining the consent of the client after 
consultation. The second count, relating to the Edwards matter, alleged that 
respondent violated Rule <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.15 --#">1.15</a>(a) 
and (b)</span> by commingling and converting his client’s funds.<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a>
</p>
<h3>Petition for Consent Discipline</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Prior to a hearing on the formal charges, respondent filed a 
petition for consent discipline, in which he stipulated to the facts and 
admitted his conduct violated Rules 1.7(b) and 1.15 (a) and (b). As a sanction, 
respondent proposed that he receive a six-month suspension from the practice of 
law, fully deferred. Respondent further proposed that he be placed on supervised 
probation for a period of one year, subject to the conditions that he submit to 
a quarterly audit of his trust account by a CPA, attend six additional hours of 
continuing legal education in the area of law office practice and trust accounts 
and that he attend and complete the Louisiana State Bar Association’s Ethics 
School.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC concurred with the petition for consent discipline. 
In its concurrence, the ODC observed that respondent’s rule violations resulted 
from negligence and were corrected by him once they were discovered.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-065.BD --#">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on respondent’s admission of misconduct, the board 
accepted that he violated the rules as charged and found the sole issue before 
it was whether the proposed sanction was appropriate. Citing this court’s 
opinions in <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Reed</i>, 99-3435 (La. 1/14/00),
<a href="#!-- #ID:753%20So.2d%20175 --#">753 So. 2d 175</a></span>, and
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Sarama</i>, 97-0452 (La. 6/13/97),
<a href="#!-- #ID:695%20So.2d%20517 --#">695 So. 2d 517</a></span>, the board 
found that this court imposed fully deferred suspensions followed by probation 
for similar misconduct. As aggravating factors, it identified respondent’s prior 
discipline<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> and multiple offenses. In mitigation, the board 
found respondent paid restitution and demonstrated a cooperative attitude toward 
the disciplinary proceedings.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on this analysis, the board found the proposed 
sanction was in line with existing case law and was appropriate to address 
respondent’s misconduct. Accordingly, the board recommended the petition for 
consent discipline be accepted.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary 
board’s recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Although this matter arises from a petition for consent 
discipline, Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 20(B) provides that the extent of 
discipline to be imposed is subject to review. In determining an appropriate 
sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain 
high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the 
profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State 
Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> 
(La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each 
case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any 
aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State 
Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 
520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent’s misconduct, especially his failure to disburse 
client funds for over a year, is serious in nature. However, it appears his 
actions resulted from negligence rather than any dishonest or selfish motive. 
There is no indication that the client in the Balsamo matter suffered any 
significant harm from respondent’s actions. Likewise, the client in the Edwards 
matter was not significantly harmed, and ultimately received all of the funds 
due to her. We consider respondent’s payment of restitution, combined with his 
cooperative attitude toward these proceedings, to be important mitigating 
factors.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Under similar facts, we have imposed fully deferred 
suspensions, combined with probation. See, e.g., <span class="CITE"><i>In re: 
Reed</i>, 99-3435 (La. 1/14/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:753%20So.2d%20175 --#">753 So. 
2d 175</a></span> (six month suspension, fully deferred, followed by one year 
period of supervised probation imposed upon an attorney who commingled and 
converted client funds but who repaid those funds and displayed a cooperative 
attitude). Such an approach gives the lawyer an opportunity to correct the 
problems which caused the misconduct, while at the same time protecting the 
public from future misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the petition for consent 
discipline, and impose a fully deferred suspension, subject to probation with 
conditions.<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a></p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the 
disciplinary board, and considering the record filed herein, it is ordered that 
Francis C. Broussard be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six 
months. It is further ordered that this suspension shall be fully deferred and 
respondent shall be placed on supervised probation for a period of one year, 
subject to the conditions set forth in the petition for consent discipline. Any 
violation of the conditions of probation or any other misconduct during the 
probationary period may be grounds for making the deferred portion of the 
suspension executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate. All 
costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance 
with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days 
from the date of finality of this court’s judgment until paid.<br>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> The ODC also charged respondent 
violated Rule 1.4 by failing to communicate with Ms. Edwards. However, the ODC 
later dismissed this portion of the charges.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> Respondent received an admonition in 
1998, but the record does not contain any information regarding the underlying 
facts of this admonition.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> Because the sanction in consent 
discipline proceedings is arrived at by mutual agreement between respondent and 
the ODC, and is not necessarily the sanction this court would approve after a 
hearing before a hearing committee and a recommendation by the disciplinary 
board, it has limited precedential value in future cases. See, e.g.,
