<p><font face='Times New Roman'><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In June 1 998, respondent represented a client in a family court matter while she was ineligible to practice law.&nbsp; Respondent's ineligibility arose from her failure to complete the required number of mandatory continuing legal education hours.&nbsp; Respondent admits her actions violated </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE5.5'></a>(a)<font face='Times New Roman'> (unauthorized practice of law) of the Rules of Professional Conduct</font><p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In September 1998, while representing a client in a criminal matter, respondent became involved in a &quot;highly improper relationship&quot; with her client,<span class="CITE"><font size="1">(FN1)</font></span> thereby creating a conflict of interest, that prevented respondent from exercising her independent professional judgment.&nbsp; Respondent admits her actions violated <span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.7'></a> (conflict of interest) and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE2.1'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a> (failure to exercise independent professional judgment in representing a client) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the course of its investigation of these matters, the ODC requested that respondent make herself available for a swom statement.&nbsp; On three occasions, dates were set for respondent to appear.&nbsp; On the first occasion, respondent appeared forty-five minutes late, then refused to answer sonic of the ODC's questions.&nbsp; On the second occasion, respondent again appeared forty-five minutes late.&nbsp; On the third occasion, respondent refused to appear.&nbsp; Respondent admits her actions violated </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.1'></a>(c)<font face='Times New Roman'> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation), </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a>(d)<font face='Times New Roman'> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), and </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a>(g)<font face='Times New Roman'> (failure to cooperate with </font><font face='Times New Roman'>the ODC in its investigation)</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> </font><font face='Times New Roman'>of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</font><p>
<br>
<p><font face='Times New Roman'><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prior to the filing of formal charges, respondent and the ODC jointly agreed that respondent would submit to consent discipline.&nbsp; The parties proposed:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A suspension from the practice of law for a period of six months;<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The period of suspension to be followed by 18 months supervised</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;probation with a practice monitor;<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Following the period of six months of suspension, any request for reinstatement &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;must be accompanied by a report of a psychological evaluation, demonstrating that the Respondent is then fit toresume the practice of law<font size="1">;<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font><font size="3">D. </font> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prior to any request for reinstatement, Respondent must <font size="3">be in </font>compliance with all &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;rules concerning bar association dues, discipliner, fees, and Mandatory&nbsp; Continuing Legal Education requirements and,<br>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The disciplinary board found respondent has admitted that she engaged in the misconduct set forth in the petition for consent discipline.&nbsp; Relying on the <i>ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> <span class="CITE"><font size="1">(FN2)</font></span> and on jurisprudence from this court,<span class="CITE"><font size="1">(FN3) </font></span>the board concluded the proposed consent discipline&quot;appears to be appropriate and in line with other similar instances of misconduct.&quot; The board suggested that respondent's misconduct is mitigated by the absence of a prior disciplinary <font size="3">record,. </font>however, it also recognized multiple offenses and substantial experience in the practice of law as aggravating factors.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accordingly, the board recommended respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six months, followed by an eighteen-month period of supervised probation subject to the special conditions proposed in the petition for consent discipline.&nbsp; The board further recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence thirty days from The date of finality of this court's judgement until paid.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the recommendation of the disciplinary board.</p>
<br>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>

Accordinyly, we will accept the petition for consent discipline.</p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b>DECREE</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the record filed herein, it is ordered that Leila Selden Withers be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months, followed by an eighteen-month period of supervised probation subject to the specific ten-ns and conditions set for-th in the joint petition for consent discipline.&nbsp; All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with , with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
