<p class="signature"><span class="Author">TRAYLOR, J.</span></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office
of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) against respondent, Roger W. Jordan, Jr., a former
Orleans Parish prosecutor.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></p><h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2><p class="Bodycopy">On April 22, 2003, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against
respondent, alleging that he violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">3.8(d)</span><a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span><a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> of the Rules of
Professional Conduct by failing to timely disclose to the defense evidence tending to
negate the guilt of the accused or mitigate the offense. The formal charges against
respondent arise from the capital prosecution of Shareef Cousin and respondent's
undisputed failure to turn over an eyewitness's statement to the defense.</p><h2>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY OF STATE V. COUSIN:</h2><p class="Bodycopy">Before addressing the merits of the case, it is necessary to discuss, in some
detail, the underlying facts and procedural history of Shareef Cousin's criminal case.</p><p class="Bodycopy">On March 2, 1995, Michael Gerardi was shot at point-blank range during an
armed robbery attempt outside the Port of Call restaurant in New Orleans. Connie
Ann Babin, Mr. Gerardi's date that evening and the only eyewitness to the murder,
gave three separate statements to the New Orleans Police Department during the
homicide investigation. When questioned on the night of the murder, a &quot;visibly
shaken&quot; Ms. Babin told the police that she &quot;did not get a good look at the perpetrators
and probably could not identify them.&quot; (Statement 1).<a name="fnref4" class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> In the second statement,
which was tape recorded by police at Ms. Babin's home on March 5, 1995, three days
after the murder, Ms. Babin was asked by a New Orleans Police Department detective
whether she could &quot;describe the person who did the shooting, his clothing?&quot; In
response, Ms. Babin said that she remembered the shooter was wearing an oversized
denim jacket (Statement 2). She continued:</p><blockquote>
  <p>I don't know, it was dark and I did not have my contacts
nor my glasses so I'm coming at this at a disadvantage . .
I . . you know you could see outlines and shapes and things
that stick out, but er . . the socks, I remember the colorful
socks, because he kept drawing my attention to it when he
kept fidgeting at his ankle area, . . .</p></blockquote>

<p class="Bodycopy">Ms. Babin went on to describe the shooter's hair and to say that the shooter was in his
late teens and five feet seven or eight inches tall. After providing this description,
Ms. Babin stated:</p><blockquote>
  <p>As he looked to me . . I keep getting this vision of a young
man with, with an older man's face . . er I don't know that
if this is coming . . er somewhere, or if I really did see this
person . . . if this is just coming from my imagination or
what, but I . . every time I go over it and close my eyes er
. . I remember thinking that he had an older man's face or
a young body, on a young person . . how I visualize that, I
don't know. . .</p></blockquote>

<p class="Bodycopy">On March 25, 1995, three weeks after the murder, Ms. Babin viewed a
photographic lineup presented by the police and positively identified sixteen-year old
Shareef Cousin as the shooter (Statement 3).<a name="fnref5" class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> Mr. Cousin was arrested a short time
later and indicted for the first degree murder of Mr. Gerardi.</p><p class="Bodycopy">In the summer of 1995, the criminal case was assigned to respondent, then an
assistant district attorney in Orleans Parish. When respondent was first assigned the
case, he recalls that there were three identification witnesses.<a name="fnref6" class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a> However, Ms. Babin
was the only witness to positively identify Mr. Cousin.<a name="fnref7" class="fn" href="#fn7">7</a></p><p class="Bodycopy">In preparing for trial, respondent interviewed Ms. Babin. She informed him
that she is nearsighted and only needs her contacts or glasses for nighttime driving,
but not to see at close distances. Considering this information, respondent
unilaterally determined that the absence of contacts or glasses on the night of the
murder did not affect Ms. Babin's identification of Mr. Cousin as the shooter.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Respondent testified at his disciplinary hearing that he believed Ms. Babin's
second statement provided significant additional details that tended to corroborate her
identification of Mr. Cousin, especially the observation of the killer as having &quot;an old
man's face&quot; on &quot;a young person's body.&quot;<a name="fnref8" class="fn" href="#fn8">8</a> Respondent therefore concluded that, in
his judgment, Ms. Babin's second statement was not material exculpatory evidence
to which the defense would be entitled under <span class="cite">Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83
S.Ct. 1194, 1196-1197, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963)</span>.<a name="fnref9" class="fn" href="#fn9">9</a> Accordingly, he did not produce that
statement to Mr. Cousin's attorneys in response to their motion for the production of
exculpatory evidence.<a name="fnref10" class="fn" href="#fn10">10</a> Respondent has never maintained that he was unaware of his
obligation as a prosecutor to disclose exculpatory evidence pursuant to Brady.<a name="fnref11" class="fn" href="#fn11">11</a></p><p class="Bodycopy">Prior to the trial, Mr. Cousin's defense team filed a motion to suppress Ms.
Babin's identification of Mr. Cousin. Ms. Babin testified at the suppression hearing,&nbsp;
and, in response to questions by respondent, explained the manner by which she came
to identify Mr. Cousin in the photographic lineup conducted by the NOPD. On cross examination,
Mr. Cousin's attorney questioned Ms. Babin as to whether she had
given a description of the perpetrator to the police &quot;when they questioned you about
this case.&quot; Ms. Babin testified she described the perpetrator as youthful, slim, slightly
shorter than Mr. Gerardi, with short cropped hair and a very distinctive &quot;unusual&quot; or &quot;evil-looking&quot; face. Mr. Cousin's attorney also asked whether Ms. Babin told the
police &quot;about any characteristics that you felt were outstanding.&quot; Ms. Babin said that
she could only recall stating &quot;that he had an older-looking face on a younger body.&quot;
While Mr. Cousin's attorney attempted to discover whether or not Ms. Babin had
given any additional descriptions to anyone else prior to the photographic lineup,
respondent objected, and the question was rephrased. Eventually, Mr. Cousin's
attorney questioned Ms. Babin as to whether she had provided any additional
statements to the police other than the night of the murder (Statement 1) and the
photographic lineup (Statement 3). Ms. Babin testified that her description had been
consistent throughout. Thus, the only way that the defense could have known about
Statement 2 would have been disclosure by respondent.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Ms. Babin testified at trial and repeated her positive identification of Mr.
Cousin. Mr. Cousin was convicted of first degree murder. The same jury
subsequently sentenced him to death in a bifurcated penalty phase.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Several days after the completion of the guilt phase of the trial but before the
penalty phase, a copy of Statement 2 was delivered anonymously to defense counsel.
On appeal, the defense raised as error respondent's failure to produce Statement 2
prior to trial. This Court did not reach that issue. Instead, a unanimous Court
reversed Mr. Cousin's conviction and death sentence based on the erroneous
admission of a witness' testimony as impeachment evidence and respondent's
improper use of that evidence in closing argument. <span class="cite">State v. Cousin, 96-2973 p. 16
(La. 4/14/98), 710 So. 2d 1065, 1073</span>. Nevertheless, the Court commented in
footnotes that Ms. Babin's second statement was &quot;obviously&quot; exculpatory, material
to the issue of guilt, and &quot;clearly&quot; should have been produced to the defense under
Brady and <span class="cite">Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995)</span>.
Cousin, 96-2973 p. 2 n. 2, 710 So.2d at 1066 and 96-2973 p. 17 n.8, 710 So.2d at
1073.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Following this court's decision in Cousin, the Orleans Parish District
Attorney's Office elected not to retry Mr. Cousin for the murder of Michael Gerardi.</p><h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2><h3>DISCIPLINARY COMPLAINT</h3><p class="Bodycopy">In May 1998, Mr. Cousin and his sister, Tonya Cropper, filed a complaint
against respondent with the ODC, alleging, among other things, that respondent
wrongfully suppressed Brady evidence by failing to disclose Ms. Babin's second
statement. In his July 1998 response to the complaint, respondent asserted his belief
that the witness's statement at issue was more inculpatory than exculpatory, and his
determination that disclosure of the statement was not required by Brady.
Respondent reiterated this assertion in his sworn statement taken by the ODC on June
16, 1999.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Following its investigation, the ODC dismissed the complaint against
respondent. Ms. Cropper appealed the dismissal, but the hearing committee found
that the ODC did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint. Subsequently,
the disciplinary board remanded the matter to the ODC with instructions to file formal
charges against respondent.</p><h3>FORMAL HEARING</h3><p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee conducted a formal hearing on the charges. ODC called<br>
several witnesses in its case in chief, including respondent, Shareef Cousin's defense<br>
attorney, and the complainant, Tonya Cropper. Respondent presented character<br>
testimony from several members of the bench and bar.</p><h4><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-03-18_03-DB-023.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h4><p class="Bodycopy">In a split decision, the chair and the public member of the committee found that
the ODC did not prove a violation of Rules 3.8(d) and 8.4(a) as charged, and
recommended that the formal charges against respondent be dismissed. In a nineteen
page report, the majority found respondent's testimony credible regarding the nature
of the Brady material. The committee acknowledged that respondent was in
possession of the statement yet failed to disclose the second statement to the defense.
However, the committee found no violation of Rule 3.8, as the committee determined
that respondent reasonably believed that Ms. Babin's statement was inculpatory rather
than exculpatory. The committee concluded that the defense was aware of the second
statement and that it did not believe that the prosecution had an obligation &quot;to help
out the defense&quot; by providing the statement. Based on these factual determinations,
the majority of the committee concluded that respondent did not violate the Rules of
Professional Conduct.</p><p class="Bodycopy">The lawyer member of the committee dissented, noting her objection to the
majority's interpretation of a prosecutor's duty under Brady. She commented that she
did not believe that the prosecutor has the discretion to determine whether to disclose
exculpatory evidence to the defense. Rather, she interpreted Brady as imposing an
affirmative duty on the prosecutor to disclose material exculpatory evidence,
irrespective of whether a request was made by the defense.</p><p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's report and
recommendation.</p><h4><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-08-30_03-DB-023.htm">Ruling of the Disciplinary Board</a></span></h4><p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board determined that respondent technically violated the
Rules of Professional Conduct, but found that no discipline was appropriate and
dismissed the formal charges against respondent. While the board adopted the
hearing committee's factual findings, it rejected the committee's legal conclusions
and application of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The board determined that the
committee erred in its finding that respondent did not violate either Brady or Rule
3.8(d) when he failed to produce Ms. Babin's second statement. The board
concluded that respondent was ethically bound to voluntarily disclose Statement 2,
which tended to negate the guilt of the accused by calling into question Ms. Babin's
positive identification of Cousin as the perpetrator of the crime. By failing to do so,
respondent violated Rule 3.8(d).</p><p class="Bodycopy">The board found no aggravating factors present in this case, but found &quot;numerous and weighty&quot; mitigating factors, including the absence of a prior
disciplinary record, absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, full and free disclosure
to the disciplinary board and a cooperative attitude toward the proceedings, character
and reputation, and remorse. The board concluded:</p><blockquote>
  <p>While the board finds that respondent's actions constitute
a technical violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct,
considering all of the factors, particularly respondent's
good faith and lack of intent, the lack of any actual injury,
respondent's excellent reputation among judges and
colleagues and his unblemished disciplinary record, and
considering the purpose of lawyer discipline, the board
finds that no formal discipline is warranted. See, <span class="cite">In re
Hartley, 2003-2828 (La. 4/2/2004), <a href="2004-04-02_2003-2828.htm">869 So.2d 799</a></span>.
[internal footnote omitted]</p></blockquote>

<p class="Bodycopy">Based on this reasoning, the formal charges against respondent were dismissed. </p><p class="Bodycopy">The ODC sought review of the board's ruling in this Court. We ordered the
parties to submit briefs addressing the issue of whether the record supports the
disciplinary board's report. After reviewing the briefs filed by both parties, we
docketed the matter for oral argument.<a name="fnref12" class="fn" href="#fn12">12</a></p><h2>DISCUSSION</h2><p class="Bodycopy">In our system of justice, we entrust vast discretion to a prosecutor. <span class="cite">In re Toups,
2000-0634 p. 10 (La. 11/28/00), <a href="2000-11-28_2000-0634.htm">773 So.2d 709</a>, 715</span>. Because a prosecutor is given
such great power and discretion, he is also charged with a high ethical standard. Id.
A prosecutor stands as the representative of the people of the State of Louisiana. He
is entrusted with upholding the integrity of the criminal justice system by ensuring
that justice is served for both the victims of crimes and the accused. &quot;Society wins
not only when the guilty are convicted but when criminal trials are fair; our system
of the administration of justice suffers when any accused is treated unfairly.&quot; Brady,
373 U.S. at 87. The actions, or inactions in this case, of the prosecutor are paramount
to a fair administration of justice; and the people of this state must have confidence
in a prosecutor's integrity in performing his duty to disclose exculpatory evidence in
order for the system to be just. Any intentional deviation from the principle of the
fair administration of justice will be dealt with harshly by this Court.</p><p class="Bodycopy">This is a case of first impression in the State of Louisiana. Never before have
we been confronted with the issue of disciplining a prosecutor for failing to disclose &quot;evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the
accused or mitigates the offense, and, in connection with sentencing, disclose to the
defense and to the tribunal all unprivileged mitigating information known to the
prosecutor.&quot; Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.8(d). The language of Rule
3.8(d) is recognizably similar to the prosecutor's duty set forth in Brady, supra, and
its progeny. Moreover, the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure likewise imposes
a corresponding statutory duty on a prosecutor to disclose exculpatory evidence to the
defendant. See La.C.Cr.P. arts. 718, 719(A) and 722; <span class="cite">State v. Edwards, 99-0911 p.
2 (La. 9/24/99), 746 So.2d 1267, 1268</span>.</p><p class="Bodycopy">The duty of a prosecutor to disclose exculpatory evidence is embedded in the
principle that a criminal defendant is deprived of a fair trial when the state withholds
exculpatory evidence that is material to guilt or punishment. The state's failure to
disclose material evidence favorable to a criminal defendant implicates more than the
defendant's discovery rights; the prosecutor has an affirmative duty to disclose such
evidence under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Failure to reveal
this evidence implicates the defendant's right to a fair trial. <span class="cite">United States v. Agurs,
427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976)</span>; <span class="cite">State v. Marshall, 94-0461 p.12
(La. 9/5/95), 660 So.2d 819, 825</span>.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Whether the questioned evidence is material under Brady has been explained
by this Court in Marshall, 94-0461 p. 16 (La. 9/5/95), 660 So.2d 819, 826:</p><blockquote>
  <p>The issue is whether the exculpatory evidence is material under the
Brady-Bagley-Kyles line of cases. Evidence is material only if it is
reasonably probable that the result of the proceeding would have been
different had the evidence been disclosed to the defense. A reasonable
probability is one which is sufficient to undermine confidence in the
outcome. Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. at 3383. This Court must
provide a cumulative evaluation of the suppressed evidence, keeping in
mind that Marshall does not have to show that, with the addition of the
suppressed evidence, his trial would have resulted in acquittal or that
there would be an insufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction.
Marshall need only show that &quot;disclosure of the suppressed evidence to
competent counsel would have made a different result reasonably
probable.&quot; Kyles, 514 U.S. at 440.</p></blockquote>

<p class="Bodycopy">During his testimony before the hearing committee, respondent testified that
he did not believe Ms. Babin's second statement was material and did not qualify as
the type of evidence to be disclosed under Brady. Specifically, respondent stated that
he thought the evidence was inculpatory rather than exculpatory as Ms. Babin
recounted specific details regarding the defendant's clothing and colorful socks.
While the definition of materiality set forth in Kyles and its progeny may be seen as
leaving a prosecutor with a degree of discretion, it does not. Kyles, 514 U.S. at 438.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Exculpatory evidence includes evidence which impeaches the testimony of a
witness whose credibility or reliability may determine guilt or innocence. Giglio v.
United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed. 104 (1972). Additionally, United
States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3380, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985),
reiterates the principle that there is no distinction between exculpatory evidence and
impeachment evidence under Brady. Clearly, Ms. Babin's second statement negates
her ability to positively identify the defendant in a lineup. The statement should have
been disclosed to the defense. See State v. Cousin, 96-2973 (La. 4/14/98), 710 So.2d
1065. As we noted in our decision overruling Mr. Cousin's conviction, citing Justice
Souter's eloquent statement in Kyles, a prosecutor anxious about &quot;tacking too close
to the wind will disclose a favorable piece of evidence&quot; and &quot;will resolve doubtful
questions in favor of disclosure.&quot; Cousin, 96-2973 p. 17 n. 8, 710 So.2d at 1073 n.8,
citing Kyles, 514 U.S. at 439. Respondent failed to produce evidence which was
clearly exculpatory and should have resolved this issue in favor of disclosure.
Accordingly, we agree with the factual findings of the disciplinary board that
respondent violated Rule 3.8(d) by failing to disclose the second statement of Ms.
Babin to the defendant.</p><h2>SANCTIONS</h2><p class="Bodycopy">La. Const. art. V, § 5(B) confers original jurisdiction over attorney disciplinary
matters to this Court.<a name="fnref13" class="fn" href="#fn13">13</a> Having found respondent violated Rule 3.8(d) of the Rules
of Professional Conduct, the sole remaining issue is the discipline to be imposed.
In considering the issue of sanctions, we are mindful that disciplinary
proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public,
preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. Louisiana State
Bar Ass'n v. Reis, 513 So.2d 1173 (La.1987). The discipline to be imposed depends
upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered
in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Louisiana State Bar Ass'n
v. Whittington, 459 So.2d 520 (La.1984). Thus, we must consider the facts as they
are presented herein in deciding the type of discipline to impose on respondent.
The violation of Rule 3.8(d) by a prosecutor raises a great deal of concern to
this Court. Rule 3.8(d) exists to ensure that the integrity of the prosecutorial arm of
our criminal justice system is maintained. Moreover, prosecutors are in a unique
position from other members of the bar as they are immune from civil liability under
Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). Neither are
they realistically subject to criminal sanctions. Our research reveals only one instance
in which a judge held a prosecutor in contempt of court for failing to disclose
evidence. See In re Burns, 2001-1080 (La. 11/28/01), 800 So.2d 833.<a name="fnref14" class="fn" href="#fn14">14</a> Thus, absent
consequences being imposed by this Court under its authority over disciplinary
matters, prosecutors face no realistic consequences for Brady violations.<a name="fnref15" class="fn" href="#fn15">15</a></p><p class="Bodycopy">In deciding the appropriate sanction, we begin our analysis with Supreme Court
Rule XIX, § 10(C), which sets forth the following considerations in imposing
discipline:</p><blockquote>
  <p class="inverted">1. Whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a
client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the
profession;</p><p class="inverted">2. Whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly,
or negligently;</p><p class="inverted">3. The amount of the actual or potential injury caused
by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p><p class="inverted">4. The existence of any aggravating or mitigating
factors.</p></blockquote>

<p class="Bodycopy">By withholding material exculpatory evidence from a criminal defendant,
respondent violated a duty owed to the public. As a prosecutor, respondent is
charged with a high ethical standard and may not carelessly skirt his obligation. See
In re Toups, supra. Although neither Brady nor Rule 3.8 incorporates a mental
element, Rule XIX, §10(C) does. Based on the testimony of respondent and the
character evidence discussed below, we find that respondent knowingly withheld
Brady evidence.<a name="fnref16" class="fn" href="#fn16">16</a> As to the element regarding actual injury, this Court reversed
Shareef Cousin's conviction on other grounds and granted him a new trial. However,
this Court's actions in reversing the conviction does not vitiate the potential injury
to the criminal justice system, or to Cousin, caused by respondent's actions, and
warrants serious consideration and discipline by this Court.</p><p class="Bodycopy">As to the issue of aggravating and mitigating factors, we find the only
aggravating factor present in this case is respondent's substantial experience as a
prosecutor. However, on the issue of mitigation, we find a host of factors present.
Specifically, we find the absence of any prior disciplinary record, absence of a
dishonest motive, full and free disclosure to the board, a cooperative attitude towards
the proceedings, and good character and reputation in the legal community. </p><p class="Bodycopy">As stated above, the issue of discipline against a prosecutor for his violation
of Rule 3.8 is res nova in the State of Louisiana. While this Court has the benefit of
Rule XIX considerations, we have no prior case law on the issue. However,
Louisiana is not the first jurisdiction to address the issue of a prosecutor's failure to
disclose evidence to a defendant. Our brethren in North Carolina, Kansas, South
Carolina, Ohio and Iowa have imposed discipline against an attorney who fails to
disclose evidence pursuant to Brady. Thus, we find some guidance in their decisions. </p><p class="Bodycopy">The sanctions imposed in other jurisdictions range from public reprimand or
censure to a six-month suspension from the practice of law.<a name="fnref17" class="fn" href="#fn17">17</a> Based upon the facts
of this case, we conclude the appropriate baseline sanction for respondent's
misconduct is a three-month suspension from the practice of law. However, in light
of the mitigating factors, we will defer this suspension in its entirety, subject to the
condition that any misconduct during a one-year period following the finality of this
judgment may be grounds for making the deferred suspension executory, or imposing
additional discipline, as appropriate.</p><h2>DECREE</h2><p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee
and disciplinary board, and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is
ordered that Roger W. Jordan, Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 19642, be suspended
from the practice of law for a period of three months. It is further ordered that the
suspension shall be deferred in its entirety, subject to the condition that any
misconduct by respondent during a one-year period following the date of finality of
this court's judgment may be grounds for making the deferred suspension executory,
or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate. All costs and expenses in the matter
are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1,
with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's
judgment until paid.</p>

Throughout this opinion, we refer to the exculpatory evidence as &quot;Brady&quot; material,
referring to the landmark United States Supreme Court case of Brady v. Maryland, supra, which held
&quot;the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due
process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith
or bad faith of the prosecution.&quot;</p><p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn10" class="fn" href="#fnref10">10</a> As the &quot;senior assistant&quot; prosecuting the Cousin case, it was totally within respondent's

The record contains a letter dated January 5, 1998, authored by the Honorable Calvin
Johnson of Orleans Parish Criminal Court addressed to Orleans Parish District Attorney Harry
Connick. This letter voices concern over the increase in violations of Rule 3.8(d) by &quot;some of your
assistant district attorneys.&quot; Judge Johnson reiterates that Rule 3.8 was established to ensure not
only professional responsibility but also to ensure a criminal defendant's right to due process. He
warns that the court will hold the assistant district attorney personally responsible for failure to
disclose Brady evidence and will report the assistant to the Disciplinary Counsel to &quot;prosecute that
individual to the fullest extent possible.&quot; A copy of this letter was hand delivered to the respondent.
See Exhibit D.</p><p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn15" class="fn" href="#fnref15">15</a> We strenuously note here today that we do not suggest that the withholding of Brady
evidence is a prevalent practice amongst prosecutors in the State of Louisiana. Rather, we believe

<hr><div id="dissentJohnson"><p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 04-B-2397</p>
  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: ROGER W. JORDAN, JR.</p>
  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
  <p class="headingstyle">JOHNSON, J. concurs in part, dissents in part, for the reasons that
  follow.</p>
  <p class="Bodycopy">I concur in the majority's opinion that respondent knowingly withheld Brady
  evidence, that respondent's experience as a prosecutor was an aggravating factor, that
  the Court's actions in reversing defendant's conviction failed to invalidate the
  potential injury to the criminal justice system, or to defendant, and that respondent's
  behavior warrants discipline by this Court. However, because of the actual injury
  caused by respondent's prosecutorial misconduct, I dissent from the majority's
  conclusion that respondent's suspension should be deferred.</p>
  <p class="Bodycopy">As cited in the majority opinion, Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10(c)
  sets forth four factors to be considered when imposing lawyer discipline. The third
  factor in this analysis is the &quot;amount of the actual or potential injury caused by the
  lawyer's misconduct.&quot; Regarding actual injury, the majority opinion states that &quot;this
  Court reversed Shareef Cousin's conviction on other grounds and granted him a new
  trial.&quot; Thus, the majority opinion adopts the reasoning, stated explicitly by the
  disciplinary board in the lower proceedings, that no injury resulted from respondent's
  conduct since the defendant's conviction was reversed. Although reversal of
  defendant's sentence of death by lethal injection amends the wrongful sentence, it
  fails to negate the actual injury caused by respondent's misconduct.</p>
  <p class="Bodycopy">Pursuant to Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10(c), this court has held
  that an attorney caused an actual injury because the attorney's failure to pay a client's
  medical bill resulted in a negative report to a credit agency. In re Felicia Nicole
  Graham, 2001-2930 (La. 2/8/02), 807 So.2d 829, 832. In another matter, we
  determined that an attorney caused an actual injury when he abandoned his legal
  practice and failed to return a $750 fee to a client and delayed the client's legal
  proceedings. In re James Ashley Vaughan, 2001-1948 (La. 10/26/01), 801 So.2d
  1058, 1060-1061. In my view, the taking of a liberty interest is an even greater
  injury. As one legal commentator noted, &quot;liberty is absolute and the loss of it is the
  greatest of all human injustices.&quot;<a name="disfnref1" class="fn" href="#disfn1">1</a> Indeed, how can we ignore the injury caused by the
  wrongful taking of freedom, or the despair that inevitably follows as a defendant sits
  on death row and prepares for execution by lethal injection. &quot;The execution of a
  legally and factually innocent person would be a constitutionally intolerable event,&quot;
  wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 113 S.Ct.
  853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993). It is noteworthy that Shareef Cousin faced this
  predicament at the age of sixteen. The United States Supreme Court has since
  determined that execution of individuals who were under the age of 18 at the time of
  their capital crimes is unconstitutional. Roper v. Simmons, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161
  L.Ed.2d 1 (2005).</p><p class="Bodycopy">Wrongful conviction constitutes an actual injury.<a name="disfnref2" class="fn" href="#disfn2">2</a> Moreover, the United States
  Supreme Court has held that a wrongful conviction &quot;has continuing collateral
  consequences.&quot; Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed. 2d 43
  (1998). Michael Anthony Williams, who was recently freed from Angola State
  Penitentiary after serving 24 years for a crime he did not commit, and who, like
  Shareef Cousin, was convicted at the age of sixteen, described his time in prison as
  &quot;a living hell.&quot;<a name="disfnref3" class="fn" href="#disfn3">3</a> He stated that &quot;a lot of terrible things happened to me while I was
  in there.<a name="disfnref4" class="fn" href="#disfn4">4</a>&quot; Williams confessed that when he was younger, he was sexually abused
  &quot;while guards turned their backs.&quot;<a name="disfnref5" class="fn" href="#disfn5">5</a> Persons wrongfully convicted lose time during incarceration that cannot be retrieved. Furthermore, inmates, generally, leave prison
  with no savings, dismal employment prospects, and oftentimes medical and mental
  issues.<a name="disfnref6" class="fn" href="#disfn6">6</a> Wrongful conviction can also cause significant stress on family relationships
  including the financial pressure that may have been created by legal fees associated
  with the wrongful conviction.</p><p class="Bodycopy">In the present case, disciplinary charges were filed against respondent by
  Shareef Cousin<a name="disfnref7" class="fn" href="#disfn7">7</a> and his sister, Tonya Cropper. Tonya Cropper's testimony at the&nbsp; Hearing Committee describes the emotional turmoil that the Cousin family endured
  as a result of defendant's wrongful conviction.<a name="disfnref8" class="fn" href="#disfn8">8</a></p><p class="Bodycopy">In 1976, the United States Supreme Court held that individual prosecutors have
  absolute immunity under common law tort claims as well as section 1983 suits.
  Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). This court
  adopted the Imbler court's reasoning in Knapper v. Connick, when we determined
  that &quot;prosecutors are entitled to absolute immunity for conduct within the course and
  scope of their prosecutorial functions...&quot; Knapper v. Connick, 96-0434 (La.
  10/15/1996), 681 So.2d 944, 950. Thus, prosecutors have absolute immunity even
  in instances, such as the present case, where the prosecutor suppressed exculpatory
  information. Knapper v. Connick, 681 So.2d at 949-950. However, the Imbler,
  supra, decision also identifies the legal community's responsibility for maintaining
  the integrity of prosecutors and deterring prosecutors from violating standards of the
  legal profession. The court concluded that &quot;a prosecutor stands perhaps unique,
  among officials whose acts could deprive persons of constitutional rights, in his
  amenability to professional discipline by an association of his peers.&quot; Id. at 429.
  Therefore, our function in dispensing disciplinary action is critical both for upholding
  the highest ethical and professional standards among prosecutors and ensuring
  fundamental fairness for defendants. As expressed by the Honorable Calvin Johnson
  of Orleans Parish Criminal Court, in a letter contained in the record to then Orleans
  Parish District Attorney Harry Connick,<a name="disfnref9" class="fn" href="#disfn9">9</a> Rule 3.8 was established to ensure
  professional responsibility among lawyers as well as to guarantee the constitutional
  due process rights of criminal defendants.<a name="disfnref10" class="fn" href="#disfn">10</a></p><p class="Bodycopy">In determining whether respondent caused an actual injury pursuant to
  Louisiana's Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10(c), our focus should be on the
  unnecessary and unlawful suffering of the wrongfully convicted<a name="disfnref11" class="fn" href="#disfn11">11</a> as a result of the
  prosecutorial misconduct, not just the reversal of the wrongfully imposed sentence.
  Because, in my view, loss of a liberty interest is more valuable than financial loss or
  injury to one's credit, I would impose an actual period of suspension.</p>

  41 AM. CRIM. L. REV. 157, n. 125 (2004).<p class="footnotetext"><a name="disfn7" class="fn" href="#disfnref7">7</a> There is no direct testimony from Shareef Cousin regarding the impact of his wrongful
  death sentence.<p class="footnotetext"><a name="disfn8" class="fn" href="#disfnref8">8</a> Cropper now resides in Boston, Massachusetts but at the time of the conviction and
  sentencing, she resided in Plano, Texas. During the trial Cropper drove from Plano and
  stayed through the duration of the trial. Cropper testified that after the conviction and
  sentencing she was numbed by the whole procedure. She couldn't believe that her
  brother was going to die. During this time her family was bitter with the justice system;
  they still hold resentment towards the courts.<p class="footnotetext">Cropper said that Roger Jordan's insistence on the guilt of her brother infuriated her. On the Geraldo talk show, it was Jordan's face that represented her brother's conviction and death sentence. Even after the dismissal of the charges, she stated that Jordan continued to 
  insist on the guilt of her brother.<p class="footnotetext">Cropper expressed how she was too angry, hurt, and confused to testify during the penalty phase of the trial. She told how her brother had an outburst of emotion in court during Jordan's closing statement. The same emotional fury flowed through her veins. After the denial of a new trial, 
  she, her four sisters, and her mother had an emotional, tear-filled prayer with Cousin before he was sent to Angola State Penitentiary. As he was taken away from his family, Cousin cried for the first time since the ordeal began.<p class="footnotetext">She tells how she hated to see her brother in jail, and how she had only visited him once since 
  he was initially arrested for the murder. She spent a lot of time dwelling on the fact that her brother was going to die of lethal injection. She finally decided to subject herself to seeing her brother behind bars.<p class="footnotetext">Cropper goes on to tell of the travel accommodations that had to be made so the whole family would have an 
  opportunity to see her brother in jail. She drove eight hours from Texas to pick her sisters and mom up; none of them had a car. The family would then travel two and a half hours to Angola. After the visit she would transport her family back to New Orleans. She would then rest for several hours and then drive back to Texas. This was all in one 
  day. She made the trip faithfully every month until Cousin was removed from death row. Her daughter also had to endure seeing her uncle in jail. She never wanted her child to think her uncle was a murderer.<p class="footnotetext">She felt Jordan had no regard for her family or for her brothers rights because her brother was arrested for four 
  separate counts of armed robbery. She believes Jordan thought no one cared about her brother and he could do anything to win at all cost, regardless of her brother's due process rights. Her brother believed his attorney who told him that the robbery plea bargain was in his best interest because the judge was going to try him (and sentence him) on 
  each count separately, and he would have to serve two times the sentence he is currently serving if found guilty of those robberies separately. See Hearing Committee Transcripts page 200, lines 8-15. Cropper did not understand why Jordan seemed to feel that her brother's life was so disposable.<p class="footnotetext">Cropper explained that an 
  injustice has been done not only to the Cousin family but also to the victim, Gerardi's, family because that family has no closure in the death of their son.<p class="footnotetext"><a name="disfn9" class="fn" href="#disfnref9">9</a>
  The letter is referenced in the majority opinion.<p class="footnotetext"><a name="disfn10" class="fn" href="#disfnref11">10</a> In addition to the actual injury caused by respondent's violation of Rule 3.8, there are
  other allegations of misconduct cited in the complaint, though no formal charges were
  brought by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. Specifically, during testimony at a motion
  for new trial, it was alleged that Jordan's co-counsel, Assistant District Attorney Byron
  Berry, may have removed several of defendant's alibi witnesses from outside the
  courtroom to the District Attorney's office. Later, when the time came for those
  witnesses to be called, respondent failed to tell defense counsel where the witnesses were. <p class="footnotetext">Furthermore, there are some concerns with defendant's guilty pleas to armed robbery.
  Cousin was arrested and charged with First Degree Murder on Marcy 27, 1995. This is
  the arrest for the instant matter. The next day, March 28, 1995, Cousin was arrested and
  charged with four counts of armed robbery. Cousin pled guilty to the armed robberies
  before he was found guilty of murder, but after he had been arrested and charged with the
  crime.<p class="footnotetext">Cousin later petitioned this Court to grant supervisory writs and order post-conviction
  relief for the judgments entered against him in the armed robbery cases. In his writ
  application, Cousin argued that his guilty plea had been involuntary since he was never
  advised of the consequences of his plea. He claimed that he had not been apprised that
  his guilty plea would be used against him as four aggravating factors in the penalty phase
  of his capital trial. Additionally, he argued that he was not told that his guilty plea would
  prevent him from testifying in his capital trial, as the &quot;prior&quot; convictions would be used to
  impeach him if he got on the stand. This court denied defendant's application for writ of
  certiorari. J. Johnson dissented, stating that she was &quot;not convinced that (Cousin)
  understood the consequences of his guilty pleas.&quot; State v. Cousin, 98-3197
  (La.1/6/1999), 734 So.2d 645.<p class="footnotetext"><a name="disfn11" class="fn" href="#disfnref11">11</a> According to the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern Law School, the

  Also, See generally, Jim Dwyer, Peter Neufeld, and Barry Scheck, Actual Innocence,
  (2000). The authors tell the stories of persons they have helped who have been exonerated
  through the use of DNA evidence. The authors state that the &quot;emphatic belief of
  witnesses, police, and prosecutors in the correctness of their accusations  even in the
  face of undeniable evidence of innocence  drills into issues at the marrow of humanity.&quot;
