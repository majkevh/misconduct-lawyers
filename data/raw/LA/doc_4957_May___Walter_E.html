  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that
  respondent made inappropriate extrajudicial statements concerning the handling of a pending criminal case by the
  judge to whom the case was assigned. Prior to the filing of formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint
  petition for consent discipline, in which respondent admits that his conduct was prejudicial to the administration of
  justice, in violation of Rule <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Having reviewed the petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Walter Edward May,
  Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 9120, be publicly reprimanded.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that respondent shall enroll in and attend the Ethics School program
  offered by the Louisiana State Bar Association's Practice Assistance and Improvement Committee.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
