<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>NO. 02-B-0279</p>

<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>IN RE: ROXANNE D. ANDRUS</p>

<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">PER CURIAM</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from a petition for consent discipline filed by 
respondent, Roxanne D. Andrus, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State 
of Louisiana but currently on interim suspension.<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> The Office of Disciplinary 
Counsel (“ODC”) concurred in respondent’s petition, and the disciplinary board 
recommended the proposed consent discipline be accepted.</p>

<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">Two sets of formal charges were filed against respondent by the ODC. The first, 
00-DB-117, was filed on September 15, 2000 and encompasses seven counts of 
misconduct. The second, 01-DB-018, was filed on February 8, 2001 and encompasses 
five counts of misconduct. The two sets of formal charges were consolidated in 
the disciplinary board after the filing of the petition for consent discipline.</p>

<h3>00-DB-117</h3>

<h4>The Cormier Matter</h4>

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was retained to handle a personal injury matter for Barbara Cormier. 
Ms. Cormier requested an accounting when the case settled in December 1996; 
however, respondent failed to comply with this request. Respondent failed to pay 
Ms. Cormier’s medical expenses in a timely fashion, doing so as late as February 
1998. In addition, respondent failed to pay costs due to the clerk of court, 
forcing Ms. Cormier to do so. Finally, respondent charged her client $4,500 in 
expenses and investigative fees for which she was unable to account. </p>

<h4>The Baker Matter</h4>

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was retained to handle a personal injury matter for Theresa Baker. 
When the case settled in September 1998, respondent withheld the sum of $2,106 
to pay Ms. Baker’s medical providers. However, as late as April 1999, one 
provider, Dr. Duplantis, had not been paid. Respondent’s trust account records 
indicate that the account was overdrawn, then closed.</p>

<h4>The Simmons Matter</h4>

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was retained to handle a personal injury matter for Lakendra Simmons 
and her brother, Claude Simmons. Respondent failed to adequately communicate 
with her clients and missed scheduled appointments. The case settled in January 
1998; however, respondent failed to pay her clients’ medical expenses in a 
timely fashion, doing so as late as November 1998. Respondent charged her 
clients inflated expenses, in particular $350 each (above and beyond the 
contingency fee) for legal work. </p>

<h4>The Chaisson Matter</h4>

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was retained to handle a personal injury matter for Keisha Chaisson. 
Respondent failed to adequately communicate with her client and failed to keep 
her aware of the progress of her case. When the case against one defendant 
settled in July 1998, respondent withheld sums to pay Ms. Chaisson’s medical 
providers; however, she failed to do so. Respondent’s trust account records 
indicate that the account was overdrawn, then closed.</p>

<h4>The Saloom Matter</h4>

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent represented several personal injury clients who were referred to Dr. 
Saloom for medical treatment. However, respondent failed to pay Dr. Saloom 
timely when the clients’ cases settled. For example, respondent settled the 
Chevis case in December 1997, but she did not pay the medical expenses in full 
until May 1999. Respondent settled the Alexander, Watson, Issac, and Thomas 
cases between July and December 1998, but the clients’ medical expenses were not 
paid in full until April 1999. In addition, respondent charged her clients 
inflated expenses. Respondent’s trust account records indicate that the account 
was overdrawn, then closed.</p>

<h4>The Ducharme Matter</h4>

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was retained to handle a personal injury matter for Edward Ducharme. 
Respondent failed to adequately communicate with her client and failed to keep 
him aware of the progress of his case. Respondent also failed to diligently 
pursue the matter and settled Mr. Ducharme’s claims prematurely in August 1998. 
Nevertheless, respondent did not disburse to Mr. Ducharme his portion of the 
settlement, nor did she keep the funds protected in her trust account, despite 
her assertions to the contrary. In fact, respondent’s trust account records 
indicate that the account was overdrawn, then closed.</p>

<h4>The Hyatt Matter</h4>

<p class="Bodycopy">Carol Hyatt paid respondent $2,560 to handle a criminal appeal on behalf of her 
son. Respondent failed to adequately communicate with her client and performed 
little or no work in the matter. Ms. Hyatt subsequently requested an accounting 
or a refund of the unearned portion of the fee; however, respondent failed to 
comply with either request.<br>
A copy of Ms. Hyatt’s complaint to the ODC was forwarded to respondent by 
certified mail in April 2000. Respondent did not answer the complaint until May 
2000.</p>

<h3>01-DB-018</h3>

<h4>The Felton Francis Matter</h4>

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was retained by Felton and Sara Francis to handle various legal 
matters on their behalf. Respondent failed to adequately communicate with her 
clients and failed to keep them aware of the progress of their cases. Respondent 
also failed to diligently pursue the matters she had been retained to handle. 
For example, Mr. and Mrs. Francis borrowed money to purchase a car from 
respondent’s father. Respondent promised to pay the loan back out of settlement 
proceeds due Mr. and Mrs. Francis, but she failed to do so. As a result, Mr. and 
Mrs. Francis were sued by the creditor. Respondent also failed to cooperate in 
the ODC’s investigation of the complaint filed by Mr. and Mrs. Francis. In 
particular, the ODC served respondent personally with a subpoena compelling her 
to appear on December 7, 2000 and provide information under oath concerning the 
complaint. Respondent failed to appear.</p>

medical providers; however, she failed to do so. Respondent also did not 
disburse to Ms. Noel her portion of the settlement, nor did she keep the funds 
protected in her trust account. In fact, respondent’s trust account records 
indicate that the account was overdrawn, then closed. Respondent thereafter 
refused to communicate with Ms. Noel concerning the settlement. Finally, 
respondent failed to cooperate in the ODC’s investigation of the complaint filed 
by Ms. Noel.</p>

<h4>The LeBlanc Matter</h4>

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent settled a personal injury matter she handled for Cicily LeBlanc. 
However, respondent did not disburse to Ms. LeBlanc her portion of the 
settlement, nor did she keep the funds protected in her trust account. In fact, 
respondent’s trust account records indicate that the account was overdrawn, then 
closed. Respondent thereafter refused to communicate with Ms. LeBlanc concerning 
the settlement. Respondent also failed to cooperate in the ODC’s investigation 
of the complaint filed by Ms. LeBlanc.</p>

Francis. However, respondent did not disburse to Mr. and Mrs. Francis their 
portion of the settlement, nor did she keep the funds protected in her trust 
account. In fact, respondent’s trust account records indicate that the account 
was overdrawn, then closed. In addition, respondent wrote a check on her trust 
account and gave it to the Francis’ prior attorney, Kyle Gideon, who had 
requested that respondent withhold funds from the settlement to reimburse him 
for his attorney’s fees and medical expenses he had paid. This check was 
returned for insufficient funds. Respondent thereafter refused to communicate 
with Mr. Gideon or Mr. and Mrs. Francis. Finally, respondent failed to cooperate 
in the ODC’s investigation of the complaint filed in this matter. </p>

<h4>The Walker Matter</h4>

the progress of her case. Respondent also failed to diligently pursue the matter 
she had been retained to handle, yet refused to refund the unearned portion of 
the fee. Finally, respondent failed to cooperate in the ODC’s investigation of 
Ms. Walker’s complaint.</p>

<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">The consolidated formal charges filed against respondent allege that her conduct 
constitutes a violation of Rules <span class="Rules">
<a class="AllRules" href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.1 --#">1.1</a></span> (failure to provide competent 
representation to a client), <span class="Rules">
<a class="AllRules" href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.3 --#">1.3</a></span> (failure to act with diligence and promptness 
in representing a client), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.4 --#">1.4</a></span> (failure to communicate with a client), 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.5 --#">1.5</a></span> (fee

clients or third persons), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.16 --#">1.16</a></span> (termination of the representation), 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE3.2 --#">3.2</a></span> 
(failure to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation), <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.1 --#">8.1</a></span>(c) (failure to

<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a></span>(a) (violation of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct), and <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a></span>(g) (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its 
investigation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. </p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Prior to a formal hearing in the consolidated matters, respondent filed a 
petition for consent discipline, admitting the factual allegations set forth in 
the formal charges and proposing the imposition of disbarment. The ODC concurred 
in the petition.</p>

<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-018.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>

<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board found that respondent’s actions were negligent in part, 
knowing in part, and intentional in part. As a result of respondent’s 
misconduct, her clients, the legal system, the public, and the profession have 
been injured. Many clients and third parties have been deprived of settlement 
funds, unearned fees, or fees for services provided. The board noted that some 
medical providers have received payment, though late. Although no aggravating or 
mitigating factors are set forth in the petition for consent discipline, the 
board determined that the following aggravating factors are present in this 
matter: multiple offenses, dishonest or selfish motive, pattern of misconduct, 
vulnerability of the victims, and indifference to making restitution. The sole 
mitigating factor present is respondent’s lack of a prior disciplinary record. 
Considering the ABA’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions and the prior 
jurisprudence of this court dealing with similar misconduct, the board found 
disbarment is the only appropriate sanction in this case.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, the board recommended the court accept the petition for consent 
discipline and disbar respondent from the practice of law. The board further 
recommended that respondent be ordered to make restitution to her clients and 
third parties. Finally, the board recommended that respondent be assessed with 
all costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence 
thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s judgment until paid. </p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board’s 
recommendation.</p>

<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">Although this matter arises from a petition for consent discipline, 
<span class="AllRules">Supreme 
Court Rule XIX, § <a href="#!-- #ID:r19s20B --#">20</a>(B)</span> provides that the extent of discipline to be imposed is 
subject to review. In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that 
disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, 
protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future 
misconduct. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The 
discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness 
of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 
1984)</span>.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent has admitted to numerous instances of serious professional 
misconduct, including neglect of legal matters, failure to communicate with 
clients, failure to account for or return unearned legal fees, failure to 
properly safeguard client and third party funds, and failure to cooperate with 
the ODC in its investigation. The baseline sanction for respondent’s conduct in 
these matters is disbarment. See <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Hinrichs</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:486%20So.2d%20116 --#">486 So. 
2d 116</a>, 122 (La. 1986)</span>. After reviewing the record, in particular the lengthy 
list of aggravating factors the board determined to be present in this case, we 
see no reason to deviate from the baseline sanction. Accordingly, we will accept 
the petition for consent discipline and order that respondent be disbarred from 
the practice of law.</p>

<p align="center"><b>DECREE</b></p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and 
considering the record filed herein, it is ordered that the name of Roxanne D. 
Andrus be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that her license to practice 
law in the State of Louisiana be revoked. Respondent is ordered to make 
restitution to her clients and to injured third parties. All costs and expenses 
in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court 
Rule XIX, § <a href="#!-- #ID:r19s10.1 --#">10.1</a>, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of 
finality of this court’s judgment until paid.<br>
