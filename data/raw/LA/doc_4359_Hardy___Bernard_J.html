  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class='signature'>PER CURIAM<a href="#fn_">*</a></p>

  <p class='Bodycopy'>This disciplinary matter arises from a petition for consent discipline jointly filed by
  respondent.  Bernard J. Hardy, and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") following the institution of formal
  charges.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <h3>CountI</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> In Count I of the formal charges, the ODC alleges that in May 1995, Leo Sanford retained
  respondent to handle a succession matter.  Mr. Sanford paid respondent's student worker $120 for legal research, and
  paid respondent a total of $500 for legal services.  After the initial research, respondent allegedly failed to
  complete the representation.  Respondent failed to return telephone calls front Mr. Sanford and later relocated his
  office without notice to Mr. Sanford.  Respondent also failed to account for the fee to his client or to return any
  unearned portion of the fee.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> The ODC alleges, and respondent admits, that these actions violated Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (failure to act with diligence). <span class="Rules">1.4</span> (failure to
  communicate with a client), <span class="Rules">1.5(f)(6)</span> (failure to refund an unearned fee),
  <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct) of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count II</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy"><b> </b>In Count II of the formal charges, the ODC alleges that on September 15, 1997, respondent
  promised he would complete the Sanford matter and report the results to the ODC within forty-five days; however, he
  failed to do so. On January 26, 1998, the ODC requested that respondent submit additional information and
  documentation of his efforts to complete the matter.  Respondent failed to do so.  On April 21, 1998, an
  investigatory subpoena was issued to compel respondent's appearance and sworn statement before the ODC.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges, and respondent admits, that these actions violated Rules
  <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct), <a href="#fn1" name="fnref1"
  id="fnref1">(FN1)</a> and moved to recall the deemed admitted order.  The motion to recall was granted and a formal
  hearing was set.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Prior to the formal hearing, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent
  discipline.  The parties proposed that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six months, deferred,
  subject to eighteen months of supervised probation with a practice monitor and the completion of an additional five
  hours of continuing legal education in the area of law office management.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/1999-10-18_98-DB-075.htm">Disciplinary  Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board recognized respondent has admitted that he engaged in the misconduct set
  forth in the formal charges.  The board found that respondent violated duties owed to his client and has engaged in
  negligent misconduct.  The board suggested that respondent's misconduct is mitigated by the absence of a prior
  disciplinary record, the absence of a selfish or dishonest motive, restitution of unearned fees, and remorse;
  however, it noted substantial experience</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, the board recommended respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six
  months, deferred, subject to an eighteen-month period of supervised probation with a practice monitor and the
  completion of an additional five hours of continuing legal education in law office management.  The board further
  reconunended that respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to
  commence thirtv davs from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the recommendation of the
  disciplinary board.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> Respondent has admitted that he engaged in the misconduct set forth in the formal charees. 
  Based on our review of the record, we find the proposed consent discipline is appropriate under the
  circumstances.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> Accordingly, we will accept  the petition for consent discipline.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the
  record filed herein, it is ordered that Bernard J. Hardy be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six
  months, deferred, subject to an eighteen-month period of supervised probation with a practice monitor and the
  completion of an additional five hours of continuing legal education in the area of law office management.  All costs
  and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with
  legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class='footnote'><a name="fn_" href="#fnref_" id="fn_">*</a>Knoll, J., not on panel.  Rule TV, Part 11, § 3.</p>

  <p class='footnote'><a name="fn1" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a>. Respondent filed a lengthy and detailed response to
  the formal charges, in which he explained that he and Mr. Sanford met on several occasions to discuss a complicated
  succession matter.  The character of the representation apparently changed upon each meeting; however, Mr. Sanford
  was never able to supply respondent with the basic information necessary to complete the matter, including the
  decedent's will. in the practice of law (admitted 1982) and obstruction of the disciplinary process as aggravating
  factors.  The board also recognized that respondent's client did not suffer any actual harm.</p>
