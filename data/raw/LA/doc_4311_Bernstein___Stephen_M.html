<p><font size="3"><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since no formal hearing was conducted, the underlying facts were not developed in detail.&nbsp; However, the petition indicates respondent was engaged in an ongoing practice of using various persons to whom the payment of money or anything of value was made for the purpose of obtaining representation of clients.&nbsp; The parties agree that respondent</font><font face='Courier New' size="2">?</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">s conduct violated </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE7.2'></a><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</font><span class="CITE"><font face='Times New Roman' size="1">1</font></span><p>
<p><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prior to the filing of formal charges, respondent filed a </font>petition for consent discipline.<font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; Respondent admitted his conduct violated the Rules of Professional Conduct.&nbsp; As discipline, respondent sought a three year suspension, with one year deferred, followed by a two year period of probation subject to conditions.&nbsp; Respondent agreed to cooperate with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) and provide complete and truthful testimony in any disciplinary proceeding, as well as in any state criminal prosecution against any person&nbsp; alleged to have accepted anything of value in exchange for obtaining representation of clients, or in such proceedings against other lawyers participating as a principal or accessory in such conduct.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ODC filed a concurrence in the petition, praying that the petition be approved and the stipulated form of discipline be imposed.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The matter was submitted to the disciplinary board.&nbsp; After considering the matter, the board found the proposed consent discipline was appropriate, and recommended that it be adopted.&nbsp; One member of the board dissented, on the ground that the record contained insufficient information regarding respondent's conduct.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither respondent nor the ODC filed objections in this court to the recommendation of the disciplinary board.</font></p>
