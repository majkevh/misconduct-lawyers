  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-1189</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: JOHN JOSEPH ARBOUR</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p>PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, John Joseph Arbour, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana, but currently
  ineligible to practice.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the latter part of 1999, Lydia Tamburello ("Lydia"), an elderly friend of respondent's family,
  hired respondent to handle the succession of her brother, Salvador Tamburello ("Salvador"). Respondent did not have a
  fee agreement with his client.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On September 29, 1999, respondent filed a petition for probate on behalf of Lydia in Succession
  of Salvador S. Tamburello, No. 99-15651 on the docket of the Orleans Parish Civil District Court. Lydia was appointed
  executrix by court order dated October 4, 1999. Thereafter, respondent handled the liquidation of Salvador's assets,
  which included bonds and several pieces of property. However, he allowed one of the succession properties to be sold
  at a sheriff's sale because $553.52 in taxes were not paid in 2001. Without court approval, respondent made a partial
  distribution of succession assets and paid succession debts. A $50,000 check issued to August Tamburello, Jr.
  ("August") was returned due to insufficient funds in the succession account. Respondent also issued a succession
  check payable to the Internal Revenue Service in the amount of $5,000 on April 17, 2000. He issued another succession
  check payable to the Internal Revenue Service in the amount of $150,000 on June 20, 2000. Finally, respondent issued
  a succession check payable to the Louisiana Department of Revenue in the amount of $60,000 on June 20, 2000. He did
  not prepare or file tax returns in support of these payments. He also took $40,000 in attorney's fees between March
  and September 2000 without court approval.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Salvador was survived by his wife, Rosine Gallo Tamburello ("Rosine"), an interdict, who was
  represented in the succession proceedings by Richard Verlander. On March 20, 2000, Mr. Verlander submitted a
  community property claim on behalf of Rosine, to which respondent failed to respond. He also failed to respond to Mr.
  Verlander's repeated requests for a descriptive list and accounting of assets. In a further attempt to obtain
  respondent's cooperation, Mr. Verlander filed three pleadings into the succession proceeding on behalf of Rosine.
  These matters were set for hearing on December 1, 2000. Respondent indicated he would cooperate with Mr. Verlander,
  and the hearing was continued without date. However, respondent failed to cooperate, and the hearing was reset for
  January 26, 2001. At the hearing, respondent was ordered to provide responses to all previous discovery requests and
  submit a judgment of possession as to Rosine's interests by February 15, 2001. Respondent failed to comply with the
  order, and eventually an attachment was issued for him. On April 18, 2001, the court ordered respondent to submit a
  judgment of possession and accounting as to Rosine's interests within thirty days. Respondent failed to comply with
  the order but tendered checks totaling $600,000 to settle Rosine's claim against the succession without consulting
  Lydia or obtaining the court's approval. Consequently, Mr. Verlander filed a notice of probable overpayment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In November 2001, Jacqueline Mae Goldberg enrolled as counsel for the executor of Salvador's
  estate, and respondent's representation was terminated. That same day, August replaced Lydia as executor. Thereafter,
  Ms. Goldberg requested financial records and information from respondent concerning succession transactions.
  Respondent failed to supply the requested information. The issue was addressed in a February 1, 2002 hearing on a
  rule to show cause, which respondent failed to attend. At that time, judgment was rendered ordering respondent to
  produce the requested information within five days of being served with notice. Respondent failed to comply with the
  court order.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">August filed a disciplinary complaint against respondent on November 13, 2002, and Ms. Goldberg
  provided follow-up information to the ODC.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a> Respondent failed
  to respond to two notices of the complaint, necessitating the issuance of a subpoena to obtain his sworn statement.
  During the April 20, 2003 sworn statement, respondent indicated, among other things, that he was no longer practicing
  law and was now working as an accountant.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On September 3, 2003, Ms. Goldberg filed a petition for accounting in a proceeding captioned
  Succession of Salvador S. Tamburello v. John J. Arbour, No. 598-661 on the docket of the 24th Judicial District Court
  for the Parish of Jefferson. On January 24, 2004, respondent entered into a settlement agreement wherein he signed a
  $30,000 promissory note payable to the Succession of Salvador Tamburello due within thirty days and agreed to pay
  court costs in the amount of $250. After receiving notice on February 26, 2004 that he was in default of the
  promissory note, respondent delivered two checks for the full amount of the settlement to Ms. Goldberg the following
  day. Thereafter, Ms. Goldberg requested that the court dismiss the petition for accounting.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Finally, respondent was ineligible to practice law from September 1, 2000 to December 29, 2000
  for failing to pay his bar dues and the disciplinary assessment. Respondent has also been ineligible to practice law
  since July 26, 2001 for failing to comply with mandatory continuing legal education requirements. These periods of
  ineligibility coincide with his handling of the succession matter.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On February 2, 2004, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent, alleging that
  his conduct violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.1</span>
  (failure to provide competent representation to a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with
  reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to
  communicate with a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.5(a)</span>(b)(f) (fee arrangements), <span class=
  "allegedrules">1.14(a)</span> (client under a disability), <span class="allegedrules">1.15</span> (safekeeping
  property of clients or third persons), <span class="allegedrules">1.16(a)</span>(d) (declining or terminating
  representation), <span class="allegedrules">3.2</span> (failure to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation),
  <span class="allegedrules">3.4(a)</span> (obstructing another party's access to evidence), <span class=
  "allegedrules">3.4(c)</span> (knowing disobedience of an obligation under the rules of a tribunal), <span class=
  "allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation), <span class=
  "allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct), <span class=
  "allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges served upon him by certified
  mail on February 6, 2004. Accordingly, the factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by
  clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). No formal hearing was held, but the
  parties were given an opportunity to file with the hearing committee written arguments and documentary evidence on
  the issue of sanctions. Respondent filed nothing for the hearing committee's consideration.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-09-13_04-DB-001.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After considering the ODC's submission in response to the deemed admitted order, the hearing
  committee found that respondent issued succession checks without court approval or supporting documentation,
  including taking a $40,000 fee without a fee arrangement. Respondent also failed to provide a suitable accounting and
  failed to comply with various court orders. When Ms. Goldberg replaced respondent, he failed to turn over succession
  financial records and information concerning succession transactions despite both formal and informal requests.
  Finally, the committee found that respondent has been ineligible to practice law since July 26, 2001 and practiced
  law without authority to do so during part of his representation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these factual findings, the committee determined that respondent violated Rules 1.1,
  1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 3.2, 3.4, 8.1, and 8.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent knowingly
  violated duties owed to his clients and the legal system. His pattern of failing to respond to both formal and
  informal requests for information and documentation delayed the succession and prompted an elderly executor to
  initiate a civil action to obtain an accounting for the recovery of assets. Suspension is the baseline sanction
  according to the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee found that the following aggravating factors are present: bad faith obstruction of
  the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency,
  refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, vulnerability of the victim, and indifference to making
  restitution. Absence of a prior disciplinary record was the sole mitigating factor found by the committee.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances and considering prior jurisprudence, the committee recommended that
  respondent be suspended from the practice of law for two years.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2005-04-26_04-DB-001.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing this matter, the disciplinary board found that the factual allegations contained
  in the formal charges were proven by clear and convincing evidence. Based on the proven facts, the board determined
  that respondent violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.1</span>, <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class=
  "Rules">1.4</span>, <span class="Rules">1.5(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.5(b)</span>, <span class=
  "Rules">1.5(f)(6)</span> (failure to refund an unearned fee), <span class="Rules">1.14(a)</span>, <span class=
  "Rules">1.15(b)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.16(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span>, <span class=
  "Rules">3.2</span>, <span class="Rules">3.4(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">3.4(c)</span>, <span class=
  "Rules">8.1(c)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span>, <span class=
  "Rules">8.4(d)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board also determined that respondent knowingly, if not intentionally, violated duties owed
  to his clients, the legal system, and as a professional. His conduct caused serious actual harm to his client. His
  failure to cooperate harmed the profession, and his failure to provide competent and reasonably timely services
  harmed the legal system. The board adopted the aggravating and mitigating factors found by the hearing committee and
  determined that the baseline sanction is suspension under the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions. The
  board also determined that prior jurisprudence supports a lengthy suspension.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice
  of law for two years. The board also recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these
  proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters fall within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316
  (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In cases in which the lawyer does not answer the formal charges, the factual allegations of those
  charges are deemed admitted. Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). Thus, the ODC bears no additional burden to prove
  the factual allegations contained in the formal charges after those charges have been deemed admitted. However, the
  language of § 11(E)(3) does not encompass legal conclusions that flow from the factual allegations. If the legal
  conclusion the ODC seeks to prove (i.e., a violation of a specific rule) is not readily apparent from the deemed
  admitted facts, additional evidence may need to be submitted in order to prove the legal conclusions that flow from
  the admitted factual allegations. <span class="cite">In re: Donnan, 01-3058 (La. 1/10/03), <a href=
  "2003-01-10_2001-3058.htm">838 So. 2d 715</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the deemed admitted facts and other evidence in the record, we find respondent violated
  the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged. Respondent neglected a succession matter, charged an excessive fee
  without court approval then failed to promptly refund the unearned portion, issued checks from the succession account
  without court approval or supporting documentation, issued an NSF check from the succession account, failed to
  provide an accounting and information to other attorneys involved in the matter, disobeyed court orders, failed to
  cooperate with the ODC, and practiced law while ineligible.<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a>
  Having found this professional misconduct, the sole issue presented for our consideration is the appropriate
  sanction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain
  high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct.
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La.
  1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses
  involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's misconduct caused actual harm to his client and third persons, as well as undue
  delay in the succession and disciplinary proceedings. The baseline sanction for such misconduct is a suspension from
  the practice of law.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Several aggravating factors are present, including <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith
  obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the
  disciplinary agency</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the
  conduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the victim</span>, and <span class=
  "ABAstandard">indifference to making restitution</span>. The sole mitigating factor is respondent's <span class=
  "ABAstandard">lack of a prior disciplinary record</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the facts of this case in light of the aggravating and mitigating factors, we find
  the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct is a two-year suspension from the practice of law.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that John Joseph Arbour, Louisiana Bar Roll number 22233, be and he hereby
  is suspended from the practice of law for a period of two years. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed
  against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days
  from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> In his complaint, August indicated
  that he is "disadvantaged with macular degeneration" and must have someone read and write for him. His main complaint
  was the $50,000 NSF check. In a January 30, 2004 letter, Ms. Goldberg informed the ODC of the following:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">From what I understand, Mr. John Arbor [sic] had total control of the succession account.
    All Ms. Lydia Tamburello did was sign several checks in blank which remained under Mr. Arbor's [sic] custody and
    control.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">From what I am led to believe by Mr. August Tamburello, his sister, Lydia, was aged and
    infirmed and had no idea of what was going on. She depended and relied upon Mr. Arbor [sic] for the administration
    of all matters.</p>
