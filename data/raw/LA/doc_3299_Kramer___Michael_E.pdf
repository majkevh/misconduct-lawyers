  <p class="headingstyle">No. 93-DB-054</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: MICHAEL E. KRAMER</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Disciplinary Board has thoroughly reviewed Hearing Committee No. 4's well written <a href="../HC/1995-08-23_93-DB-054.htm">report</a> and
  finds that there is no manifest error in the hearing committee's findings of facts.  Therefore, the Board accepts
  those findings.  The respondent engaged in conduct which constituted conflicts of interest and failed to maintain the
  public trust.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Nevertheless, there are numerous mitigating circumstances including those outlined in the hearing
  committee report, the length of time since the violations, respondent's reputation and service to the community, the
  absence of prior disciplinary record, and his full disclosure and cooperation with the disciplinary process.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly the Board recommends that respondent Michael Kramer receive a public reprimand with
  the following conditions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1 . 'The respondent should be required to complete 10 hours of continuing legal education
    directed specifically to the subject of ethics.  These hours should be in addition to the CLE hours required by the
    Louisiana State Bar Association <u>and</u> should be obtained by the respondent within two years from the finality
    of the Court's decision in these proceedings.  Proof of compliance should be submitted directly to the Office of
    the Disciplinary Counsel.</p>

    <p class="inverted">2. The respondent should refrain from engaging in any other acts of misconduct which are in
    violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

    <p class="inverted">3. The respondent should be responsible for all the costs associated with these proceedings in
    the amount to be determined by the Board Administrator.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">I dissent from the majority recommendation of the Disciplinary Board. Judge Kramer clearly
    violated the public trust encumbent upon him. in his position and the proposed is insufficient. From the
    allegations before the Board, it appears that a suspension is appropriate, and therefore I cannot approve a mere
    reprimand.</p>
