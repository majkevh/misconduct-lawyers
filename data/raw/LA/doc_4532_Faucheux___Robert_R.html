<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 02-B-0054</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: ROBERT R. FAUCHEUX, JR.</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<h2>PER CURIAM</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary proceeding arises from three counts of formal charges filed 
by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Robert E. 
Faucheux, Jr., an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana.
</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<h3>Counts I &amp; II (The Washington Matters)</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In December 1991, Harold and Mona Washington retained respondent to represent 
them in connection with a vehicular accident involving Mrs. Washington. 
Respondent filed suit on behalf of his clients for personal injury and property 
damage against several defendants, including the Washingtons’ liability and 
collision insurance carrier, Liberty Lloyds Insurance Company (“Liberty 
Lloyds”). Particularly, respondent had alleged loss of consortium on behalf of 
Mr. Washington. During the course of the litigation, the Washingtons began 
experiencing marital difficulties. Mr. Washington retained other counsel to file 
a petition for divorce on his behalf. Mrs. Washington asked respondent to 
represent her in the domestic matter. Respondent referred Mrs. Washington to 
another lawyer employed in his law firm, Marie Joiner Avon. However, when Ms. 
Avon was unable to appear at a hearing in the domestic proceeding, respondent 
appeared on her behalf.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, Ms. Avon moved out of town and respondent referred Mrs. 
Washington’s domestic representation to Avinell Faucheux, another attorney 
employed in his office.<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Meanwhile, respondent continued to represent the Washingtons in the 
automobile accident litigation. On the day the case was set to go to trial, the 
parties agreed to a lump sum settlement of Mrs. Washington’s personal injury 
damages in the amount of $64,000. This settlement did not include any award for 
Mr. Washington’s loss of consortium claim, which respondent had not pursued.<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a>
</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As to the property damage claim, the Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association 
(“LIGA”), as receiver of Liberty Lloyds, the Washington’s insurance carrier, 
paid $6,650 representing the fair market value of the vehicle less the 
deductible. This amount was insufficient to satisfy a money judgment in the 
amount of $12,582.32 which the lien holder, General Motors Acceptance Company 
(“GMAC”) had obtained against Mr. Washington.<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon receiving the settlement funds, respondent notarized blank settlement 
documents and instructed his non-attorney employee to prepare the settlement 
statement and obtain the signatures of Mr. and Mrs. Washington on the documents 
during his absence. Although the employee prepared the settlement statements as 
instructed; however, unbeknown to respondent, the employee forged Mr. 
Washington’s name on the documents.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Following the settlement disbursement, Mrs. Washington raised questions as to 
whether respondent properly disbursed all the funds to which she was entitled to 
receive from the settlement. Upon reviewing the matter, respondent conceded 
there may have been some errors in the calculation of the disbursement. However, 
he asserted any errors in this regard were offset because certain expenses, 
which should have been deducted from Mrs. Washington’s share of the settlement, 
had not been deducted.<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> Dissatisfied with this explanation, Mrs. Washington 
filed a complaint with the ODC.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Washington filed a separate complaint with the ODC. This complaint 
primarily alleged respondent failed to properly protect his interests in 
connection with the GMAC lien, resulting in garnishment of his wages. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After the filing of the complaint, respondent wrote a check to GMAC in the 
amount of $1,903.05, representing the balance of the judgment obtained by GMAC 
against Mr. Washington. Respondent also wrote a check to Mr. Washington in the 
amount of $4,931.89 for the total amount garnished from Mr. Washington’s wages. 
Following these payments, Mr. Washington asked that his complaint be withdrawn, 
but the ODC continued to pursue it.<a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> </p>
<h3>Count III (Scott Matter)</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In April 1995, Catherine Brown Scott retained respondent to represent her 
concerning a slip and fall accident which occurred in Texas. At that time, 
respondent advised his client that he was not licensed to practice law in Texas, 
but that he would try to handle the matter out of court. Thereafter, respondent 
continued to engage in settlement negotiations with the alleged tort feasor’s 
insurance adjuster. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Believing the prescriptive date was approaching<a class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a> and his client was still 
without Texas counsel, respondent drafted a petition for personal injuries and 
damages on behalf of Ms. Scott, which she could file on a pro se basis in the 
Texas state court. Ms. Scott signed the petition in proper person; however, 
respondent also signed the petition to ensure defendant’s counsel would continue 
to negotiate a settlement with him. The defendant filed its answer with the 
court and directed a copy to respondent, not Ms. Scott. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The suit was subsequently removed to the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of Texas. Shortly thereafter, defendant’s counsel learned for 
the first time that respondent was not licensed to practice law in Texas. The 
defendant’s counsel filed a motion to disqualify respondent, and also requested 
sanctions be imposed on respondent for the unauthorized practice of law. 
Respondent concurred in the disqualification and filed a motion to withdraw as 
counsel. As a result, the federal court denied the motion to disqualify as moot, 
but awarded sanctions in the amount of $1,000 against respondent. Subsequently, 
the federal court brought the matter to the attention of the ODC. </p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges Formal Charges </h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC instituted formal charges against respondent. As 
to the Washington matter, the charges alleged violations of Rules 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.2 --#">1.2</a></span> 
(incompetence), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.3 --#">1.3</a></span> (neglect of a legal matter), 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.4 --#">1.4</a></span> (failure to communicate 
with client so as to allow client’s participation), <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.7 --#">1.7</a></span> (engaging in prohibited 
transaction resulting in conflict of interest), <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.8 --#">1.8</a>(g)</span> (improperly aggregating 
two clients’ settlements), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.15 --#">1.15</a>(c)</span> (failure to keep client property separate 
until dispute resolved), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.16 --#">1.16</a></span>(d) (failure to protect client interests at 
termination of representation), <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE5.3 --#">5.3</a></span>(b) (failure to supervise a non-lawyer 
employee) and <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(a)</span> (professional misconduct) of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct, as well as <span class="Rules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s28 --#">28</a></span> (failure to maintain trust 
account). With regard to the Scott matter, the ODC alleged violations of Rules 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE3.4 --#">3.4</a>(c)</span> (knowingly disobey tribunal orders), 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE5.5 --#">5.5</a>(a)</span> (engaging in the unauthorized 
practice of law), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.3 --#">8.3</a>(a)</span> (failure to report professional misconduct), 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(a)</span> 
(professional misconduct) and <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the 
administration of justice), as well as Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 
<span class="Rules">9(a)</span> and (b) 
(violating rules of professional conduct of another jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In response to each of the counts of misconduct, respondent filed a general 
denial of the allegations. Accordingly, the matter was scheduled for formal 
hearing.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:97-DB-050.HC --#">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Following the formal hearing, the hearing committee rendered its written 
findings and recommendation concluding there was only clear and convincing 
evidence to support Count I of the formal charges relating to Mr. Washington’s 
complaint. Specifically, it found respondent violated Rule 1.4 by failing to 
properly communicate with Mr. Washington and keep him reasonably informed 
regarding the matter. Moreover, the committee determined respondent violated the 
conflict of interest provisions of Rule 1.7(a) by directing an attorney employed 
by him (Ms. Faucheux) to represent Mrs. Washington in the divorce proceeding, 
while respondent continued to represent Mr. Washington in the personal injury 
litigation. The committee found that, under these circumstances, respondent 
should have advised Mr. Washington of the potential for a conflict of interest 
and obtained a waiver from him. The committee also concluded respondent violated 
Rule 1.8(g) (improperly aggregating two clients’ settlements) by entering into 
an aggregate settlement of Mr. and Mrs. Washington’s claims without prior 
consultation with, and consent of, Mr. Washington.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The committee also found respondent violated Rule 5.3(b) by failing to 
supervise his non-lawyer employee, which resulted in the forgery of Mr. 
Washington’s signature on the settlement documents. Although it recognized 
respondent neither participated in, nor knew of the forgery, it concluded he 
violated Rule 8.4 (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of 
justice) by notarizing the settlement documents in blank. The committee also 
found respondent violated this provision by seeking to have Mr. Washington 
dismiss his complaint as a condition of restitution.<a class="fn" href="#fn7">7</a> </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">With regard to Mrs. Washington’s complaint, the committee found the ODC 
failed to prove the allegations by clear and convincing evidence. Specifically, 
the committee determined there was insufficient evidence to support the 
allegations that all expenses deducted from Mrs. Washington’s settlement 
proceeds were not paid to the appropriate parties.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As to Count III, the committee also concluded there was insufficient evidence 
that respondent had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. It recognized 
that the petition for damages filed in the Texas court was contemplated and 
prepared as a pro se complaint by Ms. Scott. While it determined it was 
“unorthodox (and risky)” for respondent to affix his signature on the complaint 
just to assure his participation in the settlement negotiations, it found 
respondent’s assistance to Ms. Scott in pursuing her pro se complaint was 
“(understandably) misinterpreted.” </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In addressing the issue of sanctions, the committee found respondent’s 
actions were negligent. While there was no direct pecuniary harm to those 
involved, Mr. Washington’s confidence was shaken and he was confused about his 
rights and the process, thus, resulting in harm to the disciplinary system. The 
committee determined the baseline sanction for this conduct was suspension.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The sole aggravating factor recognized by the committee was respondent’s 
substantial experience in the practice of law.<a class="fn" href="#fn8">8</a> In mitigation, it recognized 
respondent’s absence of a prior disciplinary record, absence of a dishonest or 
selfish motive, personal or emotional problems,<a class="fn" href="#fn9">9</a> timely good faith effort to 
make restitution or to rectify the consequences of his misconduct, full and free 
disclosure and cooperative attitude toward the proceedings and remorse.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering these factors, the committee recommended respondent be suspended 
from the practice of law for a period of two years, deferred in full, subject to 
a two year period of probation with numerous conditions.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:97-DB-050.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board accepted the committee’s findings of fact, with the 
exception of the finding that respondent’s actions were negligent. Instead, the 
board found respondent’s conduct was, at the very least, knowing. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As to the issue of sanctions, the board determined respondent violated duties 
owed to his clients, to the legal system and the profession. The board expressed 
concern over respondent’s “cavalier” attitude towards his client, Mr. 
Washington, and the fact that he did not vigorously protect Mr. Washington’s 
interests. Like the committee, it found that Mr. Washington’s confidence was 
shaken and he was confused about his rights and involvement in the process, 
resulting in harm to the disciplinary system. Moreover, while it found there was 
no actual harm to his client, there was great potential for such harm. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The board adopted the aggravating and mitigating factors cited by the 
committee. As a sanction, it recommended respondent be suspended for a period of 
one year, with six months deferred, followed by a one year period of probation 
with specified conditions. One board member filed a dissent without assigning 
reasons.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an objection to the board’s recommendation. Accordingly, the 
matter was docketed for oral argument pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 
11(G)(1)(b). </p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. 
La. Const. art. V, §5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an 
independent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has 
been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="CITE">In re: Quaid, 94-1316 (La. 
11/30/94), <a href="#!-- #ID:646%20So.2d%20343 --#">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 348</span>; 
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Boutall</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:597%20So.2d%20444 --#">597 So. 2d 
444</a>, 445 (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in any way by the findings and 
recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held 
the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee’s factual findings. 
<span class="CITE">See <i>In re: Caulfield</i>, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:683%20So.2d%20714 --#">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; 
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 
93-2865 (La. 3/11/94), <a href="#!-- #ID:633%20So.2d%20150 --#">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record supports the hearing committee’s findings that the ODC proved by 
clear and convincing evidence that respondent failed to communicate with Mr. 
Washington. It is undisputed that respondent did not keep Mr. Washington 
informed about the status of his case and, as a result, Mr. Washington was 
confused about the proceeding. While Mr. Washington’s loss of consortium claim 
may have been of questionable value in light of his divorce from Mrs. 
Washington, the fact remains that respondent had a professional obligation to 
communicate with Mr. Washington and provide him sufficient information to make 
informed decisions regarding the litigation.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">We also find the ODC proved by clear and convincing evidence that respondent 
created a conflict of interest when he directed an attorney with which he was 
associated to represent Mrs. Washington in the domestic proceeding while he 
continued to represent Mr. Washington in the automobile accident case. Rule 
1.7(a) provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that 
client will be directly adverse to another client, unless:</p>
<p>(1) The lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not adversely 
affect the relationship with the other client; and</p>
<p>(2) Each client consents after consultation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Bodycopy">Clearly, the interests of Mr. and Mrs. Washington became directly adverse 
upon the filing of the divorce petition. Under these circumstances, respondent 
could not reasonably believe that representation of Mrs. Washington in the 
domestic case would not adversely affect his representation of Mr. Washington in 
the personal injury litigation case.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent apparently recognized that it would be a clear conflict for him to 
represent Mrs. Washington in the domestic litigation under these circumstances, 
and sought to eliminate the conflict by referring Mrs. Washington’s domestic 
case to his associate attorney, Ms. Faucheux. However, Rule 1.10(a) specifically 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly 
represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited 
from doing so by Rules 1.7, 1.8(c), 1.9, or 2.2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Bodycopy">Therefore, the only way for respondent to continue the dual representation 
would be for him to have obtained a waiver of conflict from both Mr. and Mrs. 
Washington. It is undisputed that respondent failed to do so.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Similarly, respondent violated Rule 1.8(g) when he participated in an 
aggregate settlement of the Washingtons’ automobile accident case without 
obtaining their consent to the aggregate settlement after appropriate 
consultation. As noted previously, Mr. Washington’s consortium claim probably 
had little value, but respondent had a professional obligation to provide full 
information to Mr. Washington prior to advising him to enter into the 
settlement.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">We also find the ODC produced clear and convincing evidence that respondent 
violated Rules 5.3 and 8.4 by failing to supervise his non-lawyer employee, 
resulting in the forgery of Mr. Washington’s name on the settlement documents. 
While it is undisputed that respondent was not aware of the forgery, Rule 5.3 
mandates that the lawyer make reasonable efforts to ensure that the non-lawyer 
employee’s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the 
lawyer. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Cline</i>, 99-2779 (La. 2/29/00), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:756%20So.2d%20284 --#">756 So. 2d 284</a></span>. Respondent made no 
reasonable efforts to ensure proper conduct on the part of his non-lawyer 
employee; indeed, by notarizing the settlements in blank, he created the 
potential for mischief.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As to the remaining counts, we see no error in the committee’s conclusion 
that the ODC failed to prove these allegations by clear and convincing evidence. 
We believe the allegations of unauthorized practice of law present a very close 
case, especially in light of the sanctions imposed by the Texas court. However, 
because this issue is inherently factual, we decline to find the committee was 
clearly wrong when it concluded the ODC did not prove the allegations of the 
unauthorized practice of law.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional violations, we now turn to the appropriate sanction 
for respondent’s misconduct. The purpose of disciplinary proceedings is not 
primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to maintain the appropriate standards 
of professional conduct, to preserve the integrity of the legal profession and 
to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the standards of the 
profession. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Vaughan</i>, 00-1892 (La. 10/27/00), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:772%20So.2d%2087 --#">772 So. 2d 87</a></span>; 
<span class="CITE">In re: Lain, 
00-0148 (La. 5/26/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:760%20So.2d%201152 --#">760 So. 2d 1152</a></span>; 
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Levy</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:400%20So.2d%201355 --#">400 
So. 2d 1355</a> (La. 1981)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of 
each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of 
any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Redd</i>, 95-1472 (La. 
9/15/95), <a href="#!-- #ID:660%20So.2d%20839 --#">660 So. 2d 839</a></span>;

520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">While respondent’s misconduct did not cause any actual injury to his clients, 
there was a potential for injury. Under these circumstances, Standard 7.2 of the 
ABA’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions sets a baseline sanction of 
suspension.<a class="fn" href="#fn10">10</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As mitigating factors, we recognize respondent’s absence of a prior 
disciplinary record, absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, personal or 
emotional problems, timely good faith effort to make restitution or to rectify 
the consequences of his misconduct, full and free disclosure and cooperative 
attitude toward the proceedings and remorse. The sole aggravating factor 
apparent from the record is respondent’s substantial experience in the practice 
of law.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering all the facts, we find a six-month suspension from the practice 
of law is the appropriate sanction. In light of the mitigating factors, we will 
defer this suspension in its entirety, and place respondent on supervised 
probation for a period of one year, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A practice monitor shall be appointed by the ODC to supervise respondent’s 
law office practice;</li>
  <li>With the practice monitor’s assistance, respondent shall develop and 
implement law office policies and/or practice guidelines for himself and his 
office staff;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Respondent shall submit evidence to the ODC indicating the $1,000 sanction 
imposed by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas 
has been satisfied; </li>
  <li>During the period of probation, respondent shall complete six hours of 
continuing legal education in the area of law office management, in addition to 
his regular mandatory continuing legal education requirements; and</li>
  <li>In the event respondent fails to comply with these conditions or engages 
in any misconduct during the period of probation, the deferred period of the 
suspension shall become executory upon motion to this court by the ODC.</li>
</ol>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">For the reasons assigned, it is ordered that Robert R. Faucheux, Jr. be 
suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months. It is further 
ordered the suspension be fully deferred and that respondent be placed on 
supervised probation for a period of one year, subject to the conditions set 
forth in this opinion. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against 
respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal 
interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s 
judgment until paid.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<hr noshade="" color="#000000" align="left" width="100" size="1">
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> Ms. Faucheux is not related to respondent.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> Based on respondent’s failure to pursue this claim, the 
opposing counsel had previously filed a motion to strike any damages for loss of 
consortium requested by Mr. Washington, which the trial court granted. 
Respondent later testified he believed Mr. Washington’s claim for loss of 
consortium had little value in light of the Washingtons’ subsequent divorce. As 
a result, he did not pursue the claim. </p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> GMAC had instituted garnishment proceedings against Mr. 
Washington to satisfy the money judgment it had previously obtained against him. 
Respondent had mistakenly believed that GMAC would accept the $6,085.97 paid by 
the insurer in full satisfaction of this claim.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> Specifically, respondent contended that he paid $7,839.62 
in expenses during the litigation but had failed to recover this amount from the 
Washingtons.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">5</a> Respondent informed the ODC that he was aware that Mr. 
Washington intended to withdraw the complaint, but specifically denied that he 
advised Mr. Washington to do so.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn6">6</a> Respondent was under the mistaken impression that Texas 
law provided for a one year prescriptive period for instituting a personal 
injury suit.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn7">7</a> The committee noted that it was irrelevant whether the 
request to dismiss the complaint on the basis of restitution was explicit or 
not. It found it was clearly implicit based on the record.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn8">8</a> Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in 1975 
and, thus, practicing for approximately 20 years at the time of the misconduct.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn9">9</a> At the formal hearing, respondent testified and presented 
documentary evidence to support his claims in mitigation that, during the time 
of the misconduct, he was involved in a prolonged child custody and visitation 
dispute with his former wife, as well as suffered from bouts of depression. The 
hearing committee had specifically placed this evidence under seal pursuant to 
the joint motion of respondent and the ODC. At oral argument, we questioned 
whether the parties sustained their burden under Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 16(d) 
to have the evidence placed under seal. At that time, respondent agreed to allow 
the evidence to be made public. </p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn10">10</a> Standard 7.2 provides a “[s]uspension is generally 
appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a 
duty owed to the profession, and causes serious or potentially serious injury to 
a client, the public, or the legal system.”</p>
