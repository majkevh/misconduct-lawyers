  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-0337</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: BRODERICK DeJEAN</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, Broderick DeJean, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana but currently on
  interim suspension.'</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING <b>FACTS</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The underlying facts of this matter are not in dispute, having been stipulated to by the
  parties.</p>

  <h3>Count I</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In August 2000, the Ortego Chiropractic Clinic filed a disciplinary complaint against respondent,
  alleging that he settled claims for two of its patients in June 1998 but failed to remit payment of its medical
  bills. In response to the complaint, respondent admitted this and other misconduct. Specifically, respondent reported
  that he converted approximately $148,000 in client and third-party funds between 1998 and 2001.<a name="fnref2"
  class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a> He settled claims and kept the funds for his own use without the knowledge
  or consent of his clients or the third parties to whom the funds were owed. Additionally, respondent self-reported
  that he neglected the legal matters of three clients, allowing those cases to be abandoned.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Thereafter, respondent stipulated that his conduct in this matter violated Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client),
  <span class="Rules">1.15(a)</span> (safekeeping property of clients or third persons), and
  <span class="Rules">1.15(b)</span> (failure to promptly deliver funds to a client or third person) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count II</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In March 2000, Molly Davis retained respondent to handle a workers' compensation claim. The claim
  was settled in May 2000. In disbursing the settlement funds, respondent withheld $1,500 to repay unearned benefits to
  the workers' compensation insurer. Respondent did not pay the funds to the insurer as promised, nor did he remit the
  $1,500 to his client. In September 2001, the insurer had Ms. Davis arrested and charged with theft of the unearned
  benefits. Three months later, respondent attempted to reimburse Ms. Davis $1,225.99 of the $1,500 he had withheld to
  repay the unearned benefits. Pursuant to her attorney's advice, Ms. Davis did not accept this payment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In September 2002, Ms. Davis, through her attorney, filed a disciplinary complaint against
  respondent, alleging that he mishandled her settlement funds, which resulted in her arrest. Respondent failed to
  respond to the complaint, necessitating the issuance of a subpoena. Respondent failed to appear in response to the
  subpoena. In February 2003, the Louisiana State Bar Association's Client Assistance Fund paid Ms. Davis $1,500 for
  her claim against respondent.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent stipulated that his conduct in this matter violated Rules 1.15(a),
  <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation),
  <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation),
  and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count III</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 1999, Timothy Hale retained respondent to handle a personal injury matter. In August 2000, the
  matter was settled for $10,000. With Mr. Hale's permission, respondent endorsed the settlement check and negotiated
  it. However, respondent failed to disburse any funds to his client or his client's medical provider.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent stipulated that his conduct in this matter violated Rules 1.15(a), 1.15(b), and 8.4(c)
  of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was served with the formal charges and answered with a general denial. As such, the
  hearing committee conducted a formal hearing. During the hearing, respondent verbally stipulated to the above facts
  and rule violations and the ODC introduced documentary evidence in support of the formal charges. Thereafter, a
  second hearing was held for the sole purpose of presenting mitigating evidence. Respondent introduced documentary
  evidence consisting of character letters from his psychologist, doctors, colleagues, and friends in lieu of their
  live testimony. Respondent and his treating physician testified in person before the committee.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-08-04_03-DB-067.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on respondent's stipulations and the documentary evidence presented at the hearings, the
  hearing committee determined that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as stipulated to by the
  parties. The baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is disbarment. The aggravating factors found by the
  committee include respondent's dishonest or selfish motive, a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, and
  substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted 1977). The mitigating factors present are absence of a prior
  disciplinary record, character or reputation, personal and emotional problems, and remorse.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering all the circumstances, the committee recommended that respondent be disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2005-01-24_03-DB-067.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing this matter, the disciplinary board adopted the hearing committee's findings and
  determined that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as stipulated to by the parties. The board
  further found that respondent knowingly, if not intentionally, violated duties owed to his clients and as a
  professional. His misconduct caused serious harm to his clients and third-party medical providers by depriving them
  of their rightful funds for an extended period of time. Furthermore, Ms. Davis went through the ordeal of being
  arrested. Respondent also harmed the profession by failing to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation, unjustly
  causing delays and imposing an additional burden on the disciplinary system.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions,</i> the board determined that
  disbarment is the baseline sanction. The board also adopted the aggravating and mitigating factors found by the
  committee. In determining an appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct, the board looked to prior
  jurisprudence involving similar conversion of client funds and found that this court has often imposed disbarment for
  such misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on this reasoning, the board recommended that respondent be disbarred, retroactive to July
  19, 2002, the date of his interim suspension. The board also recommended that respondent be required to make
  restitution to his victims and be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § <i>5(B).</i> Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine
  whether the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <i><span class="cite">In re:
  Quaid,</span></i> <span class="cite">94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>,
  348</span>; <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass 'n v. Boutall</i>, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597
  So.2d 444</a>, 445 (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the
  hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's
  factual findings. <i>See</i> <span class="cite"><i>In re: Caulfield,</i> 96-1401 (La. <i>11/25/96),</i>
  <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class="cite"><i>In re: Pardue,</i> 93-2865 (La.
  3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the stipulations of fact by the parties and other evidence in the record, we find
  respondent neglected client matters and converted client and third-party funds. Additionally, respondent failed to
  cooperate with the ODC in its investigation and failed to appear in response to a subpoena. The clear and convincing
  evidence in the record establishes that respondent violated Rules 1.3, <i>1.15(a), 1.15(b),</i> 8.1(c), 8.4(c), and
  8.4(g) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional misconduct, we now turn to a discussion of an appropriate sanction. In
  considering that issue, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of
  conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct.
  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass 'n v. Reis</i>, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a>
  (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the
  offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass 'n<br />
   v. Whittington</i>, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's actions, particularly his conversion of a substantial amount of client funds, is
  serious misconduct. He caused actual harm to his clients and third parties. In one instance, respondent's failure to
  remit settlement funds to a third party caused his client to be arrested. His failure to cooperate in the
  investigation of his misconduct needlessly taxed the limited resources of the disciplinary system. The baseline
  sanction for respondent's misconduct is disbarment. See <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v.
  Hinrichs,</i> <a href="1986-03-31_1984-1459.htm">486 So. 2d 116</a> (La. 1986)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As mitigating factors, we recognize the <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary
  record</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">character or reputation</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">personal and
  emotional problems</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>. However, these mitigating factors are
  counterbalanced by significant aggravating factors: <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">a pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>, and
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the record as a whole, we see no reason to deviate from the baseline sanction of
  disbarment. Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board's recommendation and disbar respondent.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Broderick DeJean, Louisiana Bar Roll number 4813, be and he hereby is
  disbarred. His name shall be stricken from the roll of attorneys and his license to practice law in the State of
  Louisiana shall be revoked, retroactive to his July 19, 2002 interim suspension. Respondent is ordered to make
  restitution to his victims and to repay to the Louisiana State Bar Association's Client Assistance Fund any amounts
  paid to claimants on his behalf. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance
  with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this
  court's judgment until paid.</p>
