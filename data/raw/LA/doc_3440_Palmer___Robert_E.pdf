  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE:  ROBERT E. PALMER</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 99-DB-073</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This is a petition for consent discipline.  The Respondent is Robert E. Palmer, of Pontchatoula,
  Louisiana, who has a forty-five year unblemished record as a Louisiana lawyer.    The Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") concurs in the Petition.  For reasons stated below, and in keeping within the constraints of Supreme Court
  Rule XIX, § 20, and <span class="cite"><u>In re Lieberman</u>, <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So.2d
  272</a> (La.1996)</span>, the Disciplinary Board accepts the petition for consent discipline. </p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On August 4, 1999, after an investigation presumably upon a complainant by  Respondent's
  relative, Steve Raacke, the ODC filed formal charges against the Respondent consisting of one count.  The charges
  allege that the Respondent violated Rules of Professional Conduct <span class="allegedrules">1.7</span> and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4d</span><a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" class="fn" id="_ednref1">1</a>, when, in the
  context of a family member's succession, he became "too emotionally involved" which created a "conflict of interest"
  and Respondent "disrupted the removal of movables from the family home" for which he was held in contempt by Judge M.
  Douglas Hughes of the Twenty First Judicial District Court.   </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Respondent, through counsel, filed an answer to the charges on September 24, 1999.  He denied
  any violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  In so doing, he explained there existed a dispute among heirs
  (including himself) to a home and property which had been in the family for about 150 years.  The property passed to
  Respondent's mother and her five siblings in 1961 per a Judgment of Possession.  All of them are now dead.  Three of
  their estates are open.  One was never opened.  Two have been completed.  In the dispute, Respondent represented
  himself and his brother whose interests were adverse to the Raacke's (whose ancestor had never passed title to them
  either by sale, donation, or judgment of possession).  Apparently without standing to do so, the Raacke petitioners
  sought to partition the property, including the sale of certain movables located in the home, some of which were
  owned by Respondent.  However, the Raackes' attorney apparently failed to properly serve and notice all heirs. 
  Respondent obtained a temporary restraining order which prevented the sale and removal of certain movables from the
  property.  The Sheriff's deputies presiding at the public sale refused to honor the temporary restraining order at
  the sale and that is when the altercation occurred between Respondent and Steven Raacke, Respondent's first
  cousin. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On January 14, 2000, the Respondent filed a petition for consent discipline proposing a public
  reprimand and six months probation with conditions.  The ODC concurred that same day.  Along with the petition for
  consent, the Respondent filed a stipulation of facts.  They are:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">I. Respondent was admitted to practice law March 20<sup>th</sup>, 1955;</p>

    <p class="inverted">II. Respondent is an heir in a litigious succession proceeding with family members;</p>

    <p class="inverted">III. During the public sale of movables from the family home, Respondent engaged in a physical
    confrontation with Steven Raacke;</p>

    <p class="inverted">IV. Due to Respondent's actions in the case, he was held in contempt for disregarding orders of
    the court and given a 30 day suspended sentence.  The aforementioned actions were in violation of Rules 1.7 and 8.4
    of the Rules of Professional Conduct, because Respondent was too personally and therefore too emotionally involved
    in the case,</p>

    <p class="inverted">V. In mitigation, Respondent's actions were affected by the personal nature of the litigation
    and he has worked diligently with the other heirs to amicably resolve the underlying conflict or conflicts
    concerning the family home.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">Oral argument before a panel of the Disciplinary Board was held on March 30, 2000.  Deputy
  Disciplinary Counsel Eric K. Barefield appeared on behalf of the ODC.  The Respondent and his counsel, Charles E.
  Tate of Ville Platte, also appeared.</p>

  <h2>THE PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The petition for consent discipline proposes that a public reprimand with six months probation
  (including a monitor) be issued along with the following conditions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">a. Respondent will cooperate with all future investigations by the Office of Disciplinary
    counsel;<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn" id="_ednref2">2</a></p>

    <p class="inverted">b. Respondent shall enroll in and attend one (1) day of Ethics School administered by the
    Louisiana States Bar Association's Practice Assistance and Improvement Committee;<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"
    class="fn" id="_ednref3">3</a></p>

    <p class="inverted">c. Respondent will respond to all reasonable requests of the probation monitor;<a href="#_edn4"
    name="_ednref4" class="fn" id="_ednref4">4</a></p>

    <p class="inverted">d. Should the ODC receive any report or indication of a violation of the terms of the
    probation, a rule to revoke the probation may be filed.  The rule will be heard by the Disciplinary Board pursuant
    to Rule XIX using any procedures that the Board deems appropriate.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1. whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system,
    or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">2. whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">3. the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">4. the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">Here, the Respondent may have violated his duties owed to the legal system and to his client, his
  brother.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" class="fn" id="_ednref5">[i]</a>  His conduct may have been negligent. 
  Injury to the legal system arguably is present because Respondent interfered with the sale/partition order of the
  court.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" class="fn" id="_ednref6">6</a>  No actual or potential injury to his client
  (his bother and himself) is contained in the record or the evidence.  Nor was it explained at oral argument.  No
  aggravating factors are cited by the parties.  In mitigation, the Respondent admits that his actions were affected by
  the personal nature of the litigation; he states that since these events he has worked diligently with the other
  heirs to amicably resolve the underlying conflicts concerning the family home.  The Board accepts this mitigating
  factor and also notes that the mitigating factors of  (a) <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary
  record</span> for 45 years and, (b) <span class="ABAstandard">the imposition of other penalties or sanctions</span>
  (contempt of court) are present.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" class="fn" id="_ednref7">7</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">According to the <i><u>ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</u></i>, Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.33</span> suggests, "reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent in
  determining whether the representation of a client may be materially affected by the lawyer's own interests, or
  whether the representation will adversely affect another client, and causes injury or potential injury to a client." 
  Standard <span class="ABAstandard">6.23</span> suggests, "reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer
  negligently fails to comply with a court order or rule, and causes injury or potential injury to a client or other
  party, or causes interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding."</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As explained earlier, the actual injury to his client resulting from the violation of Rule
  <span class="Rules">1.7</span> is not contained in the evidence or the record.  It is not at all clear how the
  Respondent's own interests could have become adverse to those of his brother, resulting in harm to his brother.  The
  violation of Rule <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> is supported both in the stipulation of facts, as well as the
  response to the formal charges by the Respondent.  The judge presiding in the succession matter held the Respondent
  in contempt for disregarding orders of the court involving the partition of the subject property.  The Respondent
  engaged in a physical confrontation with an opposing heir during the public sale of the movables, leading to the
  contempt ruling. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The proposed public reprimand, with probation conditions, seemingly is the appropriate sanction
  to address the alleged misconduct.  A public reprimand is also arguably in keeping with relavant case law.  For
  example, in <span class="cite"><i><u>In re King</u></i>, <a href="../SC/1992-06-05_1992-0441.htm">601 So.2d 657</a>
  (La. 1992)</span>, the Respondent received a reprimand for violating Rules 8.4(d) and 3.5.  In that case, the
  Respondent undertook representation of his sister and himself in a medical malpractice suit arising out of their
  mother's death.  After a ruling adverse to their interests, the Respondent wrote a discourteous letter to the
  district judge and mailed it to the judge's residence.  This resulted in King's conviction of contempt by the
  district court and the issuance of a reprimand by the Board. Id.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Although not involving a contempt of court charge, the case of in <span class="cite"><i><u>In re
  Estiverne</u></i>, <a href="../SC/1999-09-24_1999-0949.htm">741 So.2d 649</a> (La. 1999)</span>, also offers some
  guidance here.  In that matter, the Court held that writing a discourteous and offensive letter to a worker's
  compensation judge, which attacked the judge's integrity, warranted a public reprimand.  <u>Id.</u> at 653.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Finally, in <span class="cite"><i><u>In re Boellert</u></i>,
  <a href="0000-00-00_93-DB-009.htm">93-DB-009</a></span>, the Board issued a public reprimand to a lawyer when he
  represented one partner against another partner while also representing the partnership, a clear conflict that was
  not disclosed to the court.  He was found to be in violation of several Rules of Professional Conduct, including Rule
  8.4(d). </p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on the above, the Board accepts the petition for consent discipline.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Accordingly, the Board orders that the Respondent, Robert E. Palmer, be issued a public
  reprimand, along with six months probation, together with all costs and expenses  of these proceedings, with the
  following conditions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">a. Respondent will cooperate with all future investigations by the Office of Disciplinary
    counsel;</p>

    <p class="inverted">b. Respondent shall enroll in and attend one (1) day of Ethics School administered by the
    Louisiana States Bar Association's Practice Assistance and Improvement Committee;</p>

    <p class="inverted">c. Respondent will respond to all reasonable requests of the probation monitor;</p>

    <p class="inverted">d. Should the ODC receive any report or indication of a violation of the terms of the
    probation, a rule to revoke the probation may be filed.  The rule will be heard by the Disciplinary Board pursuant
    to Rule XIX using any procedures that the Board deems appropriate.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" class="fn" id="_edn1">1</a> Rule 1.7 states, in pertinent
  part, "Loyalty is an essential element in the lawyer's relationship to a client. Therefore, a lawyer shall not
  represent a client if the representative of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to
  another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer's own interest..."</p>

  <p class="footnotetext">Rule 8.4(d) provides, "It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that
  is prejudicial to the administration of justice."</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref5" name="_edn5" class="fn" id="_edn5">5</a> There is no evidence in the
  record that the Respondent's interest actually was in conflict with or adverse to his brother's interest in the
  succession; thus, there may not have been a conflict of interest as defined by Rule 1.7.  However, according to
  <i><u>In re Lieberman</u>, 675 So.2d 272 (La. 1996),</i> " although the Board may reject proposed consent discipline
  as too lenient, when respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have agreed that a violation occurred, it may not reject
  consent discipline claiming that there was no violation."   Therefore, the Board cannot conclude that there was no
  violation involving a conflict of interest.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref6" name="_edn6" class="fn" id="_edn6">6</a> There was a representation at
  the Board Panel hearing that the Sheriff may not have received the temporary restraining order prohibiting the sale

  restraining order with him on the day of the sale and the altercation with Steven Raacke.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref7" name="_edn7" class="fn" id="_edn7">7</a> The Board was not provided with
  any supporting material (citation, transcript, etc.) from the contempt proceeding before Judge Hughes.  Rather the
