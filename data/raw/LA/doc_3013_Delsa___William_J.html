  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">BOARD DOCKET NUMBER 02-DB-134</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a petition for consent discipline by
  William J. Delsa ("Respondent") of New Orleans, Louisiana, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of
  Louisiana. For reasons stated below, the Disciplinary Board accepts the petition and orders that a public reprimand
  with conditions be issued against Respondent.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On December 26, 2002, Respondent filed a petition for consent discipline, an affidavit in support
  of consent discipline, and a waiver of opportunity to withdraw consent wherein he admitted to violating Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.4(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4(b)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.8(k)</span>, and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
  id="_ftnref1"><span class="fn">[1]</span></a> Respondent proposes that as a result of these violations he be publicly
  reprimanded with conditions, including a two-year period of probation. The same day, ODC filed its concurrence in the
  petition and a memorandum in support of the proposed sanction. The parties have also filed a joint stipulation of
  facts.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On February 20, 2003, the matter came before a panel of the Disciplinary Board. The parties
  waived appearances; therefore, oral argument was not conducted.</p>

  <h3>STIPULATED FACTS</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The stipulation of facts filed in this matter provides in pertinent parts:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div id="fc02-DB-134">
      <h4>I.</h4>

      <p>William J. Delsa was admitted to the practice of law on October 17, 1980. </p>

      <h4>II.</h4>

      <p>William J. Delsa has no prior disciplinary record despite a very active practice over the past 22 years.</p>

      <h4>III.</h4>

      <p>During his years of practice, William J. Delsa has represented Keith Darby and Alice Darby in several legal
      matters particularly the <i>Hunter</i> matter and the <i>James</i> matter involved in investigative file number
      13312.</p>

      <h4>IV.</h4>

      <p>With respect to the <i>Hunter</i> matter, Keith Darby entered into a contract with Arthur Hunter, Sr. to
      renovate property owned by Mr. Darby and located at 4145 Cleveland Avenue for a total amount of $17,995.00. 
      After performing much of the work, however, Mr. Hunter did not return to the work-site.  Mr. Darby then retained
      Mr. Delsa to file suit against Mr. Hunter for damages.  In connection with the suit, Mr. Darby represented to Mr.
      Delsa that the cost to complete the work begun and partially completed by Mr. Hunter would be approximately
      $55,000.00 even though the original contract was only $17,995.00.</p>

      <h4>V.</h4>

      <p>After suit was filed against Mr. Hunter, Mr. Delsa's daughter was diagnosed with an extremely serious medical
      condition that required him to travel to California for her care.  At the same time, however, Mr. Darby insisted
      that Mr. Delsa prosecute his case against Mr. Hunter immediately. At that time, Mr. Delsa misrepresented the
      status of the case to Mr. Darby and advised that a judgment had already been obtained against Mr. Hunter in an
      effort to satisfy and appease Mr. Darby and to avoid his further complaints.</p>

      <h4>VI.</h4>

      <p>Subsequently, Mr. Delsa informed Mr. Darby of the truth that a judgment had not been obtained.  Mr. Delsa
      offered to [rectify] the matter with Mr. Darby and paid Mr. Darby the sum of $55,000.00 with interest, for an
      approximate total of $69,666.72 out-of-pocket in order to compensate Mr. Darby for the amount he claimed was
      needed to complete the work that Mr. Hunter failed to complete.  Additionally, Mr. Delsa advised Mr. Darby to
      seek other counsel. Despite this payment, Mr. Darby insisted that Mr. Delsa continue to pursue the case against
      Mr. Hunter, free of charge.  The case ultimately went to trial and the Judge found that the damages to Mr. Darby
      were approximately $18,974.23 or near $51,000.00 less than the amount Mr. Darby demanded and received from Mr.
      Delsa.  Mr. Delsa appealed the amount to the Fifth Circuit but the only amount the Fifth Circuit reversed was to
      include interest from the date of judicial demand.  Subsequently, Mr. Hunter filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Mr.
      Darby then insisted that Mr. Delsa file a complaint in bankruptcy court objecting to a discharge in which Mr.
      Delsa did at no charge.  The Complaint Objecting to Discharge was later denied. </p>

      <h4>VII.</h4>

      <p>Mr. Delsa assisted the Darbys in another matter, regarding Sharon James, a tenant of Alice and Keith Darby
      whom they attempted to evict.  The Darbys contended that this tenant's rent was six days late.  The tenant bought
      money orders on time but the Darbys claimed they did not receive them timely. A suit for eviction was instituted
      and a hearing was held and handled by Mr. Delsa at no charge, but the judge ruled that the tenant could remain. 
      Thus, the suit for eviction was unsuccessful.</p>

      <h4>VIII.</h4>

      <p>As a result of the suit for eviction the relationship between the Darbys and Ms. James worsened.  Mr. Delsa
      was requested to send Ms. James a letter of eviction once her lease expired; there was to be no renewal of the
      lease.  Unbeknownst to Mr. Delsa, Ms. James had filed suit against Alice Darby for wrongful eviction, initiated a
      complaint with the U.S. Postal Service alleging that Mr. Darby had tampered with her mail, initiated a complaint
      with the Louisiana Attorney General for housing discrimination and had filed a claim with the Louisiana Real
      Estate Commission, all of which Mr. Delsa was expected to handle at no charge. After months of dealing with this
      matter, Mr. Delsa learned that Ms. James would agree to drop all complaints against the Darbys if her entire
      deposit, approximately $577.34, were returned, and no one had to admit to anything. To resolve the matter, Mr.
      Delsa paid the $577.34 and executed a conciliation agreement on behalf of the Darbys without their consent.  The
      conciliation agreement did not release any of the rights held by the Darbys against Ms. James, but rather
      released the Darbys from potential liability only. </p>

      <h4>IX.</h4>

      <p>William J. Delsa has taken responsibility for his conduct with respect to the Hunter and James matters for
      failing to properly communicate with his clients, settling a case without his clients' consent and engaging in
      conduct involving misrepresentation.</p>

      <h4>X.</h4>

      <p>William J. Delsa's conduct has violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.4(a)</span> (b),
      <span class="allegedrules">1.8 (k)</span> and <span class="allegedrules">8.4 (c)</span> of the Rules of
      Professional Conduct.</p>
    </div>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The petition for consent discipline filed by Respondent states in pertinent parts:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <h4>I.</h4>

    <p>William J. Delsa has tendered to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel his affidavit of Consent Discipline in the
    above captioned proceeding.</p>

    <h4>II.</h4>

    <p>Conditioned upon the stated discipline being imposed, William J. Delsa admits to having violated Rules 1.4(a)(b)
    (failing to properly communicate with his clients), 1.8(k) (settlement without a client's consent) and 8.4(c)
    (engaging in conduct involving misrepresentation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. William J. Delsa admits his
    culpability in the above referenced matter.</p>

    <h4>III.</h4>

    <p>Pursuant to Rule XIX, Section 20, William J. Delsa proposes that he be issued a Public Reprimand with the
    following special conditions as the appropriate discipline for the admitted misconduct in this matter:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>(a) A two-year probationary period, with a practice monitor;</p>

      <p>(b) Completion of the Louisiana State Bar Association's Ethics School; and</p>

      <p>(c) Payment of the costs of these proceedings.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rules 1.4(a),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.4(b)</span>, 1.8(k), and 8.4(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  The Board must
  accept that Respondent has violated these rules.  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96);
  <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given the violation of these rules, the Board is
  left to determine if the proposed sanction of public reprimand and two years probation with special conditions is
  appropriate to address Respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <h2>THE APPROPRIATE SANCTION</h2>

  <h3>I.  Rule XIX, Section 10(C) Factors</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the
      profession;</li>

      <li>whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</li>

      <li>the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</li>

      <li>the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based upon a review of the documents, the Board finds Respondent's actions were in part knowing
  and in part negligent.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" id="_ftnref2"><span class="fn">[2]</span></a> Respondent
  negligently failed to adequately communicate with his clients and he knowingly misrepresented the status of their
  legal matter to his clients. The Board further finds the record does not reflect any significant harm to Respondent's
  clients, Mr. and Mrs. Darby.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on a review of the record, the Board finds the following mitigating factors are present
  here: (1) <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>; (2)
  <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a selfish motive</span>; (3) <span class="ABAstandard">personal
  problems</span>;<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" id="_ftnref3"><span class="fn">[3]</span></a> (4)
  <span class="ABAstandard">timely good faith effort to make restitution or to rectify consequences of
  misconduct</span>; (5) <span class="ABAstandard">full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative
  attitude toward proceedings</span>; and (6) <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
  id="_ftnref4"><span class="fn">[4]</span></a> The Board finds the following aggravating factors are present here: (1)
  <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"
  id="_ftnref5"><span class="fn">[5]</span></a> and (2) <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the
  practice of law</span>.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" id="_ftnref6"><span class="fn">[6]</span></a></p>

  <h3>II.  ABA Standards</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanction</i>
  ("Standard") to determine the baseline sanction by determining "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's mental state
  and the extent of the injury caused; and then adjust[ing] the sanction in accordance with the aggravating and
  mitigating factors present."  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94);
  <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 350</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The proposed sanction is in line with the ABA guidelines.  Under ABA Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.62</span> a "[s]uspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly deceives a
  client, and causes injury or potential injury to a client." Under ABA Standard <span class="ABAstandard">5.13</span>
  a "[r]eprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in any other conduct that involves
  dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation and that adversely reflects on the lawyer's fitness to practice
  law."</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Here, in connection with the Hunter matter, Respondent knowingly deceived the Darbys as to the
  status of their legal matter. Additionally, in connection with the James matter, Respondent executed a conciliation
  agreement on behalf of the Darbys without first obtaining their consent as required by the Rules of Professional
  Conduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Ultimately, Respondent's actions resulted in little, if any, harm to his clients. With regard to
  the Hunter matter, Respondent paid the Darbys approximately $70,000.00 in compensation<a href="#_ftn7"
  name="_ftnref7" id="_ftnref7"><span class="fn">[7]</span></a> and continued to pursue the matter free of charge. With
  regard to the James matter, Respondent paid Ms. James $577.34 prior to executing the conciliation agreement, which
  did not release any of the rights held by the Darbys against Ms. James, but rather released the Darbys from potential
  liability only. Additionally, Respondent did not charge the Darbys a fee to handle the James matter.</p>

  <h3>III. Relevant Case Law</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board also looks to relevant case law for assistance in determining an appropriate sanction
  for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Cases offering guidance here include <span class="CITE"><i>In re
  Dunn</i>, 98-0535 (La. 6/5/98); <a href="../SC/1998-06-05_1998-0535.htm">713 So. 2d 461</a></span> and
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Thompson</i>, 98-0079 (La. 5/8/98); <a href="../SC/1998-05-08_1998-0079.htm">712 So. 2d
  72</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <i>Dunn</i>, <i>supra</i>, the attorney neglected his client's case for five years. As a
  result, the client's case was dismissed on grounds of abandonment. Dunn then tried to settle the potential
  malpractice claim with his client without first advising the client to seek advice from independent counsel.
  <i>Dunn</i>, 713 So. 2d 461, 462. Aggravating factors included prior discipline and substantial experience in the
  practice of law. The most prominent mitigating factor was a finding by the hearing committee that Dunn "intended to
  be fair and reasonable and he was not attempting to exploit his representation of the client."<a href="#_ftn8"
  name="_ftnref8" id="_ftnref8"><span class="fn">[8]</span></a> <i>Id.</i> at 463. The Court determined that under
  those circumstances a deferred suspension of six months, subject to a one-year probationary period was the adequate
  sanction. <i>Id.</i> at 464.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <i>Thompson</i>, <i>supra</i>, a client retained Thompson to handle a worker's compensation
  case. Thompson failed to timely pursue the claim and believed the case had prescribed. Thompson did not have
  professional liability insurance and made a personal agreement with the client to advance her funds up to $7500.00.
  After several cash advances were made, Thompson had his client execute a "distribution statement" drafted in the
  language of a tort claim "receipt and release agreement." <i>Thompson</i>, 712 So. 2d 72, 73. The Court agreed with
  the Disciplinary Board's recommendation that Thompson be suspended for a period of one year, deferred, subject to
  eighteen months of supervised probation with conditions. <i>Id.</i> at 74.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Aggravating factors in <i>Thompson</i> included dishonest or selfish motive, refusal to
  acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, and vulnerability of the victim. Mitigating factors included absence
  of a prior disciplinary record, full and free disclosure during the course of the disciplinary investigation, and
  inexperience in the practice of law.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"
  id="_ftnref9"><span class="fn">[9]</span></a></p>

  <h3>IV. Conclusion</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the ABA guidelines and case law either a deferred suspension or a public reprimand is an
  appropriate sanction for Respondent's misconduct. In this matter, the circumstances suggest a public reprimand most
  adequately addresses Respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Unlike the attorney in <i>Dunn</i>, Respondent's clients' case was not dismissed for abandonment.
  In fact, it remained viable at the time Respondent misrepresented to his clients that the case had been concluded and
  subsequently was tried on the merits. Unlike the attorney in <i>Thompson</i>, Respondent did not allow his clients'
  case to prescribe. Furthermore, the aggravating factors present in this matter do not include a dishonest or selfish
  motive and refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct as seen in <i>Thompson</i>. Finally, in this
  matter, Respondent's clients suffered little, if any, actual harm as a result of Respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">  For reasons assigned above, the Board finds that Respondent's proposed sanction contained in
  his petition for consent discipline is appropriate to address the misconduct in this matter. Accordingly, the Board
  orders that William J. Delsa be issued a public reprimand and be placed on probation for a period of two years,
  subject to the following conditions:</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">(a) Completion of the Louisiana State Bar Association's Ethics School; and</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">(b) Payment of the costs of these proceedings.</p>
