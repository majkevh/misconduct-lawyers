<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 01-B-2375</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: ROBERT B. SCHAMBACH</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from one count 
of formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against 
respondent, Robert B. Schambach, an attorney licensed to practice law in the 
State of Louisiana, but currently suspended from practice.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">In November, 1988, Milton Boylan, III retained respondent to 
represent him in connection with the succession of his stepfather, Harold Smith. 
In lieu of the $2,000 fee requested by respondent to handle this matter, Mr. 
Boylan conveyed title to respondent of a pickup truck belonging to the estate of 
Mr. Smith, which the parties valued at $2,000.<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">While respondent did some initial work in the matter, it is 
undisputed that between 1989 to 1992, respondent took no further steps on behalf 
of Mr. Boylan. In 1993, respondent was suspended from the practice of law for a 
period of one year and one day based on unrelated conduct. <span class="CITE">
<i>In re: Schambach</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:610%20So.2d%20792 --#">610 So. 2d 792</a> 
(La. 1993)</span>. Respondent never advised Mr. Boylan of his suspension, nor 
did he refund the unearned portion of the fee. From 1995 to 1998, Mr. Boylan 
tried on several occasions to contact respondent in person and by telephone, but 
was unable to reach him.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On November 11, 1998, ten years after he retained respondent 
in the succession matter, Mr. Boylan filed a complaint with the ODC. Respondent 
admitted that he had accepted the fee and failed to complete the services 
provided. However, respondent refused to comply with the ODC’s numerous requests 
that he provide an accounting of the unearned fee. </p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDING</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed one count of formal 
charges alleging respondent’s actions violated the following provisions of the 
Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.3 --#">1.3</a></span> (neglect of legal matter),
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.4 --#">1.4</a></span> (failure to 
communicate), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.5 --#">1.5</a></span> 
(failure to refund unearned fees), <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.15 --#">1.15</a></span> (failure to keep client funds and 
property safe) and <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(a)</span> 
(violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an answer. Although respondent asserted the 
complaint was in fact a fee dispute matter not appropriate for disciplinary 
proceedings, he represented he intended to make full restitution to his client 
within two to three weeks. However, respondent never provided an accounting to 
his client, nor did he refund any unearned fees.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-053.HC --#">Recommendation of the Hearing Committee</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After a formal hearing, the hearing committee determined the 
ODC proved the formal charges by clear and convincing evidence. It found 
respondent intentionally and knowingly converted to his own use his client’s 
property and failed to perform services for Mr. Boylan. It further found 
respondent’s actions resulted in actual injury to his client, by depriving him 
of money rightfully belonging to him and delaying his client’s legal matter.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Relying on the Standards 4.11 and 4.41(b) of the ABA’s 
Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions,<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> the committee found 
the baseline sanction for respondent’s misconduct was disbarment. It found no 
mitigating factors were present. As aggravating factors, it recognized 
respondent’s prior disciplinary record,<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> dishonest or selfish 
motive, pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, submission of false evidence, 
false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process, 
refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct, vulnerability of the victims, 
substantial experience in the practice of law,<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> and 
indifference to making restitution. Accordingly, the committee recommended 
respondent be disbarred from the practice of law and, as a condition to 
reinstatement, he be ordered to pay restitution. </p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-053.BD --#">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board
</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board adopted the findings of the hearing 
committee in all respects. The board recognized respondent violated the 
professional rules charged, and that he acted knowingly and intentionally, 
causing actual injury to his client. The board adopted the aggravating factors 
and ABA Standards cited by the committee.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After considering the aggravating factors (particularly 
respondent’s prior discipline) and the length of time over which the misconduct 
occurred (over a twelve year period), the board accepted the recommendation of 
the hearing committee. Accordingly, the board recommended respondent be 
disbarred from the practice of law and ordered to make restitution to Mr. Boylan 
or the Louisiana State Bar Association Client Protection Fund.<a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this 
court to the recommendation of the disciplinary board.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original 
jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V, § 5(B). Consequently, we act as 
triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine 
whether the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence.
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94),
<a href="#!-- #ID:646%20So.2d%20343 --#">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 348</span>;
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Boutall</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:597%20So.2d%20444 --#">597 So. 2d 444</a>, 445 (La. 1992)</span>. 
While we are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the 
hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error 
standard is applicable to the committee’s factual findings. See
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Caulfield</i>, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96),
<a href="#!-- #ID:683%20So.2d%20714 --#">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>;
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94),
<a href="#!-- #ID:633%20So.2d%20150 --#">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record supports the committee’s factual determination 
that the charges against respondent have been proven by clear and convincing 
evidence. It is undisputed that respondent accepted a $2,000 fee from his 
client, but did little, if any, work on the client’s legal matter. Over a 
twelve-year period, respondent made no effort to account for his fee or refund 
the unearned portion of the fee to his client. After he was suspended by this 
court in 1993, he did not give notice of his suspension to his client, nor move 
to withdraw from representation, as mandated by Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 26. 
Finally, during the disciplinary investigation of this matter, respondent made 
false and misleading statements to the ODC, indicating that he would make 
restitution when he had no intent to do so.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Finding evidence of professional misconduct, the sole issue 
presented for our consideration is the appropriate sanction for respondent’s 
actions. In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings 
are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve 
the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="CITE">
<i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. 
The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the 
seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and 
mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. 
Whittington</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 
1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">If respondent’s misconduct were considered in isolation, we 
might not find that disbarment was appropriate. However, we cannot ignore the 
numerous aggravating factors present in this case, including respondent’s 
lengthy history of prior discipline for similar misconduct. Quite simply, 
respondent’s consistent lack of regard for the welfare of his clients 
convincingly demonstrates that he lacks the fitness to practice law in this 
state. Accordingly, we will accept the board’s recommendation and disbar 
respondent from the practice of law.</p>
<h2>DECREE </h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the 
hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is 
ordered that the name of Robert B. Schambach be stricken from the roll of 
attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be 
revoked. Respondent is ordered to make full restitution to Mr. Boylan or the 
Client Protection Fund. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed 
against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal 
interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s 
judgment until paid.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">&nbsp;1</a> Respondent initially 
represented to the ODC that he had accepted $2,000 in cash from Mr. Boylan, but 
later admitted that he accepted the truck in lieu of the fee. Respondent never 
recorded the title of the truck into his name, and it was eventually towed away 
as an abandoned vehicle.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> Standard 4.11 provides disbarment is 
generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly converts client property and 
causes injury or potential injury to a client. Standard 4.41 provides disbarment 
is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for a 
client and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> In addition to the 1993 suspension 
discussed earlier (which resulted from commingling and conversion of client 
funds), respondent was suspended from the practice of law for a period of three 
years when he borrowed $40,000 from the client and failed to repay the sum.
