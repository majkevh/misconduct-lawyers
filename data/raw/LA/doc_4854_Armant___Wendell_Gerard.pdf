  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 04-B-2232</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: WENDELL G. ARMANT</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, William G. Armant, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana but currently on
  interim suspension.</p>

  <h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Before we address the current charges, we find it helpful to review respondent's prior
  disciplinary and ineligibility history. Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in Louisiana in 1992. Three
  years later, in 1995, respondent was disciplined for the first time, in the form of an admonition by the disciplinary
  board for incompetence, neglect of a legal matter, and failure to communicate with his client. In 1997, respondent
  was again admonished by the disciplinary board for neglect of legal matters and failure to communicate with his
  client.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On July 5, 2001, this court ordered that respondent be placed on interim suspension pursuant to a
  joint motion filed by respondent and the ODC. <span class="cite">In re: Armant, 01-1918 (La. 7/5/01), 791 So. 2d
  631</span>. Thereafter, respondent filed a petition for consent discipline with this court. The petition proposed
  that respondent be disbarred from the practice of law for his substantial pattern of misconduct, including neglect of
  legal matters, failure to communicate with his clients, failure to protect his clients' interests upon termination of
  the representation, engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, commingling and
  converting client and third-party funds, and failure to cooperate with the ODC. We rejected the petition for consent
  discipline and remanded the matter for further proceedings. <span class="cite">In re: Armant, 01-3004 (La. 4/24/02),
  <a href="2002-04-24_2001-3004.htm">814 So. 2d 1289</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having considered the background of respondent's prior disciplinary infractions we now turn to an
  examination of the current charges against him.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed two sets of formal charges against respondent. The first set of formal charges
  bears the disciplinary board's docket number 02-DB-042 and consists of a consolidation of the three sets of formal
  charges subject of respondent's previous petition for consent discipline as follows: 00-DB-077 filed on June 19, 2000
  and encompassing twenty counts of misconduct, 00-DB-136 filed on November 6, 2000 and encompassing one count of
  misconduct, and 01-DB-022 filed on February 12, 2001 and encompassing two counts of misconduct. The second set of
  formal charges bears the disciplinary board's docket number 02-DB-105, consists of eleven counts of misconduct, and
  was filed on October 17, 2002. The two sets of charges were heard by different hearing committees before being
  consolidated by an order of the chair of the disciplinary board adjudicative committee on April 15, 2004.</p>

  <h4>Count XI - The Brannan Matter</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On July 24, 2001, Nanci Brannan hired respondent to prepare a partnership agreement and represent
  her until the agreement was finalized. At this time, respondent was on interim suspension but failed to inform Ms.
  Brannan of his inability to practice law. Ms. Brannan gave respondent a $1,500 watch as payment for his services.
  Despite numerous attempts, Ms. Brannan was unable to contact respondent directly. As such, respondent failed to
  provide Ms. Brannan with the agreement on time. When he did finally deliver it, it was incomplete. Subsequently,
  respondent failed to adequately communicate with his client. Furthermore, when Ms. Brannan confronted respondent with
  his suspension, he denied ever agreeing to do legal work and insisted he was only acting as a business consultant. He
  also failed to respond when Ms. Brannan requested the return of her watch.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Ms. Brannan filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC in November 2001. Respondent failed

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <h4>02-DB-042</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The formal charges in 02-DB-042 (which, as noted earlier, encompassed 00- DB-077, 00-DB-136 and
  01-DB-022) allege respondent's conduct constitutes a violation of the following Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.1</span> (failure to provide competent representation to a client),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with diligence and promptness in representing a client),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.5</span>
  (fee arrangements), <span class="allegedrules">1.15</span> (safekeeping property of clients or third persons),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> (obligations upon termination of the representation),
  <span class="allegedrules">3.2</span> (failure to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or
  misrepresentation), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation), as well as a violation of Supreme Court <span class="allegedrules">Rule XIX, § 9(c)</span> (knowing
  failure to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent answered the three sets of formal charges consolidated into 02-DB-042 and essentially
  denied any misconduct. Thereafter, the hearing committee conducted a formal hearing. Neither respondent nor counsel
  on his behalf appeared at the hearing. The ODC introduced four binders of documentary evidence in support of the
  allegations against respondent. The ODC also called several witnesses to testify before the committee about
  respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <h4><a href="../HC/2003-04-30_02-DB-042.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After considering the documentary evidence and live testimony, the hearing committee determined
  that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges. The committee found the
  witnesses to be credible and found respondent's failure to participate in the hearing a reinforcement of the formal
  charges against him. In reviewing respondent's sworn statement given prior to the hearing, the committee noted that
  respondent made numerous excuses that showed a pattern of neglect, lack of diligence, and lack of
  communication.<a name="fnref5" class="fn" href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on this evidence, the committee found respondent has engaged in a pattern of misconduct,
  resulting in repeated violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The committee further found that respondent
  acted knowingly and intentionally and caused harm to his clients, the public, and the profession. The committee
  determined that disbarment was the baseline sanction under the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions.
  Moreover, based on Supreme Court Rule XIX, Appendix E and this court's prior jurisprudence, it found permanent
  disbarment was appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee found the following aggravating factors were present: dishonest or selfish motive,
  a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally
  failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, and refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of
  the conduct. It found no mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, the committee recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred, make full
  restitution to his victims, and be assessed with all costs of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3>02-DB-105</h3>

  <h4>Formal Charges</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The formal charges in 02-DB-105 allege that respondent's conduct constitutes a violation of the
  following Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.1</span>,
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span>, <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span>,
  <span class="allegedrules">1.5(f)(6)</span> (failure to refund an unearned fee),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.15</span>, <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span>,
  <span class="allegedrules">3.2</span>, <span class="allegedrules">5.5</span> (engaging in the unauthorized practice
  of law), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(b)</span> (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on the lawyer's honesty,
  trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span>, and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span>, as well as a violation of Supreme Court <span class="allegedrules">Rule
  XIX, § 9(c)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was served with the formal charges via certified mail. However, he failed to answer or
  other reply. Accordingly, the factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear and
  convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). No formal hearing was held, but the parties were
  given an opportunity to file with the hearing committee written arguments and documentary evidence on the issue of
  sanctions. Respondent filed nothing for the hearing committee's consideration.</p>

  <h4><a href="../HC/2004-03-18_02-DB-105.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee determined that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in
  the formal charges.<a name="fnref6" class="fn" href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a> The committee also made factual findings
  in each count that mirror the facts stated above in the formal charges section.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee determined respondent commingled and converted funds and failed to provide
  accountings for his fees or refund unearned fees. It further found he failed to communicate with his clients or
  provide diligent representation to them, and also failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigations.
  Furthermore, it concluded respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by accepting the representation of a
  client after he had been suspended from the practice of law, an act which harmed his client, the public, the legal
  system, and the profession.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the committee determined the baseline
  sanction for respondent's misconduct was disbarment. However, the committee also recognized that respondent's
  misconduct falls into two of the permanent disbarment guidelines.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In aggravation, the committee found prior disciplinary offenses, dishonest or selfish motive, a
  pattern of misconduct, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with
  rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, and indifference to making restitution. The committee found no mitigating
  factors were present.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these findings, the committee recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred from
  the practice of law. Furthermore, he should be assessed with all costs of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the hearing committee's
  recommendation.<a name="fnref7" class="fn" href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></p>

  <h4><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-08-31_02-DB-042.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As noted, the disciplinary board consolidated the charges in 02-DB-042 and 02- DB-105 for its
  review. As to 02-DB-042, the board found no manifest error in the committee's findings as to Counts I - VIII, XI, and
  XVII of former case number 00- DB-077. However, the board did find manifest error in the committee's findings as to
  Counts XII - XVI and Counts XVIII - XX of former case number 00-DB-077, noting that the ODC did not submit the
  testimony of the complainants in support of the substantive allegations at the hearing. Nonetheless, it found the
  allegations of failure to cooperate with the ODC were supported by the evidence submitted at the hearing.
  Furthermore, the board found that only Rules 1.15(b) and 8.4(g) were violated in connection with Counts IX and X of
  former case number 00-DB-077. The committee's determinations regarding all counts of former case number 00-DB-136 and
  former case number 01-DB-022 were correct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As to 02-DB-105, the board found no manifest error in the committee's findings. However, the
  board noted that the committee failed to find violations of Rule 1.4 as to Count VII and Rule 8.4(a) as to Count IX
  when respondent had, in fact, violated these rules as alleged in the two counts.<a name="fnref8" class="fn"
  href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Despite the board's determination that several counts were not proven, it found the remaining
  counts revealed respondent engaged in numerous instances of neglect of legal matters, failure to communicate, failure
  to promptly pay third-party medical providers, failure to return client files, failure to refund unearned fees, and
  failure to cooperate with the ODC. Furthermore, it noted respondent converted client funds on three occasions and
  engaged in the unauthorized practice of law after being suspended. It noted all of this misconduct caused substantial
  harm to respondent's clients.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Citing the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the board determined indicates
  disbarment was the appropriate baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct. Further, it noted respondent's
  conversion of client funds and unauthorized practice of law falls into the permanent disbarment guidelines.
  Additionally, this court's prior jurisprudence also supports permanent disbarment for respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board determined that the following aggravating factors were present:
  <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316
  (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in
  any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the
  manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings. See <span class="cite">In re: Caulfield,
  96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class="cite">In re:
  Pardue, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon our review, we determine that the findings of the hearing committees, as modified by
  the disciplinary board, are supported by clear and convincing evidence in the record. Without burdening the reader
  with a detailed recitation of this misconduct, it suffices to say respondent engaged in numerous instances of neglect
  of legal matters, failure to communicate with his clients, failure to promptly remit funds to his clients and
  third-party medical providers, failure to protect his clients' interests upon termination of the representation,
  failure to refund unearned fees, engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, and
  failure to cooperate with the ODC. Most significantly, the record reveals respondent mishandled client and
  third-party funds, converting substantial amounts of these funds to his own use, and flouted the authority of this
  court by engaging in the unauthorized practice of law after we placed him on interim suspension.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found indisputable evidence of professional misconduct, we now turn to consideration of
  the sanction. In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to
  maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future
  misconduct. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d
  1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of
  the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a>
  (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Unquestionably, the baseline sanction for respondent's egregious misconduct in this case is
  disbarment. However, the disciplinary board urges us to go further and consider permanently prohibiting respondent
  from seeking readmission to the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In Appendix E to Supreme Court Rule XIX, we set forth guidelines illustrating the types of
  conduct which might warrant permanent disbarment. While these guidelines are not intended to bind this court in its
  decision-making process, they present useful information concerning the types of conduct we might consider worthy of
  permanent disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Applying those guidelines to the instant case, we find respondent's conversion of client and
  third party funds falls within the scope of <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 1</span>, which applies to "Repeated
  or multiple instances of intentional conversion of client funds with substantial harm". Likewise, we find his
  decision to engage in the unauthorized practice of law following his interim suspension implicates
  <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 8</span> ("Following notice, engaging in the unauthorized practice of law . . .
  during the period of time in which the lawyer is suspended from the practice of law or disbarred"). The numerous
  aggravating factors present - prior disciplinary offenses, dishonest or selfish motive, a pattern of misconduct,
  multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceedings by intentionally failing to comply with
  rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, and refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct — only reinforce
  the conclusion that permanent disbarment is warranted.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In summary, we find the egregious and persistent nature of the respondent's misconduct, combined
  with the numerous aggravating factors, convincingly establishes that he is not morally fit to practice law. He has
  victimized both clients and third parties in the past and it is highly likely he will continue to do so in the future
  if given an opportunity. Under these circumstances, we would be remiss in our constitutional duties to regulate the
  practice of law if we did not disbar respondent on a permanent basis.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board's recommendation and impose permanent
  disbarment.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that the name of Wendell G. Armant, Louisiana Bar Roll number 21225, be
  stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked.
  Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered that respondent be permanently prohibited from
  being readmitted to the practice of law in this state. Respondent is ordered to provide complete accountings and full
  restitution to his victims. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with
  Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's
  judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> In addition to prior discipline, we

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3" id="fn3">3</a> It is unclear from the record whether

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn8" class="fn" href="#fnref8" id="fn8">8</a> The committee actually failed to find
