<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: RAPHAEL P. POIRRIER</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

<p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

<p class="bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from one count of formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) against respondent, Raphael P. Poirrier, a disbarred attorney.</p>

<h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY RECORD</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">Before addressing the instant charges, we find it helpful to review respondent's prior disciplinary history.&nbsp; Between 1996 and 1998, respondent accepted representation in six client matters.&nbsp; After being retained in these matters, respondent did no work on behalf of his 
clients and failed to return their files or refund unearned fees.&nbsp; The ODC filed formal charges against respondent.&nbsp; Finding the charges were proven by clear and convincing evidence, we disbarred respondent.&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Poirrier</i>, 01-1116, 01-1118 (La. 6/29/01),
<a href="#!-- #ID:791 So.2d 94 --#">791 So. 2d 94</a></span> (&quot;<i>Poirrier I</i>&quot;).</p>

<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

<p class="bodycopy">In May 1996, respondent assumed the representation of Tanya King in a pending personal injury case.&nbsp; In July 1996, respondent wrote to the defendant insurance company and offered to settle Ms. King's claim.&nbsp; Thereafter, respondent neglected his client's legal matter, 
and in July 1998, the case was dismissed on grounds of abandonment.&nbsp; Respondent failed to inform Ms. King of this fact.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">In November 2000, Ms. King filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC.&nbsp; Respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the complaint.</p>

<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

<p class="bodycopy">On October 22, 2001, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent, alleging his conduct violated the following provisions of the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness 
in representing a client), <span class="Rules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a client), <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation), <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct), <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> 
(engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation).&nbsp; The formal charges were served upon respondent by certified mail received on January 17, 2002.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" 
class="fn" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="bodycopy">Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges. Accordingly, the factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 11(E)(3).&nbsp; No formal hearing was held, but the 
parties were given an opportunity to file with the hearing committee written arguments and documentary evidence on the issue of sanctions.</p>

<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-108.HC --#">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></h3>

<p class="Bodycopy">Noting the factual allegations of the formal charges were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Rule XIX, &sect; 11(E)(3), the hearing committee agreed that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged.&nbsp; After consideration of 
the ODC's submission in response to the deemed admitted order,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" class="fn" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> the committee concluded that respondent undertook to represent Ms. King and actually attempted to settle her case before allowing it to be abandoned.&nbsp; The committee 
found respondent's conduct was knowing and intentional and caused actual harm to his client, Ms. King, whose lawsuit was dismissed due to abandonment and who therefore was deprived of the right to pursue her personal injury claim.&nbsp; Respondent's conduct further harmed the legal profession, the 
legal system, and the public at large.&nbsp; The committee recognized no mitigating factors, but determined the aggravating factors present include respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary 
proceeding</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct</span>.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, the committee recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-108.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>

<p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board agreed respondent acted knowingly when he violated duties owed to his client, to the legal system, and as a professional.&nbsp; The conduct caused actual harm to Ms. King, whose lawsuit was dismissed as abandoned.&nbsp; Respondent's failure to cooperate in 
the disciplinary investigation impaired the efficient operation of the disciplinary process and caused harm to the legal profession as a whole.&nbsp; Considering the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, the board determined the baseline sanction for this conduct is a suspension from 
the practice of law.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Nevertheless, the board recognized that when a second attorney disciplinary proceeding involves misconduct which occurred during the same time period as the first proceeding, the overall discipline to be imposed should be determined as if both proceedings were being considered 
simultaneously. The board pointed out that the misconduct at issue in <i>Poirrier I</i> arose out of respondent's representation of six clients between 1996 and 1998, the same time frame in which respondent represented Ms. King.&nbsp; Moreover, the same type of misconduct is involved in 
the instant case as was at issue in <i>Poirrier I</i>.&nbsp; Accordingly, the board determined that additional discipline is not warranted for respondent's conduct in the King matter; rather, the board recommended that respondent be adjudged guilty of additional violations warranting suspension 
which would be considered in the event he applies for readmission from his disbarment in <i>Poirrier I</i>.&nbsp; The board further recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality 
of the court's judgment until paid.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

<p class="bodycopy">The deemed admitted facts in this case support the conclusion that respondent neglected his client's legal matter, resulting in the dismissal of her personal injury suit on grounds of abandonment.&nbsp; Therefore, the sole issue presented for our consideration is the appropriate 
sanction for respondent's misconduct.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct.&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:513 So.2d 1173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.&nbsp; The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana 
State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:459 So.2d 520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Respondent's neglect of Ms. King's legal matter caused actual harm to her.&nbsp; Furthermore, respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation, thereby impairing the efficient operation of the disciplinary process.&nbsp; No mitigating factors are supported by the 
record; however, some aggravating factors are present.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, we conclude a suspension from the practice of law is the proper sanction.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Nevertheless, as the disciplinary board properly recognized, the instant misconduct occurred in the same time frame as the misconduct forming the basis of respondent's earlier disbarment.&nbsp; In <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:573 So.2d 470 --#">573 So. 2d 470</a> (La. 1991)</span>, we observed that when the underlying conduct occurs within the same period as the misconduct forming the basis for a previous disbarment, the discipline imposed should be determined as if both proceedings were before the 
court simultaneously.&nbsp; Applying this procedure in <i>Chatelain</i>, we declined to extend the minimum period for readmission.&nbsp; Instead, we adjudged the respondent guilty of additional violations warranting disbarment which were added to his record for consideration in the event he applied 
for readmission after becoming eligible to do so.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction in the instant case, we believe the approach of <i>Chatelain</i> is instructive.&nbsp; Accordingly, our determination of a sanction will be based upon the appropriate sanction we would have imposed if these charges had been before the court 
at the same time as the charges in <i>Poirrier I</i>.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Had the instant charges been filed simultaneously with those charges forming the basis of <i>Poirrier I</i>, they would have only reinforced our view that respondent lacks the moral fitness to practice law and must be disbarred, both as a sanction for his misconduct and to 
protect the public.&nbsp; Therefore, as in <i>Chatelain</i>, we will adjudge respondent guilty of additional violations which warrant discipline and which will be added to his record for consideration in the event he applies for readmission after becoming eligible to do so. We further emphasize that 
although respondent may have a procedural right to apply for readmission, we retain absolute discretion to grant or deny readmission, and will carefully scrutinize any application for readmission with a critical eye.</p>

<h2>DECREE</h2>

<p class="bodycopy">&nbsp;For the reasons assigned, it is ordered that Raphael P. Poirrier be adjudged guilty of additional violations which warrant discipline and which will be added to his record for consideration in the event he applies for readmission after becoming eligible to do so.&nbsp; All costs 
and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
