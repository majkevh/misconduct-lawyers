  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: BRUCE WILLIAMS</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from consolidated formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Bruce Williams, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <h2>01-DB-052</h2>

  <h3>The Course Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In November 1996, Lucille Course hired respondent to handle a personal injury claim. Respondent did not file a lawsuit on her behalf until November 5, 1997, three days after prescription on the claim had run. He did not inform Ms. Course of his failure to file suit timely or advise her to seek independent counsel about a possible malpractice claim against him. He also failed to respond to Ms. Course's requests for status updates, despite her numerous phone calls.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct in this matter violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a client), and <span class="allegedrules">1.8</span> (conflict of interest) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2>04-DB-048</h2>

  <h3>Count I – The Demetrice Johnson Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In February 1996, Demetrice Johnson hired respondent to handle a personal injury claim. Respondent failed to adequately communicate with Ms. Johnson or provide her with requested status updates, despite her numerous phone calls. He also stopped working on her legal matter without notifying her. Thereafter, respondent failed to fully cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of Ms. Johnson's complaint.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct in this matter violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, and <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count II – The Gould Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In June 1998, Jyronne Gould hired respondent to handle a personal injury claim. Respondent failed to adequately communicate with Mr. Gould or provide him with requested status updates, despite his numerous phone calls. He also stopped working on Mr. Gould's legal matter without notifying him. Thereafter, respondent failed to fully cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of Mr. Gould's complaint. The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct in this matter violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 8.1(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count III – The Gisele Johnson Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In November 1995, Gisele Johnson hired respondent to handle a medical malpractice claim. Respondent failed to move the matter forward and failed to respond to Ms. Johnson's numerous phone calls. He also failed to fully cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of Ms. Johnson's complaint.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct in this matter violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 8.1(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count IV – The Smith Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In January 2001, Walter Smith hired respondent to handle a lawsuit against the Housing Authority of New Orleans. Respondent failed to respond to Mr. Smith's phone calls or correspondence requesting status updates.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct in this matter violated Rule 1.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2>05-DB-034</h2>

  <h3>Count I – The Young Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In December 1996, Nolan Young hired respondent to handle a personal injury claim. Respondent filed suit on Mr. Young's behalf but failed to move the matter forward. He also failed to respond to Mr. Young's numerous phone calls. Soon after receiving notice of Mr. Young's disciplinary complaint against him, respondent withdrew from his case. However, he failed to notify Mr. Young of his withdrawal.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct in this matter violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, and <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> (obligations upon termination of the representation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count II – The Ward Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 1995, Patricia Ward hired respondent to handle a personal injury claim. Respondent failed to move the matter forward and failed to adequately communicate with Ms. Ward. He also failed to fully cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of Ms. Ward's complaint.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct in this matter violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 8.1(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent did not file answers to the three sets of formal charges. Instead, he filed a motion to consolidate and set for hearing in mitigation. In his motion, respondent admitted that he violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges. The hearing committee chair ordered that the cases be consolidated and set for a hearing in mitigation. However, respondent failed to appear at the hearing.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2006-03-24_01-DB-052.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee determined that the factual allegations in the formal charges were supported by the evidence. Accordingly, it concluded respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In aggravation, the committee determined that respondent engaged in a pattern of misconduct that resulted in repeated violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. It further found respondent showed no remorse. The only mitigating factor found by the committee is the absence of a prior disciplinary record.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on its findings, the committee recommended that respondent be disbarred and be assessed with all costs of these proceedings. Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2006-11-09_01-DB-052.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the record, the disciplinary board found that respondent violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4</span>, <span class="Rules">1.8</span>, <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. It noted he acted knowingly, if not intentionally, and caused actual harm to his clients. It also concluded he knowingly failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigations, which placed an unnecessary burden on the disciplinary system. As aggravating factors, the board found a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, and a refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct. The board also observed that respondent failed to appear at the hearing, which was scheduled at his request and solely for his benefit.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After considering the prior jurisprudence involving similar misconduct,<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a> the board recommended that respondent be disbarred and be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings. Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V, § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings. See <span class="cite">In re: Caulfield, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class="cite">In re: Pardue, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The undisputed evidence in the record of this matter reveals that respondent neglected six legal matters, failed to communicate with seven clients, failed to protect one client's interest upon termination of the representation, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in four investigations. Respondent also allowed one client's claim to prescribe and did not inform her that she may have a malpractice claim against him for his failure to file suit on time. This conduct violates Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.8, 1.16(d), and 8.1(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found evidence of professional misconduct, we now turn to a determination of the appropriate sanction for respondent's actions. In considering this issue, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In cases involving multiple instances of neglect, failure to communicate with clients, and failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigations, we have often disbarred lawyers. See, e.g., <span class="cite">In re: Brancato, 06-0124 (La. 5/26/06), <a href="2006-05-24_2006-0124.htm">932 So. 2d 651</a></span> (attorney disbarred for numerous instances of neglect, failure to communicate, and failure to cooperate); <span class="cite">In re: Poirrier, 01-1116, 01-1118 (La. 6/29/01), <a href="2001-06-29_2001-1116.htm">791 So. 2d 94</a></span> (attorney disbarred for abandoning his law practice, neglecting several legal matters, failing to communicate with his clients, failing to account for or refund unearned fees and/or unused costs, failing to return his clients' files, and failing to cooperate with the ODC).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Aggravating factors present in the instant matter are <span class="ABAstandard">a pattern of misconduct</span> and <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>. The sole mitigating factor is respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">lack of a prior disciplinary record</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the record as a whole, we conclude respondent has failed to comply with the high ethical standards expected of lawyers in this state. His chronic neglect of legal matters entrusted to him as well as his lack of regard for the welfare of his clients reveals he is a danger to the public. Accordingly, he must be disbarred.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that Bruce Williams, Louisiana Bar Roll number 21156, be and he hereby is disbarred. His name shall be stricken from the roll of attorneys, and his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana shall be revoked. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> Apparently, respondent's home and office were destroyed during Hurricane Katrina. Although he did not notify the Louisiana State Bar Association of a change in his bar registration address, the ODC was able to locate him at his father's residence in Alabama following the hurricane. On January 6, 2006, Ronald Beaver, the ODC's investigator, spoke with respondent on his cell phone. Respondent informed Mr. Beaver that the ODC could send correspondence to him at his father's residence. On January 12, 2006, notice of the hearing date was delivered to respondent at his father's residence via Federal Express. Notice was also sent to respondent's bar registration address via regular mail. Furthermore, Mr. Beaver left several voicemail messages for respondent on his cell phone informing him of the hearing date. Nonetheless, respondent failed to appear.</p>

		<p class="headingstyle">IN RE: BRUCE R. WILLIAMS</p>
		<p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
		<p class="headingstyle">JOHNSON, J., would grant the rehearing:</p>
		<h2>Was the Rehearing Application Timely?</h2>
		<p class="Bodycopy">The Supreme Court Clerk does not file a Notice of 
		Judgment into the record when a per curiam is issued, and, in the 
		absence of the notice, there is no definitive answer as to when the 
		judgment was mailed. Therefore, we can only assume that the judgment was 
		mailed to respondent on the same date that this Court rendered the 
		judgment.</p>
		<h2>Defective Notice of Disciplinary Board Hearing</h2>
		<p class="Bodycopy">The record demonstrates that notice of the 
		respondent&#39;s initial charge, filed on May 24, 2001, was sent via 
		certified mail to the respondent at 1515 Poydras Street, Suite 2222, New 
		Orleans, LA. According to a minute entry filed on July 22, 2005, the 
		respondent confirmed that his office had relocated and all 
		correspondence should be sent to 1008 Jourdan Avenue, New Orleans, LA 
		70117 (which was also his residence). Respondent&#39;s mitigation hearing 
		was first scheduled for September 28, 2005, a month after Hurricane 
		Katrina devastated Louisiana, then rescheduled for February 17, 2006. 
		The record also demonstrates that the &quot;Notice of Committee Hearing,&quot; for 
		February 17, 2006 hearing, stated the following:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I, Donna L. Roberts, the undersigned Administrator for the 
			Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board, certify that a copy of the 
			foregoing Notice Hearing has been mailed to the Respondent and 
			Disciplinary Counsel, by United States Mail, prepaid, this 29th day 
			of December, 2005 at the following address:</p>
			<p>Mr. Bruce R. Willams<br>
			Tate &amp; Williams, LLC<br>
			1008 Jourdan Avenue<br>
			P.O. Box 5889<br>
			New Orleans. LA 70158-8889<a name="dfnref1" class="fn" href="#dfn1">1</a></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="Bodycopy">On April 13, 2007, the Bywater Station Manager of 
		the United States Post Office, the post office responsible for 
		delivering mail/packages to the lower ninth ward, reported &quot;there was no 
		delivery service to 1008 Jourdan Avenue until two weeks ago, as the 
		address did not have a box.&quot;</p>
		<p class="Bodycopy">A &quot;Revised&quot; notice, dated January 6, 2006, was 
		mailed to: PO Box 58889, New Orleans, LA 70158-8889, and another 
		&quot;Revised&quot; notice was mailed to 480 Usher Road, Harvest, Alabama 35749. 
		The record also shows that on December 29, 2005, notice was sent via 
		federal express to 1008 Jourdan, New Orleans, LA 70158. According to the 
		affidavit of the Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board&#39;s (LADB&#39;s) docket 
		clerk, a federal express package was delivered to the respondent&#39;s 
		father&#39;s address in Harvest, Alabama on January 12, 2006 and &quot;left at 
		the front door&quot; of that residence. The affidavit of Ronald Beaver, the 
		investigator for the LADB, suggests that the respondent had actual 
		notice of the hearing as he left messages for the respondent with his 
		elderly father and brother, and also left cell phone messages for the 
		respondent to call the ODC</p>
		<p class="Bodycopy">It is important to note that the respondent&#39;s <i>
		office</i> and <i>residence</i> were located in the Lower Ninth Ward of 
		New Orleans. As a result of media coverage, people all over the world 
		are aware of the levee breach which destroyed nearly every structure in 
		that section of the City following Hurricane Katrina. The ODC details 
		the numerous efforts made to reach respondent via his cell phone 
		(messages left), then notes his failure to appear for the hearing 
		scheduled for February 17, 2006, here in New Orleans. Very little 
		business as usual was going on in New Orleans six months post-Katrina. 
		However, the ODC assigned an investigator to conduct a comprehensive 
		search for the respondent. Respondent alleges, and it is unrefuted, that 
		he has lived in Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, and in other parts of 
		Louisiana since the storm. This sole practitioner apparently had no 
		permanent office, telephone number or support staff during this period 
		of time.</p>
		<h2>Appropriate Discipline</h2>
		<p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) argued that 
		the respondent violated Rules 1.3 (failure to act with reasonable 
		diligence and promptness in representing a client); 1.4 (failure to 
		communicate with a client); 1.9 (conflict of interest); 1.16(d) 
		(obligations upon termination of the representation; and 8.1( c) 
		(failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) of the Rules of 
		Professional Conduct. The respondent requested a hearing to present 
		evidence of his mitigating circumstances that contributed to his alleged 
		misconduct. The respondent alleged that during the time of the alleged 
		misconduct, he was diagnosed with diabetes, and in addition was caring 
		for a sick mother. The ODC argued that the respondent failed to appear 
		at the mitigation hearing, which was first scheduled for September 28, 
		2005, a month after Hurricane Katrina devastated Louisiana, then 
		rescheduled for February 17, 2006.</p>
		<p class="Bodycopy">In cases involving instances of neglect, failure to 
		communicate with clients, and failure to cooperate with the ODC in its 
		investigations, the Court has imposed sanctions ranging from suspensions 
		to disbarment.<a name="dfnref2" class="fn" href="#dfn2">2</a> In
		<span class="cite"><i>In re: Waltzer</i>, 04-1032 (La. 10/8/04),
		<a href="2004-10-08_2004-1032.htm">883 So. 2d 973</a></span>, the Court 
		imposed a two-year suspension upon an attorney who, among other 
		misconduct, neglected three legal matters, failed to communicate with 
		three clients, failed to properly terminate representations, and failed 
		to cooperate with the ODC. In <span class="cite"><i>In re: Wharton</i>, 
		03-1816 (La. 10/17/03), <a href="2003-10-17_2003-1816.htm">872 So. 2d 
		459</a></span>, the Court imposed a three-year suspension upon an 
		attorney who neglected seven legal matters, failed to communicate with 
		four clients, failed to refund unearned fees to five clients, and failed 
		to cooperate with the ODC in three investigations. In <span class="cite">
		<i>In re: Romero</i>, 04-3087 (La. 4/29/05),
		<a href="2005-04-29_2004-3087.htm">900 So. 2d 819</a></span>, the 
		attorney was involved in numerous instances of neglect and failure to 
		communicate as well as one instance of conversion of less than $2,000. 
		For this misconduct, the attorney was suspended from the practice of law 
		for three years.<span class="cite"> </span>In <span class="cite"><i>In 
		re: Brown</i>, 04-1119 (La. 1/14/05), <a href="2005-01-14_2004-1119.htm">
		892 So. 2d 1</a></span>, the attorney was suspended for three years for 
		neglecting several legal matters, failing to communicate with clients, 
		failing to refund unearned fees, and failing to cooperate with the ODC. 
		In <span class="cite"><i>In re: Phelps</i>, 02-1837 (La. 9/30/02),
		<a href="2002-09-30_2002-1837.htm">827 So. 2d 1140</a></span>, the 
		attorney was involved in seven instances of neglect of legal matters and 
		failure to communicate with clients. Because the attorney&#39;s misconduct 
		was a result of poor management skills, rather than dishonest or 
		improper motives, this Court imposed a deferred one-year suspension with 
		two years of supervised probation.</p>
		<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter involves an attorney, who 
		allegedly neglected legal matters and failed to communicate with 
		clients. Mr. Williams&#39; situation is more akin to <i>In re Phleps</i>, 
		where this Court, because the attorney&#39;s misconduct was a result of poor 
		management skills, rather than dishonest or improper motives, decided 
		that disbarment was not warranted. In light of the fact that respondent 
		was not charged with any instances of conversion of client funds or 
		failure to refund unearned fees, a deferred suspension followed by 
		supervised probation would be adequate discipline. The recommendation to 
		disbar apparently was not related to the severity of the original 
		charges that were lodged against the respondent, but was based on his 
		failure to cooperate, namely appear at the February 17, 2006 hearing.</p>
		<p class="Bodycopy">We must presume that respondent had to reconstruct 
		records, if both his home and office were destroyed. With all the 
		concessions made for other Hurricane Katrina survivors, I find the 
		zealous pursuit of this sole practitioner in this bar matter, 
		particularly offensive.</p>
