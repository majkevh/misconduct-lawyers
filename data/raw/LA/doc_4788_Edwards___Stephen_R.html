  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from one count of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Stephen R. Edwards, an attorney licensed to practice law in
  Louisiana but currently on interim suspension.<a class="fn" href="#fn1" name="fnref1" id="fnref1">1</a></p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On November 6, 1998, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging respondent and others
  with racketeering, extortion, mail and wire fraud, money laundering, false statements, illegal wiretapping, and
  conspiracy in connection with the awarding of Louisiana riverboat gaming licenses.<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2"
  id="fnref2">2</a> United States v. Edwin Edwards, Stephen Edwards, Cecil Brown, Andrew Martin, Bobby Johnson, and
  Gregory Tarver, No. 98-165 on the Criminal Docket of the United States District Court for the Middle District of
  Louisiana. On May 9, 2000, a jury found respondent guilty of eighteen felony counts involving racketeering,
  extortion, mail and wire fraud, and money laundering; however, six mail and wire fraud convictions were subsequently
  dismissed by the district court.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a> Respondent was sentenced to serve
  seven years in federal prison.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On August 23, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed
  respondent's conviction and sentence. United States v. Edwards, 303 F.3d 606 (5 th Cir. 2002). The conviction became
  final on February 24, 2003, upon the denial of respondent's petition for writ of certiorari by the United States
  Supreme Court. Edwards v. United States, 537 U.S. 1192 (2003).</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On July 17, 2000, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent arising out of his
  conviction. On August 2, 2000, respondent answered the formal charges and admitted his conviction, but requested that
  the disciplinary proceeding be held in abeyance pending the finality of the conviction. Following the United States
  Supreme Court's denial of certiorari in the criminal case, the disciplinary matter proceeded to a formal hearing on
  the merits, which was conducted before the hearing committee on May 30, 2003.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC submitted documentary evidence in support of the formal charges. Respondent was
  incarcerated at the time of the hearing and thus did not appear in person, but his counsel called three attorneys to
  testify on his behalf. These witnesses provided testimony primarily in the nature of character evidence. Furthermore,
  each of the witnesses expressed his view that permanent disbarment should not be applied to respondent or is
  otherwise not an appropriate sanction for the crimes of which respondent was convicted.</p>

  <h3>Summary of the Documentary Evidence</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The documentary evidence introduced by the ODC at the hearing included respondent's indictment, a
  minute entry in the criminal case reflecting the jury's verdict as to each count of the indictment, and the opinion
  of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirming respondent's conviction and sentence.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The facts underlying respondent's conviction are summarized in the Court of Appeals' opinion.
  Essentially, respondent, along with his father, Edwin Edwards, the former governor of Louisiana, and three of their
  associates were convicted for their roles in five separate schemes to profit from Louisiana's riverboat gaming
  license process by exploiting the former governor's apparent ability to influence that process. The government
  alleged that each of the defendants was a member of a conspiracy to violate RICO and that the conspirators extorted
  money from various individuals who sought approval of riverboat casino projects. They promised to help these
  individuals obtain licenses in exchange for money and threatened to make obtaining the licenses impossible if they
  did not pay. The government also alleged that the conspirators attempted to launder the money obtained through the
  schemes. United States v. Edwards, 303 F.3d 606, 610-11 (5 th Cir. 2002).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Court of Appeals determined the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that respondent
  played a major role in three of the five schemes in question. In the "Players Scheme," respondent extorted Players
  Casino by demanding that Players retain him as a lawyer and hire his merchandising firm as a consultant in exchange
  for a license and other benefits. Between May 1993 and approximately February 1995, Players paid respondent and one
  of his associates more than one million dollars. Respondent was also involved in the extortion of Robert Guidry in
  connection with the licensing of the Treasure Chest Casino. Over a three-year period beginning in April 1994,
  respondent, his father, and one of their associates received more than one million dollars in the "Treasure Chest
  Scheme." Finally, in the "15 th Riverboat License Scheme," so named because it was the final license to be awarded by
  the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, respondent and his father extorted $400,000 from Eddie DeBartolo, Jr., then the
  owner of the San Francisco 49ers professional football team. Id.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">At sentencing, the district court concluded that the loss attributable to respondent was
  $4,117,000, resulting in an upward adjustment of 13 levels under the sentencing guidelines. Of the total amount,
  $2,217,000 was attributed to the Players Scheme (including $180,000 in legal fees paid to respondent), $1.5 million
  was attributed to the Treasure Chest Scheme, and $400,000 was attributed to the 15 th Riverboat License Scheme.
  Furthermore, the district court entered an order of forfeiture in the amount of $1.8 million (the amount found by the
  jury to be the proceeds of racketeering activity), for which respondent is jointly and severally liable as a member
  of the racketeering conspiracy. See id. at 643-44. The Court of Appeals concluded these findings are also supported
  by the record. Id.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2003-07-03_00-DB-088.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee determined the ODC proved by clear and convincing evidence that respondent
  was convicted of a serious crime in violation of Rule <span class="allegedrules">8.4</span> of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct. The committee found respondent intentionally violated a duty to the public and as a
  professional, and that his conduct resulted in substantial injury to the legal profession. The baseline sanction for
  respondent's misconduct is disbarment. The committee recognized a number of aggravating factors, including
  respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of
  misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the
  victim</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span> (admitted 1981).
  Furthermore, the committee acknowledged that the mitigating factors present in this case include the
  <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">respondent's
  character and reputation</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>. Nevertheless, the committee concluded
  that under the facts presented, the mitigating circumstances are not of sufficient weight to detract from the
  "elaborate, widespread, deeply-rooted extortion and political corruption scheme" in which respondent so willingly
  participated. In particular, the committee explained:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Respondent's duplicity, acting as an attorney in most of these endeavors, involved numerous victims and many
    millions of dollars. Not only did he take advantage of the influence of his father, who was the Governor of the
    State of Louisiana, he also apparently used his knowledge and experience as a licensed attorney in order to devise
    the schemes which succeeded in the extortion of significant amounts of money for his, and his co-conspirator's,
    personal benefit. Considering the specificity of the acts, the extent of the planning involved in these
    conspiracies, as well as the magnitude of the funds that were extorted, it is unconscionable to consider the
    possibility that Respondent should not be permanently disbarred.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee recognized that respondent's actions do not fall precisely within this court's
  permanent disbarment guidelines. However, the committee concluded that respondent's conduct is so egregious that he
  should no longer have the privilege of practicing law in this state. Accordingly, the committee recommended he be
  permanently disbarred.<a name="fnref4" class="fn" href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an objection to the sanction recommended by the hearing committee. The ODC
  concurred in the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-01-30_00-DB-088.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board found the record supports the committee's finding that respondent has been
  convicted of a serious crime warranting discipline. It determined respondent damaged his clients by using his status
  as an attorney as a tool in his extortion scheme, noting respondent convinced potential gaming licensees to hire him
  as a lawyer in order to buy his corrupt influence. The board further found that respondent "intentionally engaged in
  a scheme of political corruption for monetary gain," and "lined his own pockets and the pockets of his cronies" to
  the detriment of the citizens of this state. It concluded the profession was damaged by respondent's actions, which
  were highly publicized during the criminal proceedings. Thus, the board found the baseline sanction for respondent's
  misconduct is clearly disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board adopted the aggravating and mitigating factors found by the hearing committee.
  Considering the weight of the aggravating factors and the nature of the misconduct at issue, the board then turned to
  a discussion of the sanction of permanent disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board rejected respondent's argument that permanent disbarment is not appropriate in this
  case because his conduct does not fit any of the guidelines set forth in Appendix E to Supreme Court Rule XIX. The
  board pointed out that the permanent disbarment guidelines are merely illustrative and were not intended to bind the
  court in its decision making. The board also dismissed respondent's argument that permanent disbarment cannot be
  applied to him because that sanction did not exist at the time of his conviction. Concluding respondent's criminal
  conduct is so serious that he should be forever prohibited from seeking readmission to the practice of law, the board
  recommended the imposition of permanent disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation. Accordingly, the case
  was docketed for oral argument pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(G)(1)(b).</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). When the disciplinary proceedings involve an attorney who has been convicted of a crime, the conviction is
  conclusive evidence of guilt and the sole issue presented is whether respondent's crimes warrant discipline, and if
  so, the extent thereof. Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 19(E); <span class="cite">In re: Boudreau, 02-0007 (La. 4/12/02),
  <a href="2002-04-12_2002-0007.htm">815 So. 2d 76</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v.
  Wilkinson, <a href="1990-06-04_1989-2016.htm">562 So. 2d 902</a> (La. 1990)</span>. The discipline to be imposed
  depends on the seriousness of the offense and the extent of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Perez, <a href="1989-10-23_1987-1967.htm">550 So. 2d 188</a> (La.
  1989)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent does not dispute that he has been convicted of serious crimes involving racketeering,
  extortion, and money laundering, and he concedes that disbarment is a proper sanction for such conduct. Accordingly,
  the sole issue presented for our consideration is whether respondent's offenses are so egregious that he should be
  permanently prohibited from applying for readmission to the bar.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent argues to this court that he cannot be permanently disbarred because his conviction
  does not fall within the parameters of the permanent disbarment guidelines set forth in Appendix E to the Rules for
  Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement. However, respondent ignores the preamble to Appendix E, in which we explicitly
  provided that the guidelines are illustrative in nature and are not intended to bind this court in its
  decision-making process.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <span class="cite">In re: Kirchberg, 03-0957 (La. 9/26/03),
  <a href="2003-09-26_2003-0957.htm">856 So. 2d 1162</a></span>, we rejected a lawyer's argument that his conviction
  for mail fraud arising out of a runner-based solicitation scheme did not fall within Guideline 6, which applies to
  insurance fraud, "including but not limited to staged accidents or widespread runner-based solicitation." In doing
  so, we explained that "in assessing discipline in the case of an attorney who has been convicted of a crime, we have
  often looked beyond the title of the offense to the facts of the conviction to determine the appropriate
  sanction."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the same way, it is clear respondent's actions are the very type of conduct we sought to
  address when we codified permanent disbarment as an available sanction for attorney misconduct. Respondent's
  conviction of crimes involving extortion and racketeering in connection with an extensive scheme designed to derive
  an illegal profit from Louisiana's riverboat gaming license process convincingly demonstrates that he lacks the
  fundamental honesty and fitness to practice law in this state. Rather than upholding the law, a duty that is
  incumbent upon all members of the bar, respondent knowingly and intentionally extorted and defrauded riverboat
  applicants by soliciting money and other payments, often disguised as attorney's fees, in exchange for which he
  offered to wield his corrupt influence to improperly manipulate the application process. The actions of respondent,
  which were covered extensively in the media, caused incalculable harm to the good reputation of the legal profession
  in Louisiana.<a name="fnref5" class="fn" href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a> Moreover, his misconduct struck at the integrity of state
  government and caused actual harm to every citizen of this state. Quite simply, the sheer magnitude of his misconduct
  is without parallel.<a name="fnref6" class="fn" href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, we would plainly fail in our constitutional duty to regulate the
  practice of law and protect the public if we were to impose any sanction less than permanent disbarment. Accordingly,
  respondent must be permanently disbarred.<a name="fnref7" class="fn" href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is ordered that the name of Stephen Randolph Edwards,
  Louisiana Bar Roll number 5295, be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the
  State of Louisiana be revoked. Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered that respondent be
  permanently prohibited from being readmitted to the practice of law in this state. All costs and expenses in the
  matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to
  commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid</p>

  6/29/00), 765 So. 2d 327</span>.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">2</a> A 34-count superseding indictment was returned by
  the grand jury on August 4, 1999; however, it does not appear that a copy of the superseding indictment is contained
  in the record before us.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3" id="fn3">3</a> The jury convicted respondent of Counts 1 and 2
  (RICO), 12-15 (Players Casino extortion), 16 (interstate travel in aid of racketeering), 17-19 (Treasure Chest Casino
  extortion), 20-22 and 25-27 (mail and wire fraud in connection with the awarding of the fifteenth riverboat license),
  31 (extortion in connection with the awarding of the fifteenth riverboat license), and 34 (money laundering). The
  district court later granted a new trial and dismissed the fraud convictions subject of Counts 20-22 and 25-27 in
  light of Cleveland v. United States, 531 U.S. 12 (2000) (holding that mail and wire fraud convictions cannot be based
  upon a theory that the government was defrauded of its intangible right to issue licenses).</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4" class="fn" href="#fnref4" id="fn4">4</a> One member of the committee dissented as to the
  sanction, concluding that respondent's conduct warrants disbarment, but not permanent disbarment.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5" class="fn" href="#fnref5" id="fn5">5</a> Alluding to the publicity this case has received,
  respondent suggests that the board's recommendation of permanent disbarment is premised at least in part on his
  status as the son of a prominent four-term governor of the state, and argues he should not be treated more harshly
  than other members of the bar simply because "his name is Stephen Edwards instead of Stephen Smith." We find this
  argument is completely without evidentiary support and is an insult to the integrity of the disciplinary system as
  well as this court. To some extent, respondent's status as the son of former Governor Edwards put him in a unique
  position to accomplish the extortion of which he was ultimately convicted. However, the disciplinary charges are not
  based on respondent's last name; rather, they are based on his conduct. Such conduct clearly warrants substantial
  discipline regardless of the surname of the perpetrator.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn6" class="fn" href="#fnref6" id="fn6">6</a> Respondent analogizes his case to
  <span class="cite">In re: Bankston, 01-2780 (La. 3/8/02), <a href="2002-03-08_2001-2780.htm">810 So. 2d
  1113</a></span>, in which this court imposed "ordinary" disbarment, as opposed to permanent disbarment, on a lawyer
  who accepted a bribe while serving as a state senator. However, Bankston is clearly distinguishable from the instant
  case. In contrast to the extensive extortion scheme in the instant case, which involved improper payments totaling
  millions of dollars, Bankston involved a single act of bribery in the form of a $1,555.01 payment for a sham rental
  of the lawyer's condominium. Although we in no way minimize the seriousness of the misconduct in Bankston, it
  obviously pales in comparison to the unprecedented extortion scheme engaged in by respondent and his co-defendants in
  the instant case.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn7" class="fn" href="#fnref7" id="fn7">7</a> It is of no moment that respondent's misconduct
  and resulting conviction occurred prior to the adoption of the amendments to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10(A) and §
  24(A) which provide for permanent disbarment. These amendments do not represent a substantive change to the bar
  disciplinary rules, nor do they result in the adoption of a new sanction which did not previously exist. Rather,
  these amendments simply represent a procedural change to Supreme Court Rule XIX in order to recognize a power this
  court has always possessed. <span class="cite">In re: Laudumiey &amp; Mann, 03-0234 (La. 6/27/03),
