  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 01-DB-008</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a petition for consent discipline by
  Rose M. Lain ("Respondent") of New Orleans, Louisiana, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of
  Louisiana, but currently suspended.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" class="fn" id="_ednref1">[i]</a>  For reasons
  stated below, the Disciplinary Board accepts the petition and orders a public reprimand be issued against
  Respondent.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On January 17, 2001, Respondent filed a petition for consent discipline, wherein she admitted to
  violating Rule <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct<a href="#_edn2"
  name="_ednref2" class="fn" id="_ednref2">[ii]</a> by her failure to properly withdraw from her representation of a
  client, leaving the court to believe the client was still represented by Respondent. Respondent proposes that as a
  result of this violation she be publicly reprimanded. On March 30, 2001, ODC filed its concurrence in the petition
  and a memorandum in support of the proposed sanction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> On May 24, 2001, a panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter.  The parties waived
  their appearances before the Board; therefore, no oral argument was conducted.</p>

  <h2>STIPULATION OF FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The pertinent portion of the stipulation of facts filed by the Respondent provide as
  follows:<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" class="fn" id="_ednref3">[iii]</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal">"[Respondent] was hired in 1997 by Ms. Helen Williams to have Ms. Williams appointed
    administratrix of her son's estate at a cost of $1,923.00. After accomplishing what she was asked, [Respondent]
    believed that she was finished with the case. However, [Respondent] was still listed in the [c]ourt record as
    attorney for the estate and Ms. Williams believed that she was still being represented by [Respondent].</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">[Respondent] failed to properly withdraw from Ms. Williams' case leaving the [c]ourt and
    opposing counsel, as well as her client, to believe she was still counsel of record. Failing to withdraw caused
    [Respondent] to be responsible for discovery and court appearances relative to the case. [Respondent] failed to
    abide by the rules of discovery and failed to appear in [c]ourt after receiving notice because her belief was that
    she had finished her portion of the case.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" class="fn" id="_ednref4">[iv]</a> Neither
    the client nor the other parties in the case were aware that [Respondent] was no longer working on the case as she
    did not formally withdraw."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rule
  <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  The Board must accept that
  Respondent has violated this rule.  <span class="cite"><i>In re Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96);
  <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given the violations of these rules, the Board is
  left to determine if the proposed sanction of public reprimand is appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The record in this matter supports a finding that Respondent negligently violated duties owed to
  her client, the legal system and the profession. While the record fails to provide any evidence of actual harm
  suffered by her client, the potential for injury always exists when an attorney fails to properly withdraw from
  representation.  Further, Respondent's failure to appear in court disrupted the orderly flow of court proceedings and
  reflected poorly on the profession.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board finds that the following aggravating factors are present in this matter: 1)
  <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary record</span>,<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" class="fn"
  id="_ednref5">[v]</a> 2) <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of victim</span>,<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6"
  class="fn" id="_ednref6">[vi]</a> and 3) <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of
  law</span>.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" class="fn" id="_ednref7">[vii]</a>  The Board also finds that the
  following mitigating factors are present: 1) <span class="ABAstandard">absence of dishonest or selfish motive</span>,
  2) <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span> and 3) <span class="ABAstandard">cooperative attitude towards the
  disciplinary proceedings</span>.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" class="fn" id="_ednref8">[viii]</a></p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <h3>I. ABA Standards</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanction</i>
  (herein "Standard") to determine the baseline sanction by determining "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's mental
  state and the extent of the injury caused; and then adjust[ing] the sanction in accordance with the aggravating and
  mitigating factors present."  <span class="cite"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94);
  <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 350</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The proposed sanction is in line with the ABA guidelines.  Under A.B.A. Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">7.3</span>, a "reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer negligently engages in
  conduct that is a violation of a duty owed to the profession, and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the
  public, or the legal system."</p>

  <h3>II. Relevant Case Law</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">While the Board also looks to relevant case law for assistance in determining an appropriate
  sanction for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, prior decisions involving imposition of a public
  reprimand for an attorney's improper termination of representation almost without fail include a failure to return an
  unearned fee.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" class="fn" id="_ednref9">[ix]</a> No such allegation is present in this
  matter. Additionally, those prior decisions also include additional rule violations. Based upon the stipulation of
  facts, no additional rule violations are present in this matter.  Accordingly, a public reprimand adequately
  addresses the misconduct at issue.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the petition for consent discipline be accepted, and
  that a public reprimand be issued against the Respondent, Rose M. Lain.  The Board further orders that Respondent be
  assessed the costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the
  date of finality of this Ruling until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" class="fn" id="_edn1">[i]</a> Respondent was suspended for a
  two-year period effective June 9, 2000, for failure to properly protect third-party funds, misrepresentation to a
  bankruptcy court, failure to diligently represent her client, failure to have a labeled trust account, and failure to
  fully cooperate with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. <span class="cite"><i>In re Lain</i>, 2000-0148 (La.
  5/26/00); <a href="../SC/2000-05-26_2000-0148.htm">760 So. 2d 1152</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2" class="fn" id="_edn2">[ii]</a> Rule 1.16 is entitled
  "Declining or Terminating Representation" and provides in pertinent part:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnoteinverted">"(d) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent
    reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing
    time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and
    refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned.  The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client
    to the extent permitted by other law."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref3" name="_edn3" class="fn" id="_edn3">[iii]</a> While the parties did not
  jointly file the stipulation of facts, ODC later incorporated the stipulation of facts submitted by Respondent into
  its concurrence in the petition.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref4" name="_edn4" class="fn" id="_edn4">[iv]</a> In its memorandum in support
  of the proposed sanction, ODC states that, as a result of her failure to appear in court, Respondent was cited for
  contempt.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref5" name="_edn5" class="fn" id="_edn5">[v]</a> In addition to her current
  suspension, Respondent received an admonition in 1996 for violation of Rules 1.3, 1.15(b), and 1.16(d) of the Rules
  of Professional Conduct. Board Docket No. 96-ADB-039 (8/6/96).</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref6" name="_edn6" class="fn" id="_edn6">[vi]</a> ODC asserts that "Ms.
  Williams is an elderly lady and she suffers from illiteracy."</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref7" name="_edn7" class="fn" id="_edn7">[vii]</a> Admitted to practice in
  1987.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref8" name="_edn8" class="fn" id="_edn8">[viii]</a> In its memorandum, ODC also
  cites as a mitigating factor personal or emotional problems.  However, the record is devoid of any amplification of
  or support for a determination that this mitigating factor is present.</p>
