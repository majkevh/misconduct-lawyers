<p><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the complaints were filed, the ODC conducted an investigation.&nbsp; Subsequently, the ODC instituted formal charges against respondent.&nbsp; He failed to file an answer to the charges.&nbsp; As a result, pursuant to </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s11'></a><font size="3"> no formal hearing was held, but the parties were allowed to </font></p>
<p><font size="3">present documentary evidence on the issue of sanctions.&nbsp; The ODC submitted its evidence and sought disbarment.&nbsp; Respondent failed to present any evidence.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thereafter, the <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Add60?an=JD_HC9773 --##'>hearing committee</a> filed its report.&nbsp; Relying on the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the committee determined the baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct was disbarment.</font><font size="1"> 2</font><font size="3">&nbsp; The committee found no mitigating factors justifying a more lenient sanction.&nbsp; However, the board recognized the presence of several aggravating factors:&nbsp; prior discipline</font><span class="CITE">,<font size="1"> 3</font><font size="3">&nbsp; </font></span>pattern of misconduct, dishonest or selfish motive, multiple offenses and bad faith obstruction of a disciplinary proceeding.&nbsp; Further, the committee noted respondent continues to hold himself out to the public as an attorney and represent clients before the courts of the State of Louisiana while on suspension.&nbsp; Accordingly, the committee recommended disbarment.</p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subsequently, the <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A94ae?an=JD_97-DB-073 --##'>disciplinary board </a>issued its recommendation to this court, in which it concurred in the findings of the hearing committee.&nbsp; In addition to the aggravating factors cited by the committee, it further recognized the presence of the additional factors of substantial experience in the practice of law, indifference to making restitution and refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of the conduct.</font><font size="1"> 4</font><font size="3">&nbsp; Based on these findings, the board recommended that respondent be disbarred from practice.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the recommendation of the disciplinary board.</font></p>
<p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The record supports the finding that respondent violated the professional rules as charged.&nbsp; In addition the numerous instances of respondent's commingling and conversion of client funds and neglect of legal matters, it is particularly disturbing that respondent continued to practice law when he was clearly aware he was ineligible to do so.&nbsp; Such conduct reveals a blatant disregard for the authority of this court, and demonstrates respondent lacks the moral fitness to practice law.&nbsp; Accordingly, the only appropriate sanction in this case is </font>disbarment.</p>
<p><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that the name of Eddie L. Stephens be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked.&nbsp; All costs in this matter are assessed against respondent with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of the finality of this court's judgment until paid.</font></p>
<p class='footnotetitle'>FOOTNOTES:<br>
</p>
<p class='footnote'><font size="1">1</font><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent was suspended from the practice of law for a period of eighteen </font>months in <b><i>In Re:&nbsp; Stephens</i></b>, 94-1924 (La.11/18/94), 645 So.2d 1133.&nbsp;&nbsp; This suspension was ordered to run consecutively from an earlier suspension imposed </p>
<p class='footnote'>in <b><i>In Re:&nbsp; Stephens</i></b>, 624 So.2d 903 (La.1993), which respondent began serving on October 1, 1993.&nbsp; Respondent never sought reinstatement from the 1994 suspension and therefore has remained ineligible to practice since October 1, 1993.<br>
</p>
<p class='footnote'><font size="1">2</font><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee relied on the following ABA Standards:&nbsp; 4.11 (disbarment </font>appropriate when lawyer knowingly converts client property and causes injury or potential injury to a client);&nbsp; 4.41 (disbarment appropriate when lawyer </p>
<p class='footnote'>knowingly fails to perform services for a client or engages in a pattern of neglect with respect to client matters, causing serious or potentially serious injury to a client);&nbsp; 5.11(b) (disbarment appropriate when lawyer engages in any other intentional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation);&nbsp; 6.21 (disbarment appropriate when a lawyer knowingly </p>
<p class='footnote'>violates a court order);&nbsp; 7.1 (disbarment appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed to the profession);&nbsp; 8.1 (disbarment appropriate when lawyer intentionally or knowingly violates the </p>
<p class='footnote'>terms of a prior disciplinary order or has been suspended for the same or similar misconduct, and intentionally or knowingly engages in further similar acts of misconduct that cause injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession).<br>

</p>
<p class='footnote'><font size="1">4</font><font size="3">&nbsp; While not part of the complaints, the disciplinary board recognized the </font>record included a copy of a deposition of respondent's brother taken on April 21, 1997 at a Baton Rouge law office.&nbsp; Respondent participated in the deposition and represented his brother in connection with a homeowner's insurance claim against an insurance company.&nbsp; The board concluded the exhibit was &quot;another example of respondent's continued practice of law while on suspension and his flagrant disregard for the rules of the profession.&quot;</p>
