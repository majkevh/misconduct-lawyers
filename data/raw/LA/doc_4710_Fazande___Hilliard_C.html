  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from two counts of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Hilliard C. Fazande, II, an attorney licensed to practice law in
  Louisiana.<a name="_ftnref1" class="fn" href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

  <h2 >UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <h3 >Count I - Batiste Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy" >In July 1996, John Batiste, Jr., retained respondent to institute an action
  against the Department of the Army.<a name="_ftnref2" class="fn" href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>  Respondent
  filed suit on behalf of Mr. Batiste against the Secretary of the Department of the Army and others in the United
  States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.  In March 1997, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss
  or, alternatively, a motion for summary judgment.  Upon respondent's motion, the court continued the hearing for two
  weeks so as to give respondent time to file an opposition.  Respondent failed to submit a timely opposition.  By
  minute entry dated April 23, 1997, the court granted the defendants' motion and dismissed Mr. Batiste's suit. 
  Respondent did not move for reconsideration or file an appeal.  Mr. Batiste discharged respondent on June 23, 1998
  and filed a legal malpractice action against respondent on July 28, 1999.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The facts are disputed with regard to events which occurred between the dismissal of the suit and
  the discharge of respondent by Mr. Batiste.  Respondent testified at the formal hearing that he realized at the time
  of the dismissal that he believed he filed the petition in the wrong court and needed to file in the Court of Claims
  in Washington D.C.  He contended that he advised Mr. Batiste of the dismissal approximately one week after it
  occurred and discussed the need to file in the new venue.  Respondent testified he obtained information on the
  appropriate procedure to file in the Court of Claims and met with his client after receiving the information.  Based
  on the information he received, respondent  believed he had four years (until the summer of 2001) to file the action
  in the Court of Claims.  As a result, he simply conducted periodic legal research for the first year following the
  dismissal and tried to become familiar with the procedures in the Court of Claims.  Respondent testified Mr. Batiste
  discharged him in June 1998, without giving him the opportunity to file the suit in the new venue.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In contrast, Mr. Batiste testified that respondent did not advise him of the dismissal of his
  suit, and that he did not learn of the dismissal until June 1998, one year after the case had been dismissed.  Upon
  learning of the dismissal, Mr. Batiste testified he discharged respondent by letter dated June 23, 1998 based on
  neglect.  Additionally, he sent a letter in proper person to the trial court advising the court he was unaware of the
  dismissal and urging the court to "reopen" his case.<a name="_ftnref3" class="fn" href="#_ftn3"
  id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>  Mr. Batiste also testified he filed a complaint with the ODC advising of respondent's neglect
  of his legal matter and failure to communicate, filed a legal malpractice suit in proper person against respondent
  and retained new counsel to pursue his case against the Department of the Army.</p>

  <h3>Count II - Jackson/Davis Matters</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On February 13, 1998, Bernadette Jackson and her children, 21-year old Patrick Davis and 12 -year
  old Monica Davis, were involved in an automobile accident.  Six days later, they retained respondent to represent
  their interests and pursue their personal injury claims.  Initially, respondent communicated with his clients
  frequently and assured them he was protecting their interests.  However, after several months, respondent began to
  communicate with his clients less often.  Ultimately, respondent failed to file suit on behalf of his clients and
  their claims prescribed.<a name="_ftnref4" class="fn" href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Approximately one month after the case had prescribed, Ms. Jackson and Mr. Davis met with
  respondent.  Mr. Davis later testified that, at that meeting, respondent "apologized and everything, saying that he
  was sorry that he didn't file and all this and [then] he said it would come out of his pocket for like whatever it
  was that he was supposed to do. . ." </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">At this point, it is unclear whether respondent orally advised his clients to seek outside
  counsel to discuss their potential malpractice claims against him, but it is undisputed that respondent did not
  subsequently advise his clients in writing to do so.  In any event, respondent's clients, on their own, consulted
  Harold Bartholomew, Ms. Jackson's friend and fellow board member on New Orleans Legal Assistance Corporation
  ("NOLAC").<a name="_ftnref5" class="fn" href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>  Eventually, respondent settled his
  professional liability directly with Mr. Davis with the consent of Mr. Bartholomew.<a name="_ftnref6" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In May 1999, Ms. Jackson filed a disciplinary complaint with the ODC on her own behalf and that
  of her minor daughter.  Mr. Davis instituted a separate complaint with the ODC.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Following its investigation, the ODC filed two counts of formal charges against respondent.  As
  to the Batiste matter, the ODC alleged violations of Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (lack of
  diligence), <span class="allegedrules">1.4(a)</span> (failure to keep client reasonably informed about the status of
  legal matter and failure to comply with reasonable requests for information),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct) and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct.  As to the Jackson/Davis matter, the ODC alleged respondent's conduct violated Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (lack of diligence), <span class="allegedrules">1.4(a)</span> (failure to
  keep client reasonably informed about the status of legal matter and failure to comply with reasonable requests for
  information) and <span class="allegedrules">1.8(h)</span> (making an agreement prospectively limiting lawyer's
  malpractice liability).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an answer denying the allegations of misconduct, reiterating his defenses raised
  in connection with the investigations of the complaints.  Accordingly, the matter was scheduled for a formal hearing
  before the committee. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">At the hearing, the complainants testified on behalf of the ODC.  Respondent was present at the
  hearing and testified on his own behalf.</p>

  <h3><span class="CITE"><a href="../HC/2002-07-19_00-DB-152.htm">Recommendation of the Hearing
  Committee</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As to the Batiste matter, the committee found respondent failed to promptly notify Mr. Batiste
  that his complaint had been dismissed, failed to quickly pursue the filing in the Court of Claims and failed to
  notify his client of options available to him to further pursue his legal matter.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Regarding the Jackson/Davis matter, the committee concluded respondent failed to provide his
  clients with specific information regarding any action he was taking on their case, and permitted their claims to
  prescribe due to respondent's failure to obtain the necessary documentation to pursue them.  The committee pointed
  out Ms. Jackson and Mr. Davis did ultimately obtain independent counsel on their own volition prior to Mr. Davis
  entering into an agreement to settle with respondent for his malpractice.  Nevertheless, it found respondent
  attempted to settle his legal malpractice claims without advising them in writing that they should seek independent
  counsel.<a name="_ftnref7" class="fn" href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these factual findings, the committee concluded respondent violated Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4</span> and <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> in the Batiste
  and Jackson/Davis matters by neglecting his clients' legal matters and failing to communicate with them.  It also
  determined there was a "<i>de minimis</i> violation" of Rule 1.8(h) in the Jackson/Davis matter based on respondent's
  failure to advise in writing Ms. Jackson and Mr. Davis to seek independent counsel prior to attempting to settle his
  legal malpractice. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee found respondent knowingly violated duties owed to his clients, and that his
  failure to diligently pursue his clients' legal matters and to communicate with them resulted in actual injury.  It
  determined Mr. Batiste suffered actual harm as a result of the unnecessary delay of his legal matter caused by
  respondent's actions, as well as the expense of having to retain new counsel.  Further, the committee recognized
  that, although respondent settled his malpractice liability with Mr. Davis, the record indicated Ms. Jackson and her
  daughter had suffered some damages, albeit a minimal amount.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, the committee found several aggravating factors:
  respondent's prior disciplinary record for similar misconduct,<a name="_ftnref8" class="fn" href="#_ftn8"
  id="_ftnref8">[8]</a> substantial legal experience,<a name="_ftnref9" class="fn" href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a>
  pattern of misconduct and multiple offenses.  The only mitigating factor recognized was respondent's cooperative
  attitude toward the proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Citing the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, the committee found a one-year
  suspension to be appropriate under the facts.  Relying on the existence of respondent's prior disciplinary offenses,
  the committee determined that no portion of the suspension should be deferred. </p>

  <h3><span class="CITE"><a href="../DB/2003-08-01_00-DB-152.htm">Recommendation of the Disciplinary
  Board</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board adopted the factual findings of the hearing committee.  However, the board
  disagreed with the committee's legal finding that respondent's actions in the Jackson/Davis matter violated Rule
  1.8(h), which prohibits the settling of such a claim unless the client has been advised in writing that independent
  representation is appropriate.<a name="_ftnref10" class="fn" href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a>  The board noted
  that the committee correctly found, and there is no dispute, that Mr. Davis was represented by Mr. Bartholomew at the
  time the settlement was reached.  Because Mr. Davis was represented at the time, the board concluded respondent did
  not violate Rule 1.8(h).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In determining the sanction for respondent's misconduct, the board found that some of
  respondent's conduct was knowing, such as his failure to adequately communicate with Ms. Jackson and Mr. Davis. 
  However, it observed the damage caused by respondent appeared to be minimal.  In the Batiste matter, it noted Mr.
  Batiste was able to locate another attorney to pursue his lawsuit in the Court of Claims.  In the Jackson/Davis
  matter, it concluded that, although respondent allowed his clients' actions to prescribe, they suffered little harm. 
  In support, it pointed out Mr. Davis entered into a monetary settlement with respondent, and the record indicated
  that the value of the claims of Ms. Jackson and her daughter were "minimal."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board adopted the aggravating and mitigating factors cited by the committee, as well as found
  the mitigating factor of absence of dishonest or selfish motive.  Further, while it pointed out respondent had a
  prior disciplinary record, it also noted that a considerable amount of time has passed since respondent's prior
  misconduct.  Relying on jurisprudence from this court, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the
  practice of law for a period of six months, with three months deferred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed an objection to the board's recommendation.  Accordingly, the matter was docketed
  for briefing and argument in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 11(G).</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court.  La. Const. art. V,
  &sect; 5(B).  Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence.  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Quaid</i>,
  94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana
  State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall</i>, 597 So. 2d  444 (La. 1992)</span>.  While we are not bound in any way by the findings
  and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error standard is
  applicable to the committee's factual findings.  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Caulfield</i>,  96-1401 (La. 11/25/96),
  <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La.
  3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The record clearly supports the hearing committee's finding that respondent's actions in the
  Batiste and Jackson/Davis matters violated Rules 1.3 and 1.4.  In both instances, respondent failed to communicate
  with his clients about the status of their cases and neglected their cases.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Like the board, however, we find legal error in the hearing committee's conclusion that
  respondent's actions in the Jackson/Davis matter violated Rule 1.8(h).  There is not much jurisprudence from this
  court interpreting Rule 1.8(h).  A review of this provision indicates it contains two distinct sections.  In the
  first section, the rule prohibits a lawyer from making an agreement "prospectively limiting the lawyer's liability to
  a client for malpractice unless permitted by law and the client is independently represented in making the
  agreement."  The prospective agreement contemplated by this section of the rule refers to an agreement made at the
  beginning of the representation, such as a hold harmless clause.  See ABA/BNA's Lawyer's Manual on Professional
  Conduct  &sect; 51:1104.  Clearly, this section of the rule is not implicated in the instant case.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The second section of the rule prohibits a lawyer from settling a malpractice claim with an
  unrepresented client or former client "without first advising that person in writing that independent representation
  is appropriate in connection therewith."  The language used in this section of the rule suggests the requirement of
  written notice is triggered upon the actual settlement of the malpractice liability, as opposed to mere negotiations
  toward a settlement.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the instant case, respondent's discussions with Mr. Davis and Ms. Jackson arguably constituted
  the earliest stages of a negotiation toward a settlement, but more likely consisted of an admission of fault and a
  willingness to pay compensation.  There was no discussion of a dollar amount for settlement purposes.  The
  discussions never progressed to the point of a formal offer of settlement by respondent, nor was there acceptance of
  any offer by his clients.  Under these circumstances, we conclude the requirement of Rule 1.8(h), that respondent
  advise his clients in writing that independent counsel is appropriate, was never triggered.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found violations of Rules 1.3 and 1.4, we now turn to consideration of an appropriate
  sanction.  In doing so, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of
  conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. 
  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a>
  (La. 1987)</span>.  The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the
  offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. 
  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d
  520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The baseline sanction for misconduct involving multiple instances of neglect and failure to
  communicate is generally a suspension, which is sometimes deferred in part.  <i>See <span class="CITE">In re:
  Jackson</span></i><span class="CITE">, 02-2764 (La. 4/9/03), <a href="2003-04-09_2002-2764.htm">842 So. 2d
  359</a></span> (six-month suspension imposed on attorney who neglected and permitted two clients' cases to
  prescribe); <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Whitehead,</i> 01-3071 (La. 4/12/02), <a href="2002-04-21_2001-3071.htm">816
  So. 2d 284</a></span> (one-year suspension, with six months deferred, subject to a six-month probation, imposed on an
  attorney with a minor prior disciplinary record who neglected three client matters, failed to communicate with the
  three clients, failed to refund unearned fees to two clients and failed to cooperate with the ODC in two
  investigations<i>); <span class="CITE">In re: Holley,</span></i> <span class="CITE">01-1876 (La. 10/5/01),
  <a href="2001-11-05_2001-1876.htm">797 So. 2d 46</a></span> (six-month suspension, with all but sixty days deferred,
  subject to a one-year period of probation imposed on an attorney who neglected three legal matters, negligently
  failed to communicate with the clients and negligently failed to refund unearned fees, but provided restitution prior
  to the complaints being filed);<i>  <span class="CITE">In re: Colwart</span></i><span class="CITE">, 98-2303 (La.
  11/6/98), <a href="1998-11-16_1998-2303.htm">721 So. 2d 848</a></span> (six-month suspension imposed on an attorney
  with a prior disciplinary record who failed to communicate with a client, failed to return unearned fees for one year
  and failed to cooperate with the ODC)<i>.</i></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, we recognize respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary
  record</span> (although we find his prior suspension is fairly remote in time), <span class="ABAstandard">substantial
  legal experience</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span> and
  <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>.  As mitigating factors, we find respondent has demonstrated a
  <span class="ABAstandard">cooperative attitude toward the proceedings</span> and <span class="ABAstandard">did not
  act with  a dishonest or selfish motive</span>.  Additionally, we note respondent made a
  <span class="ABAstandard">prompt effort to rectify the consequences of his misconduct</span> in the Jackson/Davis
  matter and intended to take action to protect his client's interests in the Batiste matter, but was discharged before
  he could do so.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, we find the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct is a
  suspension from the practice of law for six months, with three months deferred, followed by one-year period of
  probation.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is ordered that Hilliard C. Fazande, II, Louisiana Bar Roll
  number 9953, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months.  Three months of the suspension shall
  be deferred, and respondent shall be placed on unsupervised probation for a period of one year.  All costs and
  expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10.1, with legal
  interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn1" class="fn" href="#_ftnref1" id="_ftn1">[1]</a>  The original formal charges
  involved three counts of misconduct.  The hearing committee found insufficient evidence to support Count III,
  relative to respondent's alleged neglect of a legal matter.  The disciplinary board concurred in the committee's
  findings and dismissed the charge.  The ODC has not objected to the dismissal of this count; accordingly, we will not
  discuss it further.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn2" class="fn" href="#_ftnref2" id="_ftn2">[2]</a>  While serving in the Army,
  Mr. Batiste was found guilty of misconduct by a military court-martial, resulting in a reduction in rank and pay.  He
  sought to file suit against the Army to have his military record amended to show that his demotion would have been
  suspended if the convening authority had been made aware of a recommendation by the court-martial that the reduction
  in rank be suspended.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn3" class="fn" href="#_ftnref3" id="_ftn3">[3]</a>  The court construed the
  letter as a motion for relief from judgment and set the motion for hearing.  Ultimately, the court denied Mr.
  Batiste's motion, essentially on the grounds that it was untimely, but noted the proper relief for Mr. Batiste was to
  seek malpractice damages.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn4" class="fn" href="#_ftnref4" id="_ftn4">[4]</a>  According to respondent, he
  did not file the suit because his clients had failed to provide him with their medical records, despite his many
  requests.  Specifically, he contends that in December 1998, two months before the prescriptive date, he had a
  telephone conversation with Ms. Jackson and Mr. Davis instructing them to forward their medical records to him, and
  followed up by forwarding two letters by certified mail, return receipt requested.  He claims neither forwarded the
  records or responded in any regard and, based on such, assumed they abandoned their claims.  In contrast, Ms. Jackson
  and her son each testified they did not receive any correspondence from respondent, and that respondent stopped
  communicating with them several months before the case prescribed.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn6" class="fn" href="#_ftnref6" id="_ftn6">[6]</a>  Ms. Jackson and her minor
  daughter had only one medical visit resulting from the accident.  While respondent offered to settle his malpractice
  liability with them, the parties were unable to agree on an amount.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn7" class="fn" href="#_ftnref7" id="_ftn7">[7]</a>  Notably, the committee stated
  that the evidence at the hearing was inadequate to allow the committee to reach a definitive answer regarding whether
  respondent entered into settlement negotiations with his clients before or after they obtained independent
  representation. </p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn8" class="fn" href="#_ftnref8" id="_ftn8">[8]</a>  In 1983, we suspended
  respondent from the practice of law for a period of two and one-half years stemming from his neglect of four legal
  matters and misrepresenting facts to his clients relative to the status of their matters when they had been dismissed
  or compromised in some other respect.  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Fazande</i>,

  a formal private reprimand for filing pleadings while on suspension.  COPR #9322 (3/17/88).  He was also admonished
  in 1997 for failing to cooperate with the ODC in connection with the investigation of a disciplinary complaint.
