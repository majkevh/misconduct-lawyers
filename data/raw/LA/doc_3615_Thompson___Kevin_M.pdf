  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 98-DB-049</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of formal charges by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel against Kevin M. Thompson of Norfolk, Virginia, formerly of Metairie, Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Formal charges consisting of one count were filed against Respondent on July 17, 1998.  These
  charges alleged that Respondent violated Rules of Professional Conduct <span class="allegedrules">1.1(a)</span>,
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span>, <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span>, and
  <span class="allegedrules">1.16(b)</span>(d).  Respondent was served with the charges on October 7, 1998.  Respondent
  did not file an answer to the formal charges.  Consequently, on November 10, 1998, the ODC filed a motion to declare
  factual allegations deemed proven and to schedule written arguments. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" class="fn"
  id="_ednref1">[i]</a>  This motion was granted by the hearing committee chair, Arthur Kingsmill, on November 28,
  1998.  No motion to recall the order and/or to be heard in mitigation was requested by the Respondent.  The ODC then
  filed its deemed admitted submission on sanctions and the exhibits attached thereto.  No written submission was filed
  by the Respondent.  The hearing committee's report, which addressed only the issue of the appropriate sanction, was
  issued on May 24, 1999.  It recommended that the Respondent be publicly reprimanded for violations of Rules of
  Professional Conduct 1.4(a) and 1.16(d).<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn" id="_ednref2">[ii]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">A panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter on July 29, 1999.  Respondent did not
  appear at the hearing.  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel was represented by Deputy Counsel G. Fred Ours.</p>

  <h3>FORMAL CHARGES</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The original charges consist of one count.   This count alleges that the Respondent was retained
  to represent the interests of Edwin Dixon in the succession of Martha Frowner Polk.  Ms. Polk lived in open
  concubinage with Mr. Dixon prior to her death.  On May 13, 1992, a partial judgment of possession, reserving the
  succession's right to pursue the immovable property interest, was signed, and the succession filed a petition for
  possession involving the immovable property in which Mr. Dixon lived and claimed an ownership interest.  The count
  further alleges that Respondent had previously, on October 15, 1990, filed an answer and reconventional demand
  asserting Mr. Dixon's interest in the property, apparently on the erroneous belief that the succession had already
  filed the petition. <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" class="fn" id="_ednref3">[iii]</a>  Respondent failed to either
  act on his client's behalf, or to withdraw from the representation, and subsequently left the active practice of law
  without advising his client and returning his file to him.  The file has subsequently been destroyed.  The
  Respondent's conduct is alleged to have violated Rules 1.1(a), 1.3, 1.4, and 1.16(b)(d) of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct.</p>

  <h2><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/1999-05-24_98-DB-049.htm">FINDINGS OF THE HEARING COMMITTEE</a></span></h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">After reviewing the ODC's deemed admitted submission on sanctions, including the exhibits
  attached thereto, the hearing committee found that Rules 1.4(a) and 1.16(d) had been violated.  The hearing committee
  noted that there were no aggravating or mitigating circumstances contained with the record.  The hearing committee
  also found that client injury or potential injury was present, even though most of the documents involving real
  estate are obtainable from the public record.  No violations of Rules 1.1(a), 1.3, 1.4(b) or 1.16(b) were found.  The
  hearing committee recommended that the Respondent be publicly reprimanded.  No objection to the hearing committee's
  report was filed by the Respondent.   The ODC filed a memorandum stating that it has no objection to and concurs with
  the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Board finds that the Respondent has violated duties owed to his client and has engaged in
  negligent conduct.  The Board concurs with the hearing committee's finding that actual client injury or potential
  injury, although minimal, exists in that Mr. Dixon's file was not returned to him.  The Board also concurs with the
  hearing committee's finding that no aggravating or mitigating circumstances exist.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Under the A.B.A. <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span>, reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent and does not act
  with reasonable diligence in representing a client, and causes injury or potential injury to a client.  Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.13</span> provides that a reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent
  in dealing with client property and causes little injury or potential injury to a client. </p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">After considering the Hearing Committee's Report, the evidence submitted by the ODC, and the
  argument presented by counsel for ODC, the Disciplinary Board agrees with the findings of the hearing committee.  The
  evidence indicates that the Respondent violated Rules of Professional Conduct <span class="Rules">1.4(a)</span> and
  <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span>.  The Disciplinary Board therefore orders that Respondent, Kevin M. Thompson, be
  issued a public reprimand and further orders that he be assessed with all costs and expenses of these
  proceedings.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" class="fn" id="_edn1">[i]</a> Pursuant to Louisiana Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, Section 11E(3), since Respondent failed to answer the formal charges, the charges were deemed
  admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2" class="fn" id="_edn2">[ii]</a> Rule 1.4 provides in
  part:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">"(a)  A lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and
    promptlycomply with requests for information."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="footnotetext">Rule 1.16  provides in part:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">"(d) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably
    practicable to protect a client's interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for
    employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client entitled and refunding any
    advance payment of fee that has not been earned.  The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent
    permitted by other law."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref3" name="_edn3" class="fn" id="_edn3">[iii]</a>  A review of the Orleans
  Parish Civil District Court record of the succession proceeding, which was submitted as an exhibit to the ODC's
  Deemed Admitted Submission on Sanctions, shows that Respondent appears to have filed this answer and reconventional
  demand in response to the "Petition to Be Appointed Administratrix, For Rule to Show Cause, For Temporary Restraining
  Order and for Preliminary and Permanent Injunctions" which had been filed by Ms. Polk's heirs in November of 1989. 
  The answer and reconventional demand does not appear to have been filed in response to the petition for possession
  which was filed in May of 1992 as asserted in the formal charges.  This information is pointed out for purposes of
  clarification only.</p>
