  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: MARVIN L. SCHWARTZ</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent is licensed to practice law in Louisiana and in New York, where he currently resides.
  In 1999, respondent submitted an application for a "no action letter" to the New York State Department of Law Real
  Estate Financing Bureau, in which he represented that there were no vacant or sublet units of any kind in a building
  he sought to convert to condominium ownership. Respondent subsequently admitted that this representation was untrue,
  and that he knew his statement was untrue at the time he made it. In 2003, respondent pleaded guilty to a violation
  of New York General Business Law § 352-c(1)(c), (4), an unclassified misdemeanor, which prohibits the use of any
  representation or statement that is false. On April 11, 2005, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate
  Division: Second Judicial Department publicly censured respondent for his professional misconduct.
  <span class="cite">In re Schwartz, 794 N.Y.S.2d 389 (2005)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Prior to the filing of formal charges against respondent in Louisiana, a joint petition for
  consent discipline was submitted by respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. The parties stipulate to
  respondent's misconduct and his subsequent misdemeanor conviction, a violation of Rule 8.4(b) of the Louisiana Rules
  of Professional Conduct. The parties seek the imposition of the same discipline in Louisiana as was imposed upon
  respondent in New York, namely a public reprimand. Having reviewed the petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Marvin L. Schwartz,
  Louisiana Bar Roll number 9906, be publicly reprimanded.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the judgment herein shall have the effect of immediately reinstating
  respondent from the interim suspension imposed in <span class="cite">In re: Schwartz, 04-0519 (La. 4/2/04),
  <a href="2004-04-02_2004-0519.htm">870 So. 2d 982</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
