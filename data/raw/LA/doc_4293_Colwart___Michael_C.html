<p><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font size="3">The record indicates that in October 1994, respondent was retained by Douglas Carter, an Angola inmate, to handle his criminal appeal.&nbsp; Although Mr. Carter's wife paid respondent a fee in the amount of $1,000, respondent performed little or not legal services on his behalf and failed to file the appeal.&nbsp; Additionally, he failed to communicate with Mr. Carter or his wife, despite their many attempts to contact him.</font></p>
<p><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In June, 1995, Mr. Carter filed a complaint with the ODC, alleging misconduct on the part of respondent and requesting assistance in obtaining a refund of the unearned fee.&nbsp; Respondent failed to comply with the ODC's requests for information, and a subpoena was issued compelling his attendance for a deposition.&nbsp; In his deposition testimony, respondent denied any misconduct.&nbsp; He stated much of the delay in his handling of the matter resulted from his inability to communicate with his client.&nbsp; In support, he submitted into evidence a copy of the letter he forwarded to Mr. Carter, dated July 18, 1995, five days after respondent's receipt of a copy of the complaint.&nbsp; While writing he was &quot;miffed&quot; over the filing of the complaint with the ODC, respondent asked his client whether he wanted the appeal proceedings to be filed or the unearned fee to be returned.&nbsp; Respondent claimed his client failed to respond to the letter.</font><span class="CITE"><font face='Times New Roman' size="1">1</font></span></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For eleven months following the deposition, Mr. Carter made numerous requests to respondent seeking the return of the unearned fee.&nbsp; Despite instructions from the ODC instructing him to pay his client, respondent did not return the fee until August 1996.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On March 24, 1997, formal charges were instituted.&nbsp; Respondent failed to file an answer, and the matter was submitted to the hearing committee on documentary evidence.&nbsp; While respondent neglected to file any evidence in the record regarding sanctions, the ODC submitted seventeen exhibits substantiating the </font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">charges and prior discipline levied against respondent.</font><span class="CITE"><font face='Times New Roman' size="1">2</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> </font></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the conclusion of the hearing, the <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Aaed6?an=JD_HC9721 --##'>hearing committee filed its report </a>with the disciplinary board, proposing respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six month<span class="CITE">.<font face='Times New Roman' size="1">3</font></span></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subsequently, the d<a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A558d?an=JD_97-DB-021 --##'>isciplinary board issued its recommendation </a>to the court concurring in the sanction suggested by the committee.&nbsp; In support, it relied on jurisprudence from this court and the presence of several aggravating factors.</font><span class="CITE"><font face='Times New Roman' size="1">4</font></span></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One board member dissented, stating he would suspend respondent from the practice of law for a period of one year and one day with &quot;heavy&quot; continuing legal education requirements for readmission, plus probation.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the recommendation of the disciplinary board.</font></p>
<p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Based on our review of the record, we conclude the sanction recommended by the disciplinary board is appropriate under the facts and consistent with the prior jurisprudence of this court.</font><span class="CITE"><font face='Times New Roman' size="1">5</font></span></p>
<p><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Aaed6?an=JD_HC9721 --##'>hearing committee</a> and disciplinary board, and the record filed herein, it is the decision of the court that the recommendation of the disciplinary board be adopted.&nbsp; Accordingly, it is ordered that respondent, Michael C. Colwart, be </font>suspended<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> from the practice of law for a </font>period of six months. <font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> All costs of these proceedings are assessed against respondent with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the finality of this judgment until paid.</font></p>
<p class='footnotetitle'>Footnotes:</p>
<p class='footnote'><font size="1">1</font><font size="3">. </font>Upon receiving a copy of the deposition from the ODC, Mr. Carter responded that he did in fact receive the letter from respondent that had been submitted into evidence, but that his copy was &quot;intentionally&quot; undated and was mailed the </p>
<p class='footnote'>day before the deposition (September 11, 1995), in an attempt to give the appearance at the deposition that respondent was attempting to timely and amicably resolve the matter with his client.</p>
<p class='footnote'><font size="1">2.</font> Respondent's prior discipline consists of the following:&nbsp; (1) reprimand (4/20/89)--neglect of legal matter;&nbsp; (2) admonition (6/5/95)--failure to cooperate with the ODC;&nbsp; (3) admonition (7/20/95)--failure to cooperate with the ODC;&nbsp; (4) admonition (8/31/95)--failure to file post-conviction application on behalf of criminal defendant, despite receiving fee.<br>
</p>
<p class='footnote'><font size="1">3</font><font size="3">.</font> In addition to the charged misconduct, the committee noted that there may have also been misconduct involving commingling of client funds.&nbsp; In support, it pointed out the two checks issued by respondent for reimbursement of the unearned fees were written on his personal account and listed his home address, not his office address.<br>
</p>
<p class='footnote'><font size="1">4</font><font size="3">. </font>While it failed to recognize any mitigating factors, the board recognized several aggravating factors:&nbsp; (1) prior discipline;&nbsp; (2) failure to cooperate;&nbsp; (3) lack of remorse;&nbsp; and (4) substantial experience in practice of law.<br>
