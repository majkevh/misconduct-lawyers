  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from formal charges instituted by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondents, Jerry Jackson Stamps and Teresa Lynn Witt-Stamps.  Respondents are
  married and currently practice law together in the State of Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>  UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondents graduated from law school in May 1998 and applied to take the Louisiana bar
  examination in the summer of 1998.  Respondents failed to pass the bar examination at that time and began preparing
  to re-take the examination in February 1999. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In October 1998, while studying for the February 1999 examination, respondents learned that
  Gabrielee Locklear, an attorney licensed to practice in North Carolina, was advertising for law school graduates or
  associates to work for him in connection with his personal injury law practice.  After several telephone
  conversations, respondents traveled to North Carolina to meet with Mr. Locklear.  Thereafter, Mr. Locklear, who knew
  respondents were not licensed to practice law in North Carolina, contacted respondents to invite them to join his
  practice.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Following this offer, respondents made additional trips to North Carolina to meet with Mr.
  Locklear.  On December 20, 1998, they signed an employment contract with Mr. Locklear, which was to be effective on
  January 2, 1999. That contract provided:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Employee is hereby hired to perform services for Employer in the capacity of an Associate</i>. In such
    practice, Employees' duties shall consist of the general practice of law consistent with the rules of law of the
    Supreme Court of North Carolina . . . [and] while employed by Employer, <i>Employees shall use their best efforts
    to provide legal counsel and service to customers</i> in the following counties . . . Employees fully and
    completely understand and accept their obligations under this Agreement . . .  During the employment term, the
    parties will enter into partnership negotiations. . . . For all services rendered by Employees hereunder, Employees
    shall receive compensation in the amount of $36,000.00 per year per Employee plus ten percent of revenue generated
    by Employees. . . . [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">On the same day they executed their employment contract with Mr. Locklear, Mr. Locklear notarized
  their applications to sit for the February 1999 Louisiana bar examination.  The application to take the bar
  examination requested information concerning their employment history over the last ten years.  Both respondents
  replied that they had been full time students during this period and did not mention their employment with Mr.
  Locklear.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Beginning in January 1999, respondents returned to North Carolina on numerous occasions and would
  stay for periods ranging from a few days to weeks.  While it is unclear exactly what functions they performed for Mr.
  Locklear during this time, the record contains several pieces of evidence concerning their activities.  In a letter
  written on Mr. Locklear's letterhead and dated March 12, 1999, Mrs. Stamps wrote to John Robinson, an insurance
  adjuster, indicating that "we have been retained by Mr. James D. Williams.  . . ."  Mrs. Stamps signed the letter,
  which contained the signature line, "Lynn Stamps, Esq. For the Firm."  In another letter, dated April 27, 1999, Mrs.
  Stamps wrote to the Sabella Chiropractic Clinic, a medical provider, again stating the firm had been retained by Mr.
  Williams.  She signed the letter above the signature line,  "Lynn Stamps, Esq."  Upon negotiation of the settlement
  of Mr. Williams' personal injury claim, the insurer adjuster issued a check on May 13, 1999 in the amount of $7,000
  made payable to Lynn Stamps as "attorney" for Mr. Williams.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The record also contains checks issued to Mr. or Mrs. Stamps during their employment with Mr.
  Locklear.  Each of the checks was endorsed by Mr. or Mrs. Stamps.  In all but one instance, the checks contain
  notations in the "memo" section indicating the funds were proceeds and/or fees from a client
  matter.<a name="_ftnref1" class="fn" href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondents remained with Mr. Locklear's firm until April 1999, at which time Mrs. Stamps passed
  the Louisiana bar examination.  Mrs. Stamps then opened her own law practice. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Mr. Stamps, who did not pass the February 1999 bar examination, applied to sit for the July 1999
  examination.  In his application to take that examination, he made no mention of his employment with Mr. Locklear.
  Eventually, Mr. Stamps was admitted to the bar in October 1999, and joined his wife's law practice.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Following respondents' departure from Mr. Locklear's firm, Mr. Stamps wrote letters to Mr.
  Locklear on behalf of himself and his wife seeking fees purportedly owed to respondents and Mr. Locklear by clients. 
  The letters implied respondents worked on client matters and were still willing to handle the North Carolina
  cases.<a name="_ftnref2" class="fn" href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> </p>

  <h3>  Disciplinary Investigation</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The North Carolina State Bar subsequently conducted a disciplinary investigation into Mr.
  Locklear's activities in that state.  In connection with that investigation, Mr. Locklear stipulated that he split
  legal fees with Mr. and Mrs. Stamps.<a name="_ftnref3" class="fn" href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> The North
  Carolina State Bar then advised the ODC that Mr. and Mrs. Stamps may have engaged in the unauthorized practice of law
  in the State of North Carolina.<a name="_ftnref4" class="fn" href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC took sworn statements from Mr. and Mrs. Stamps.  Mrs. Stamps testified that although she
  signed an employment contract with Mr. Locklear in late 1998, the contract never went into effect because Mr.
  Locklear advised her he could not pay her.  Mrs. Stamps testified she performed some "paralegal/law clerk work" for
  Mr. Locklear on occasion, but denied ever discussing cases with clients or accepting money from them.  Mr. Stamps
  likewise testified that he did not work on any legal matters from Mr. Locklear and simply assisted him in gathering
  information for a loan application.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondents. The charges
  alleged violations of Rules <span class="allegedrules">5.5(a)</span> (violating the disciplinary regulations of
  another jurisdiction through the unauthorized practice of law in that jurisdiction),
  <span class="allegedrules">5.5(b)</span> (assisting a person who is not a member of the bar in the unauthorized
  practice of law), <span class="allegedrules">8.1(a)</span> (knowingly making a false statement of material fact in
  connection with a disciplinary matter or bar admission matter), <span class="allegedrules">8.1(b)</span> (failure to
  respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions and a disciplinary authority),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or
  misrepresentation), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the
  administration of justice) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondents answered,  denying any misconduct.  They also filed an exception, asserting Louisiana
  had no jurisdiction over their actions, which occurred in another state prior to their admission to the bar in
  Louisiana, and a motion to sever their cases.  The committee chair referred the exception to the merits and denied
  the motion to sever.  The case then proceeded to a formal hearing.</p>

  <h3>Formal Hearing</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondents presented no witnesses at the hearing, nor did they testify on their own behalf,
  relying instead on their earlier sworn statements.  The ODC likewise presented no live testimony, but submitted
  testimony of its witnesses, all of whom resided outside of the state, by deposition or videotape.</p>

  <h4> Testimony of Carolin Bakewell</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">Carolin Bakewell, counsel for the North Carolina State Bar, testified it was her opinion that
  respondents had split fees with Mr. Locklear.  In support, Ms. Bakewell noted that the checks issued by Mr. Locklear
  to respondents represented exactly 50% of the attorney's fees in the respective cases.  She pointed out the North
  Carolina Disciplinary Hearing Commission specifically rejected Mr. Locklear's argument that the checks simply
  represented salary payments.</p>

  <h4>  Testimony of Billy Ray Blackwell</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">Mr. Blackwell testified that he retained respondents to handle six cases on his behalf.  Mr.
  Blackwell stated they quoted a fee of $1,500 to him to handle his legal matters and that he paid Mrs. Stamps $700,
  and later paid an additional $400.  He claimed he consulted with both Mrs. Stamps and Mr. Stamps on numerous
  occasions.  Mr. Blackwell pointed out that Mr. Stamps had "a plaque on the desk saying 'fifty dollar ($50)
  consultation fee.'" He further testified: "I think I paid'em fifty dollars ($50) a couple of times, because they
  wouldn't even talk to you unless you paid a consultation fee. . . ."  He noted that he never received receipts for
  the payments.  Mr. Blackwell testified that he filed a complaint with the North Carolina State Bar when he concluded
  that work was never done on his cases.  Further, he maintained he was never advised by respondents that they were not
  licensed to practice law in North Carolina.</p>

  <h4>Testimony of James Williams</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">James Williams testified that in March 1999, he hired Mrs. Stamps in connection with an "accident
  case" against Wallace Trucking.  He claimed he was referred to her by Mr. Locklear.  Mr. Williams testified that he
  met with Mrs. Stamps directly, outside of the presence of Mr. Locklear.  According to Mr. Williams, Mrs. Stamps never
  advised him that she did not have a license to practice law in North Carolina.  Mr. Williams further denied that Mrs.
  Stamps ever told him she would be assisting Mr. Locklear; rather, she told him "she was gonna be the lawyer." He
  testified that she never indicated she would have to consult with Mr. Locklear before she did anything on the case
  and advised him her fee would be one-third of any recovery.  Mr. Williams stated that he was unclear about the actual
  settlement amount because he never saw the check from the insurance company.  He was paid his portion of the
  settlement through a check drawn on Mrs. Stamps' personal checking account.<a name="_ftnref5" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Believing Mrs. Stamps was a North Carolina-licensed attorney, he filed a
  complaint with the North Carolina State Bar to complain about her failure to pay his medical bills pursuant to a lien
  held by his treating physician, Dr. A.J. Sabella of the Sabella Chiropractic Clinic.</p>

  <h4>Testimony of Dr. A.J. Sabella</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">Dr. Sabella corroborated Mr. Williams' testimony that Mr. Williams' medical bills had not been
  paid.  He testified that he had forwarded requests for payment to "Lynn Stamps, Esq."  When no payment was made, he
  filed a disciplinary complaint against Mrs. Stamps with the North Carolina State Bar, assuming she was a licensed
  attorney.</p>

  <h4>Testimony of Robin Capps</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">Robin Capps, an adjuster with Royal and Sun Alliance, testified that she often spoke to Mrs.
  Stamps and corresponded with her.  As early as November 30, 1998, Mrs. Stamps contacted her regarding the personal
  injury settlement of Mr. Locklear's client, Carl Oxedine.  She stated she was under the impression that Mrs. Stamps
  was a licensed attorney, and that she was never advised otherwise.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2002-07-10_01-DB-039.htm">Recommendation of the Hearing
  Committee</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Following the conclusion of the formal hearing, the hearing committee issued its recommendation. 
  Prior to reaching the merits, the hearing committee discussed respondents' exception, in which they asserted
  Louisiana lacked jurisdiction because none of the misconduct complained of occurred in Louisiana and respondents were
  not licensed as attorneys at the time of the alleged misconduct.  In rejecting this argument, the committee observed
  that respondents' alleged misconduct involved failure to disclose information on applications to take the bar
  examination.  The committee concluded they consented to jurisdiction in Louisiana by seeking admission in this
  state.  Accordingly, the committee dismissed the exception.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On the merits, the hearing committee found the ODC proved respondents violated Rules 8.1 and 8.4
  by failing to provide truthful responses in their bar applications and engaging in conduct prejudicial to the
  administration of justice.  In particular, the committee found that by December 1998, respondents were well aware
  that they were going to be working for Mr. Locklear, and they should have disclosed that fact on their applications. 
  Further, even accepting respondents' argument that they had "no employment to disclose"  in December 1998, the
  committee pointed out they had a continuing duty to supplement their applications.  In support, the committee relied
  on  Rule 8.1(b), which  states that an applicant for admission "shall not . . . fail to disclose a fact necessary to
  correct a misapprehension. . . ."</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Moreover, based on the evidence in the record, the committee found respondents were clearly
  employed by Mr. Locklear.  It pointed out that they were paid by Mr. Locklear and cited language in the employment
  contract which referred to them as "employees."  The committee rejected respondents' explanations to the contrary as
  "insincere, unconvincing, and wholly incredible." </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As to the allegations of unauthorized practice of law, the committee found Mrs. Stamps engaged in
  the unauthorized practice of law in North Carolina, although it made no finding that Mr. Stamps had done so. 
  Nonetheless, the committee determined it made no difference whether or not Mr. and/or Mrs. Stamps did or did not
  practice law in North Carolina for purposes of whether they were required to disclose their employment with Mr.
  Locklear on their applications to take the bar examination.  The committee noted the  applications require disclosure
  of employment, not disclosure of the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Having found misconduct,  the committee turned to the issue of sanctions.  The committee
  concluded respondents' conduct was knowing.  As aggravating factors, it recognized multiple offenses and a refusal to
  acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct.  The committee identified no mitigating factors.  Based on its
  findings, the hearing committee recommended that respondents be disbarred from the practice of law. </p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2003-10-27_01-DB-039.htm">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Following its independent review of the record, the disciplinary board adopted most of the
  hearing committee's factual findings.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The board concurred in the committee's legal findings that respondents violated Rules 8.1 and 8.4
  by failing to disclose their employment with Mr. Locklear on their applications to take the bar examination.  The
  board determined this finding was supported by the evidence in the record, including the employment contract, letters
  written by Mr. Stamps regarding the Blackwell matters, testimony of the adjuster for Royal and Sun Alliance that Mrs.
  Stamps had been working for Mr. Locklear as early as November 30, 1998, and the testimony of Carolin Bakewell,
  counsel for the North Carolina State Bar, regarding the splitting of fees.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">With regard to the unauthorized practice of law allegations, the board agreed with the
  committee's finding that Mrs. Stamps violated Rule 5.5 by engaging in the unauthorized practice of law in North
  Carolina.  The board further determined the record supported the conclusion that Mr. Stamps also engaged in the
  unauthorized practice of law in North Carolina.  In support, the board relied on the employment contract, the letters
  written by Mr. Stamps to Mr. Locklear concerning the cases he worked on and the amount of money owed by the clients
  in the cases, the testimony of Ms. Bakewell concerning the splitting of fees, and the testimony of Mr. Blackwell
  relative to his various legal matters.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Addressing the issue of an appropriate sanction, the board found that respondents violated a duty
  owed to their clients, the legal system and the profession, resulting in significant actual injury.  The board
  determined their unauthorized practice of law caused inadequate and improper representation to the clients, and the
  disciplinary system suffered undue burden and expense because of respondents' false applications.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The board recognized multiple offenses and refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the
  conduct as aggravating factors.  As mitigating factors, it identified the lack of prior discipline and inexperience
  in the practice of law.  Considering these factors, the board recommended that respondents be suspended from the
  practice of law for a period of two years. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Two board members dissented as to the leniency of the proposed sanction, finding disbarment to be
  appropriate under the facts.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC and respondents filed objections to the disciplinary board's recommendation. 
  Accordingly, the matter was docketed pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(G)(1)(a).</p>

  <h2>  DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court.  La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence.  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Quaid</i>,
  94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 348</span>;
  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall</i>, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d
  444</a>, 445 (La. 1992)</span>.</p>

  <h3>  Procedural Issues</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Prior to addressing the merits, we must consider several procedural issues raised  by
  respondents.  First, they assert this court lacks jurisdiction to consider their actions, which occurred outside of
  this state prior to their admission to the practice of law.  Secondly, they contend that the hearing committee erred
  in denying their motion to sever their cases.  Finally, they urge the hearing committee erred in admitting hearsay
  evidence.  We will address these matters in turn.</p>

  <h4>Exception of Lack of Jurisdiction</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">It is well settled that this court has exclusive and plenary power to define and regulate all
  facets of the practice of law, including the admission of attorneys to the bar.  <span class="cite"><i>Bester v.
  Louisiana Supreme Court Comm. on Bar Admissions</i>, 00-1360 (La. 2/21/01), 779 So. 2d 715</span>;
  <span class="cite"><i>In re</i> <i>Bar Exam Class Action</i>, 99-2880 (La. 2/18/00), 752 So. 2d 159</span>;
  <span class="cite"><i>Succession of Wallace,</i> 574 So. 2d 348, 350 (La. 1991)</span>; <span class="cite"><i>Ex
  Parte Steckler</i>, 179 La. 410, 154 So. 41 (1934)</span>.  Pursuant to that authority, we adopted Rule 8.1 of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct, which places an explicit duty on an "applicant for admission to the bar" to refrain
  from knowingly making false statements of material fact on an application for admission and to disclose facts
  necessary to correct any misapprehensions arising in such a matter.  The comments to Rule 8.1 provide, in pertinent
  part:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The duty imposed by this Rule extends to persons seeking admission to the bar as well as lawyers.  Hence, if a
    person makes a material false statement in connection with an application for admission, it may be the basis for
    subsequent disciplinary action if the person is admitted. . .</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">The obvious purpose for this disclosure requirement is to provide this court with the information
  it needs to make an informed determination of whether the applicant possesses sufficient character and fitness to be
  admitted to the practice of law in this state.  Information relating to an applicant's employment, especially the
  applicant's employment in a legal setting, is particularly relevant.  Supreme Court Rule XVII, § 5(C) indicates an
  applicant's "misconduct in employment" and "commission of an act constituting the unauthorized practice of law" are
  factors to be considered in determining whether an applicant possesses the requisite character and fitness to be
  admitted to the bar. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Clearly, this court has jurisdiction to discipline a lawyer when it is subsequently determined
  the lawyer deprived this court in the bar admission process of vital information relative to whether the individual
  possessed the necessary character and fitness for admission.  To hold otherwise would encourage applicants to
  withhold information during the application process.  Our review of the jurisprudence of our sister states indicates
  they have reached similar conclusions.  <i>See</i> <span class="cite"><i>Matter of Cherryhomes</i>, 858 P.2d 401
  (N.M. 1993)</span> (New Mexico Supreme Court indefinitely suspended an attorney who, among other things, forged a
  physician's signature on a certificate of fitness required by the bar application process in another state);
  <span class="cite"><i>Matter of Rosen</i>, 570 A.2d 728 (D.C. App. 1989)</span> (nine-month suspension from practice
  imposed on an attorney for failure to supplement his Maryland bar application to indicate he was under investigation
  for professional misconduct in another state where he was admitted to practice); <span class="cite"><i>Matter of
  Scavone</i>, 524 A.2d 813 (N.J. 1987)</span> (attorney disbarred for falsely indicating on his bar application that
  he had never been subjected to disciplinary action or asked to withdraw from an educational institution, when the
  attorney was removed from a law school); <span class="cite"><i>In re: Chandler</i>, 641 N.E.2d 473 (Ill. 1994)</span>
  (three-year suspension imposed on an attorney who failed to disclose on her bar application that she provided false
  information on a mortgage loan application, as well as misstated her social security number in her bar application);
  <span class="cite"><i>State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Ass'n v. Flanery</i>, 863 P.2d 1146 (Okla. 1993)</span> (disbarment imposed on an attorney for embezzlement of $71,000 from family members prior to admission to
  the bar); <span class="cite"><i>Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Zdrok</i>, 645 A.2d 830 (Pa. 1994)</span> (attorney
  suspended for six months for pre-admission conduct of criminal loitering).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Accordingly, we see no merit to the exception of lack of jurisdiction and therefore deny it.</p>

  <h4>Motion to Sever</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">Mr. and Mrs. Stamps assert the hearing committee erred in failing to grant their motion to sever
  the cases against them. They contended there was a possibility of confusion if the evidence against them was heard at
  the same time. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC opposed the motion to sever, arguing that Mr. and Mrs. Stamps were charged together
  because they acted together in a common scheme.  The ODC suggested the evidence in the case would not be complex and
  the hearing committee  would have no difficulty determining whether a witness was referring to individual actions
  taken by Mr. Stamps or Mrs. Stamps.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The hearing committee denied the motion to sever.  Mr. and Mrs. Stamps now seek review of that
  ruling.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As a threshold matter, we note that the Stamps were well aware that they were charged together at
  the time of the filing of the formal charges on April 16, 2001.  Notwithstanding, they did not file their motion to
  sever until September 10, 2001, over five months later and less than three weeks before the hearing was set to
  commence.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Turning to the merits of the motion, we find no indication from the record that  Mr. and Mrs.
  Stamps were prejudiced in any way as a result of the joint hearing.  Mr. and Mrs. Stamps did not present antagonistic
  defenses; indeed, both were represented by the same counsel throughout these proceedings.  The record reveals the
  witnesses clearly distinguished the actions of Mr. and Mrs. Stamps in their testimony.  Likewise, the hearing
  committee and disciplinary board drew distinctions between the two in their reports.  Thus, there is no support in
  the record for the conclusion that the joint hearing created any confusion.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In sum, we find respondents have produced no evidence of prejudice which would have required a
  severance of the charges against them.  Accordingly, the motion to sever was properly denied.</p>

  <h4>Evidentiary Issues</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondents argue the hearing committee erred in considering various evidence which they contend
  are subject to hearsay objections.  Specifically, respondents object to certain unauthenticated records, as well as
  evidence and the findings of fact in Mr. Locklear's disciplinary case. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In response, the ODC asserts that the documents are not inherently unreliable since they were
  either admitted in the North Carolina disciplinary proceedings, produced from insurance company files, or submitted
  by respondents themselves.  The ODC further points out that respondents did not object to the admission of many of
  these documents, or objected with the assertion that they would explain these matters in their testimony.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In general, disciplinary proceedings are subject to the provisions of the Code of Evidence. 
  Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 18(B).  However, in <i>In re: Quaid</i>, 94-1316 at p. 8, n. 2 (La. 11/30/94),
  <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 348, we observed that the unique position of this court as
  trier of fact in disciplinary proceedings lessened the need for strict application of those provisions of the Code of
  Evidence such as hearsay, which were primarily intended to govern jury trials:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We note, however, that the purpose of rules of evidence primarily intended to govern jury trials, particularly
    the hearsay rules, are less compelling in the context of imposing discipline on members of the legal profession.
    This Court retains power to determine the ultimate question of admissibility under its original jurisdiction as the
    triers of fact in disciplinary proceedings, and it may well be more appropriate in disciplinary proceedings to be

  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">Unlike a lay jury, this court, in its role as trier of fact in disciplinary cases, has the
  ability to consider the entire record and evaluate and weigh the probative value of  evidence based on the totality
  of the circumstances.  Considering the record as a whole, we find the hearing committee did not err in admitting the
  disputed evidence.</p>

  <h3>  Factual and Legal Findings</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Having disposed of the procedural objections, we now review the record to determine if the
  charges against respondents have been proven by clear and convincing evidence.  The critical issue for purposes of
  our inquiry is whether respondents were employed by Mr. Locklear, such that their failure to disclose this employment
  resulted in a violation of Rule <span class="Rules">8.1</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondents have repeatedly denied that they were employed by Mr. Locklear, asserting that they
  were never paid by him.  The hearing committee found this defense to be  "insincere, unconvincing, and wholly
  incredible."<a name="_ftnref6" class="fn" href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a> Based on the overwhelming evidence of
  employment in the record, we find the committee's assessment to be entirely accurate.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In addition to the employment contract with Mr. Locklear, which is signed by both Mr. and Mrs.
  Stamps, the record contains copies of six checks issued by Mr. Locklear to Mr. Stamps, three checks issued by Mr.
  Locklear to Mrs. Stamps, and one check issued by Mr. Locklear to respondents jointly.  With one exception, each of
  the checks bears a notation indicating it was payment for a client matter.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Additionally, the ODC produced copies of correspondence written by Mr. Stamps to Mr. Locklear, in
  which he stated that "while employed as associates with your firm, we worked on six cases for Billy Blackwell."  This
  correspondence was corroborated by testimony from Mr. Blackwell, who stated unequivocally that he consulted with both
  Mr. and Mrs. Stamps regarding legal matters.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Considering the overwhelming evidence, it simply flies in the face of logic and common sense for
  respondents to assert that they did not believe they were employed by Mr. Locklear.  Respondents' failure to disclose
  their employment with Mr. Locklear on their bar applications or supplement their applications to reveal it leads to
  the inescapable conclusion that they knowingly sought to withhold this information from this court.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">We further find that the record convincingly demonstrates that respondents' failure to disclose
  their employment prevented this court from obtaining access to information which had a significant bearing on their
  character and fitness - namely, whether they engaged in the unauthorized practice of law while working in the law
  office of Mr. Locklear.  The evidence suggests an investigation would have clearly revealed both Mr. and Mrs. Stamps
  engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in North Carolina.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">With regard to Mr. Stamps, as noted earlier, the record contains copies of five checks issued to
  him by Mr. Locklear, four of which contain notations relating to fees for client matters.  Mr. Blackwell testified
  that he met with Mr. Stamps concerning legal matters and was led to believe that Mr. Stamps was an attorney.  Mr.
  Stamps' own correspondence to Mr. Locklear identifies Mr. Stamps (and his wife) as "associates with your firm" and
  discusses work done on Mr. Blackwell's legal matters.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As to Mrs. Stamps, the testimony of Mr. Blackwell, Mr. Williams, Ms. Capps, and Dr. Sabella all
  demonstrate that Mrs. Stamps gave the clear impression that she was a licensed attorney.  The record includes
  correspondence drafted and signed by Mrs. Stamps on behalf of Mr. Locklear's law firm.  These letters identify Mrs.
  Stamps as "Esq.," a title commonly used by lawyers.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In summary, based on the overwhelming evidence, we conclude that in connection with the bar
  application process, respondents knowingly concealed from this court information relating to their employment.  This
  failure to disclose prevented this court from discovering information regarding their unauthorized practice of law in
  another state, an issue which has a critical bearing on their character and fitness.</p>

  <h3>  Sanctions</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Having found professional misconduct, we now turn to a determination of the appropriate sanction
  for this misconduct.  In addressing the issue of sanctions, we are mindful that the purpose of disciplinary
  proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to maintain the appropriate standards of professional
  conduct, to preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of
  the standards of the profession.  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Vaughan</i>, 00-1892 (La. 10/27/00),
  <a href="2000-10-27_2000-1892.htm">772 So. 2d 87</a></span>; <span class="cite"><i>In re: Lain</i>, 00-0148 (La.
  5/26/00), <a href="2000-05-26_2000-0148.htm">760 So. 2d 1152</a></span>.  The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances.  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Redd</i>, 95-1472 (La. 9/15/95),
  <a href="1995-09-15_1995-1472.htm">660 So. 2d 839</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">It is difficult to understate the seriousness of the misconduct in this case.  Through their
  knowingly deceitful actions, respondents have sought to frustrate this court's ability to make an informed
  determination of their character and fitness prior to admitting them to the bar of this state.  Their actions impede
  the fundamental responsibility of this court to assure the protection of the public and to safeguard the
  administration of justice.  <i>See</i> <span class="cite">Supreme Court Rule XVII, § 5(A)</span>;
  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Singer</i>, 012776 (La. 6/12/02), 819 So. 2d 1017</span>.  As the Supreme Court of New
  Jersey observed in <i>In re: Scavone</i>, 524 A.2d 813 (N.J. 1987):</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Candor and honesty are a lawyer's stock and trade. Truth is not a matter of convenience.
  Sometimes lawyers may find it inconvenient, embarrassing, or even painful to tell the truth. Nowhere is this more
  important than when an applicant applies for admission to the bar.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">By ignoring their fundamental duty of candor to this court at the very inception of their legal
  career and by victimizing clients in another state, respondents have convincingly demonstrated they lack the good
  moral character to practice law in Louisiana.  Unquestionably, the baseline sanction for such misconduct is
  disbarment.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">  As aggravating factors, we recognize the continuous <span class="ABAstandard">refusal of
  respondents to acknowledge the wrongful nature of their conduct</span>.<a name="_ftnref7" class="fn" href="#_ftn7"
  id="_ftnref7">[7]</a> We find no mitigating factors  from the record.<a name="_ftnref8" class="fn" href="#_ftn8"
  id="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Under these circumstances, we would be remiss in our constitutional duty to protect the citizens
  of this state if we did not remove respondents from the practice of law.  Accordingly, we must disbar
  respondents.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is ordered that the names of Jerry Jackson Stamps,
  Louisiana Bar Roll No. 26521, and Teresa LynnWitt-Stamps, Louisiana Bar Roll No. 26146, be stricken from the roll of
  attorneys and that their licenses to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked.  All costs and expenses in
  the matter are assessed against respondents in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal  interest
  to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  1999, faxed to Mr.  Locklear from Mr. Stamps' fax number, Mr. Stamps wrote on behalf of himself and his wife:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">As you already know, because they were discussed with you on numerous occasions,
    <strong>while employed as associates with your firm, we worked on six cases for Billy Blackwell.</strong></p>

    <p class="footnotetext">* * *</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">All together, we spent a total of 50 hours on the above cases for Billy Blackwell.  As you
    know at $90 per hour, the legal fees would amount to $4,500.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">Billy knows that substantial work was done on all his cases, and you know that substantial
    work was done on his cases.  He called us in Mississippi and asked us to take over his cases, because he said that
    he had picked up the files from your office.  We told him we could not handle his cases because we were no longer
    with your firm, but that we might rejoin your firm again in July, which is what we agreed upon the last time we
    talked.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">As you know, any money we received from anyone was always discussed with you, and Billy's
    case was no exception. . . .</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">If Billy still wants us to represent him we would be glad to handle all of his cases if it
    could be worked out for us to do so. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="footnotetext">In another letter, dated June 19, 1999, directed to Mr. Locklear, Mr. Stamps, on behalf of
  himself and his wife, wrote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">To clarify, Billy Blackwell signed 3 personal injury retainer agreements.  I do not think
    we should do these cases unless we receive money up front, so I informed Billy we needed at least $1,500.00 before
    we could begin doing any work on the cases.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext"><strong>As you should recall he phoned you and asked if he could pay in installments, and
    you told him it was up to me.  I told Billy he would have to pay $1,500 so he then called you again and complained

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn3" class="fn" href="#_ftnref3" id="_ftn3">[3]</a>  Mr. Locklear was ultimately
  disbarred in North Carolina by consent.  <span class="cite"><i>North Carolina State Bar v. Gabrielee Locklear,

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn4" class="fn" href="#_ftnref4" id="_ftn4">[4]</a> In correspondence to the ODC,
  Carolin Bakewell, counsel for the North Carolina State Bar, indicated that  North Carolina did not pursue charges
  against respondents for unauthorized practice of law, noting that they had fled the state.  However, Ms. Bakewell
  wrote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">You will find enclosed copies of our witness interviews and letters from our file regarding
    the Stamps' conduct, which I hope you will find helpful.  It is difficult to determine which is the biggest
    scoundrel in this mess: Locklear or the Stamps, but it is certain that the three of them have caused a great deal
    of harm to the public in North Carolina.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn5" class="fn" href="#_ftnref5" id="_ftn5">[5]</a> It is noteworthy that the
  claims adjuster issued a check on May 13, 1999 in the amount of $7,000 made payable only to "<b><i>Lynn Stamps,
  Attorney for John Williams</i></b>."  Not only was Mr. Williams' name improperly written as <i>John</i> instead of
  <i>James</i>, he was not included as a payee on the check.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn6" class="fn" href="#_ftnref6" id="_ftn6">[6]</a> For example, Mr. Stamps
  initially denied ever receiving a "penny" from Mr. Locklear and emphatically denied ever being given any checks by
  Mr. Locklear.  When the ODC produced copies of the checks, Mr. Stamps then claimed these checks were simply for
  "travel expenses" and denied even knowing the clients listed on the checks.  In the face of such glaring
  inconsistencies, it is difficult to find such testimony credible.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn7" class="fn" href="#_ftnref7" id="_ftn7">[7]</a> Indeed, rather than
  acknowledging their misconduct, it appears respondents may have made deliberate misrepresentations or untruthful
  statements in their sworn statements.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn8" class="fn" href="#_ftnref8" id="_ftn8">[8]</a> The disciplinary board
  recognized inexperience in the practice of law and lack of a prior disciplinary record as mitigating factors.  We
  find absolutely no basis to consider these factors in mitigation.  Respondents' inexperience has no bearing on their
  failure to disclose basic information on their applications to take the bar examination.  Likewise, the lack of a
  prior disciplinary record holds little sway, considering the fact that the misconduct occurred at the very inception
  of respondents' legal career in this state.</p>
