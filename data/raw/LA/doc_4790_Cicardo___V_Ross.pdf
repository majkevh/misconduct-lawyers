  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: VINCENT ROSS CICARDO</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from one count of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Vincent Ross Cicardo, an attorney licensed to practice law in
  Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The underlying facts of this matter are not disputed. On March 26, 2002, respondent, through
  counsel, reported to the ODC that he had periodically used funds in his client trust account for the operation of his
  law office. A subsequent audit of the trust account for the period January 1, 1997 through December 31, 2001
  confirmed that respondent withdrew funds from the account at times and in amounts not directly related to the
  conclusion of his cases. These withdrawals came from funds held in the trust account awaiting final determination of
  medical liens or subrogation claims, funds representing respondent's attorney's fees that had not been promptly
  withdrawn from the account, and from attorney's fees deposited to the account that were not required to be so
  deposited. The audit revealed no instance in which a client or third party was underpaid, nor any unreasonable or
  unexplained delays in payments to clients and third parties.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">During the period of time at issue, respondent was dependent upon and impaired by alcohol, a
  condition for which he subsequently sought and obtained rehabilitative treatment.<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2"
  id="fnref2">2</a> On February 26, 2002, respondent entered into a two-year recovery contract with the Lawyers
  Assistance Program (LAP).</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On March 27, 2003, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent, alleging that
  his "rolling commingling and conversion" of client and third-party funds violated Rules 1.15(a) and (b) (safekeeping
  property of clients or third persons) and 8.4(a) (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct. Respondent filed an answer admitting the formal charges and rule violations, and requesting a
  hearing in mitigation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">At the hearing, the ODC introduced documentary evidence for the hearing committee's
  consideration, including the audit report of respondent's trust account activity and the sworn testimony of the
  certified public accountant who performed the audit. The witnesses who testified consisted of respondent, members of
  his family, representatives of the LAP, attorneys and judges who are long-time friends of respondent's, and the
  licensed clinical social worker who has seen respondent for weekly after-care counseling sessions since his discharge
  from Palmetto. All of respondent's witnesses testified favorably as to his character, competence, and sincere desire
  to overcome his alcoholism.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2003-06-12_03-DB-018.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The testimony presented at the hearing revealed that respondent's misuse of his trust account
  funds began in early 1997, shortly after the death of his father, with whom respondent had been practicing law since
  his graduation from law school. The elder Mr. Cicardo had handled all the business aspects of the practice, including
  managing the trust account. Respondent's misuse of the trust account continued for several years, but the hearing
  committee found there was no actual injury to any clients or third persons as a result.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee noted the personal, emotional, and financial problems that respondent experienced
  in the wake of his father's death, including alcohol abuse and dependency, divorce, and bankruptcy. After several
  years, respondent finally came to realize that he had to change his way of life, and to do the right things for the
  right reasons, notwithstanding the consequences. Respondent admitted himself to a treatment facility, self-reported
  his misuse of his trust account to the ODC, fully cooperated with the ODC, including audits of his trust account with
  continuous monitoring thereafter, entered into a recovery agreement with LAP, attended Alcoholics Anonymous, and
  obtained counseling. The committee found respondent has satisfied all conditions imposed by those programs and by the
  ODC, and that he continues to do so, including operating his trust account correctly.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee further noted that respondent admitted his misconduct with respect to his trust
  account, admitted he knew his actions were inappropriate, admitted the potential injury that resulted from his
  actions, and accepted the blame and responsibility for his actions and the consequences. The committee commended
  respondent for his courage in doing the right thing for his clients, the public, the legal profession, and the legal
  system, and observed that respondent exhibited genuine remorse for his misconduct. The committee concluded that
  respondent has turned his life around and has once again become a contributing member of the profession.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these factual findings, the committee determined that respondent knowingly violated
  duties owed to his clients, the public, and to the profession.  Although no actual injury resulted from respondent's
  misuse of his client trust account, the potential for injury was significant. The committee concluded the appropriate
  baseline sanction is a suspension from the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In aggravation, the committee recognized respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of
  misconduct</span> over a period of five years and his <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the
  practice of law</span> (admitted 1984). As mitigating factors, the committee recognized the
  <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a
  dishonest or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">personal and emotional problems</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board and a cooperative attitude toward the
  proceedings</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">good character and reputation</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">alcohol
  dependency</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">interim rehabilitation</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">and
  remorse</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, and particularly considering respondent's self-reporting to and full
  cooperation with the ODC, as well as his voluntary interim treatment and contract with the LAP, the committee
  recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year, fully deferred, subject to a two-year
  period of probation with conditions.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-03-31_03-DB-018.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent admitted in his answer to the formal charges that he violated Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.15(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.15(b)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct. At the hearing, respondent admitted that his conduct was knowing and violated duties
  owed to his clients. The disciplinary board found that while there is no documented evidence of harm to any
  particular client or third persons, the potential for significant harm existed<br />
  during the period of time in which respondent misused his client trust account.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board generally concurred in the hearing committee's assessment of the aggravating and
  mitigating factors. However, the board did not adopt the mitigating factor of alcohol dependency, given respondent's
  admission that alcohol was not the cause of his misconduct. Rather, the board determined respondent's alcohol abuse
  is more properly considered a personal or emotional problem, along with his divorce and bankruptcy.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions and the prior jurisprudence, the
  board agreed that the baseline sanction for respondent's "rolling commingling and conversion" of trust account funds
  is a suspension from the practice of law. In light of the weight of the mitigating factors present, the board found
  the fully deferred suspension recommended by the hearing committee is appropriate. Accordingly, the board recommended
  that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year, fully deferred, subject to a two-year period of
  probation governed by the following conditions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1. Respondent will extend his current LAP contract through February 26, 2007, and he will
    comply fully with all conditions of the contract.</p>

    <p class="inverted">2. Respondent's trust account will be audited semi-annually for a period of two years, for a
    total of four audits. The audits will be conducted by a certified public accountant selected or approved by the
    ODC, with the cost and expense of the audits to be paid by respondent.</p>

    <p class="inverted">3. During his first year of probation, respondent will attend and successfully complete the
    Ethics School offered by the Louisiana State Bar Association's Practice Assistance and Improvement Committee.
    During the second year of probation, respondent will attend eight additional hours of continuing legal education in
    the area of law practice management or the maintenance of client trust accounts, including any "trust accounting
    school" established by the Practice Assistance and Improvement Committee.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board also recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these
  proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of the court's judgment
  until paid.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In light of respondent's stipulation to the underlying facts and rule violations, the sole issue
  presented for our consideration in this case is the appropriate sanction for his misconduct. In considering that
  issue, we are mindful that the purpose of lawyer disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but
  rather to maintain appropriate standards of professional conduct to safeguard the public, to preserve the integrity
  of the legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the standards of the profession.
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Guidry, <a href="1990-12-03_1988-0829.htm">571 So. 2d 161</a> (La.
  1990)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses
  involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent has admitted that he mishandled his client trust account by keeping personal funds in
  the account, which he then borrowed from time to time to fund his operating account. Respondent's misconduct was
  knowing but caused no actual harm to his clients or to third parties; in fact, the ODC only learned of the misconduct
  because respondent self-reported it. In similar cases, this court has imposed fully or partially deferred
  suspensions, coupled with probation. See <span class="cite">In re: Caskey, 04-0168 (La. 2/20/04),
  <a href="2004-02-20_2004-0168.htm">866 So. 2d 226</a></span> (fully deferred six-month suspension, subject to a

  class="fn" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering this jurisprudence, the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct is clearly a
  short-term suspension from the practice of law. There are very substantial mitigating factors present in this case,
  including the absence of a prior disciplinary record, absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, personal and
  emotional problems, full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board and a cooperative attitude toward the
  proceedings, good character and reputation, and remorse. In light of these factors, we agree that the fully deferred
  suspension and probation recommended by the disciplinary board are appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will suspend respondent from the practice of law for one year, fully deferred,
  subject to a two-year period of probation governed by the conditions set forth in the disciplinary board's
  recommendation. We caution respondent that any violation of the conditions of probation, or any other misconduct
  during the probationary period, may be grounds for making the deferred suspension executory, or imposing additional
  discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Vincent Ross Cicardo, Louisiana Bar Roll number 14146, be suspended
  from the practice of law for a period of one year. It is further ordered that said suspension shall be fully
  deferred, subject to respondent's successful completion of a two-year period of probation governed by the conditions
  set forth in the disciplinary board's recommendation. Any violation of the conditions of probation, or any other
  misconduct during the probationary period, may be grounds for making the deferred suspension executory, or imposing
  additional discipline, as appropriate. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in
  accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality
  of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> The audit concluded that in several of
  respondent's cases, he paid out too much money to a third party, and as a result, the trust account was shorted the
  funds. Furthermore, $218 in bank fees were erroneously charged to the account, and an overpayment of $100 to a
  medical provider was not charged to any case. As of December 31, 2001, there was a net shortfall in the trust account
  of $370.74, which has been repaid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">2</a> On November 19, 2001, respondent voluntarily
  entered Palmetto Addiction Recovery Center in Rayville, Louisiana, where he remained until February 8, 2002.
  Respondent has been sober since the date of his admission to Palmetto.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3" id="fn3">3</a> To the extent that any conversion of client funds
  resulted from respondent's mishandling of his trust account, Hinrichs instructs that</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">A suspension from practice of one year or less will typically result where the negligence
    in withdrawing or retaining client funds is not gross or of a high degree. No other fraudulent acts are committed
    in connection with the violation of the disciplinary rule. There is no serious harm or threat of harm to the
    client. Full restitution is made promptly, usually before any legal proceeding or disciplinary complaint is made.
