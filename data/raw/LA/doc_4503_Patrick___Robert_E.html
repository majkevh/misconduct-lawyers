<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 01-B-1419</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: ROBERT E. PATRICK</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>

<p class="bodycopy">This disciplinary proceeding 
arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) 
against respondent, Robert E. Patrick.</p>
<h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">On July 9, 1999, we disbarred 
respondent from the practice of law for conduct unrelated to the instant 
proceeding. <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Patrick</i>, 99-0771 (La. 7/2/99),
<a href="#!-- #ID:738%20So.2d%20539 --#">738 So. 2d 539</a></span>. Respondent’s 
misconduct in that case included commingling and conversion of client funds and 
submission of false evidence in an attempt to cover up his<br>
wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">In addition to respondent’s 1999 
disbarment, we previously imposed a deferred ninety day suspension on respondent 
for providing inaccurate information to clients and courts in two criminal 
matters. <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Patrick</i>, 95-1621 (La. 9/15/95), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:660%20So.2d%20433 --#">660 So. 2d 433</a></span>.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board has 
admonished respondent on two prior occasions. In 1995, the disciplinary board 
admonished respondent for incompetence, failure to communicate and assessing an 
improper fee. In 1991, the board admonished him for improper use of a client 
trust account.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<h3>Count I</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">In September 1996, Quincy M. 
Edwards retained respondent to represent him in a personal injury case against 
State Farm Insurance Company. Shortly thereafter, respondent settled the matter 
on behalf of his client. On October 7, 1996, State Farm issued a settlement 
check in the amount of $10,000, made payable to respondent, Mr. Edwards and Mr. 
Edwards’ previous attorney in the matter, Eldon Guillory. Subsequently, 
respondent signed Mr. Guillory’s name to the check, without Mr. Guillory’s 
knowledge or consent, and negotiated it. Respondent kept the entirety of the 
proceeds, and never notified Mr. Guillory of the settlement nor attempted to 
negotiate a division of fees with him.</p>
<h3>Count II</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">In connection with the Edwards 
litigation (which is the subject of Count I), Mr. Edwards had incurred medical 
bills in the amount of $3,400 for treatment provided to him by the England-Masse 
Chiropractic Clinic (“England-Masse”). Respondent was put on notice that 
England-Masse maintained a privilege or lien on the settlement proceeds. 
However, after the settlement was perfected, respondent converted these funds to 
his own use. England-Masse sent numerous requests for payment to respondent, but 
respondent failed or refused to remit the funds. As a result, England-Masse 
filed suit against respondent to obtain a monetary judgment for the amount of 
the lien.</p>
<h3>Count III</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">In late 1998, Keatha Poullard 
retained respondent to represent her in a personal injury matter. Subsequently, 
respondent settled the case for $3,200. He forged Ms. Poullard’s name to the 
settlement check and negotiated it, without her knowledge and consent. When the 
third party health care providers demanded payment from Ms. Poullard, respondent 
advised her to tell them her treating physicians had agreed to “write off the 
bill,” which respondent knew was false. Moreover, respondent did not provide his 
client with the correct portion of her interest in the settlement, and did not 
provide his client with an accounting or disbursement sheet.<a class="fn" href="#fn1">[1]</a> 
Subsequently, Ms. Poullard filed suit against respondent. The court determined respondent had<br>
converted her funds. </p>
<h3>Count IV</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">On October 31, 1997, Creighton M. 
Moss, an inmate, retained respondent for the purpose of obtaining a transfer to 
another correctional facility. Mr. Moss paid respondent the sum of $10,000. 
Subsequently, respondent performed little or no services on behalf of Mr. Moss 
and refused to communicate with him regarding the status of the legal matter. 
Respondent failed to provide an accounting, return his client’s file or refund 
the unearned portion of the fee, despite repeated requests.</p>
<h3>Count V</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">On January 22, 1998, David and 
Teresa Joshlin retained respondent to represent them in connection with an 
injury that their son had suffered at school on May 19, 1997. Aware the 
prescriptive date was approaching, Mrs. Joshlin repeatedly called respondent 
during the months of March, April and May of 1998. Respondent failed to return 
her calls.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Interim Suspension</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">After receiving complaints against 
respondent, the ODC filed a motion in this court seeking to place respondent on 
immediate interim suspension for threat of harm pursuant to 
<span class="AllRules">Supreme Court Rule 
XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s19B --#">19</a>(B)</span>. This court ordered respondent to 
show cause before a hearing committee why he should not be placed on interim 
suspension. After a hearing, the committee concluded respondent posed a “clear 
and present danger” to the public while he remained in the practice of law, and 
recommended he be placed on immediate interim suspension. On March 24, 1999, 
this court placed respondent on interim suspension. <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Patrick</i>, 
99-0410 (La. 3/24/99), <a href="#!-- #ID:733%20So.2d%201180 --#">733 So. 2d 1180</a></span>.</p>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed 
formal charges against respondent.<a class="fn" href="#fn2">[2]</a> The charges alleged violations of the 
following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules
<span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.1 --#">1.1</a></span> (incompetence),
<span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.4 --#">1.4</a></span> (failure to communicate),
<span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.8 --#">1.8</a>(h)</span> (making an unlawful agreement to 
prospectively limit the lawyer’s liability to a client for malpractice in the 
absence of advising client to seek independent legal advice),<span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.15 --#">1.15</a>(b)</span> (failure to promptly deliver funds or 
property owed to a client or third party and failure to render a full accounting 
upon request), <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.15 --#">1.15</a>(c)</span> (failure to place 
property subject to a dispute with another party in trust), <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.16 --#">1.16</a>(d)</span> (failure to protect client interests 
upon termination of representation), <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(b)</span> 
(commission of a criminal act adversely reflecting on a lawyer’s honesty, 
trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving 
deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation) and<span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(d)</span> (conduct prejudicial 
to the administration of justice).</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Respondent failed to file an answer to the formal charges. Accordingly, no
formal hearing was conducted, and the matter was submitted to the hearing 
committee
on documentary evidence.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-097 --#">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="bodycopy">The committee found that the allegations against respondent were proven by the
ODC by clear and convincing evidence, and were supported by the documentary
evidence. It determined respondent intentionally violated duties owed as a 
professional
to his clients, to the public and to the legal system, resulting in actual 
injury to his
clients.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">The committee found no mitigating factors. As aggravating factors, it
recognized the presence of prior disciplinary offenses, dishonest or selfish 
motive,
pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, refusal to acknowledge wrongful 
conduct,
substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted in 1983) and 
indifference to
making restitution.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Considering these factors, the committee found imposition of disbarment to be
appropriate under the facts. Noting respondent is currently disbarred from the
practice of law, the committee recommended respondent be disbarred again and not
eligible to seek reinstatement until five years from the order imposed in this 
matter.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-097.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board adopted the findings and recommendation of the hearing
committee in all respects. The board found this court has consistently disbarred
attorneys who engaged in misconduct similar to that in the instant case. Finding 
no
reason to deviate from this sanction, the board recommended respondent be
disbarred.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the
recommendation of the disciplinary board, which was filed in this court on May 
15,
2001. In light of the egregious facts of this case, we deferred action on the 
case
pending our consideration of a rule relating to permanent disbarment</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">On August 1, 2001, after a lengthy period of study and public comment, this
court adopted amendments to Supreme Court Rule XIX, §10 <a class="fn" href="#fn3">
[3]</a> and §24<a class="fn" href="#fn4">[4]</a> to provide for 3 
4
the sanction of permanent disbarment. On September 13, 2001, we 
ordered respondent and the ODC to brief the issue of whether permanent disbarment 
should
be imposed in this matter.<a class="fn" href="#fn5">[5]</a> 
The order further provided that respondent could request
oral argument in his brief, and that if such a request was made, the case would 
be
docketed; otherwise, the matter would be considered only on the briefs. 
Respondent
did not file a brief.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">However, on October 3, 2001, two attorneys potentially facing permanent
disbarment filed a “Motion for Leave to File <i>Amicus Curiae</i> Brief, for Oral 
Argument,
and to Participate in Oral Argument.” The amici asserted that they are in a 
similar
posture to respondent as their misconduct occurred prior to August 1, 2001, but 
the
ODC will be seeking to permanently disbar them.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Because of the unusual issues presented in this case, we permitted the amici to
file briefs and participate in oral argument. At oral argument, the amici 
suggested that
the permanent disbarment rules could not operate retroactively because to do so
would deprive the respondent-attorney of the right to seek readmission, a right 
granted
to him at the time of the underlying misconduct. In opposition, the ODC argued 
that
this court always had discretion to foreclose a disbarred attorney from seeking
readmission, and contended the rule changes were merely guidelines by which the
court will exercise its discretion and authority.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Having considered the record of the instant proceeding in light of the 
well-presented
arguments of the amici and the ODC, we now conclude that we need not
resolve the issue of retroactivity of the permanent disbarment rules in the 
context of
the present facts.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Our review of the record in this case reveals the misconduct in the instant case
occurred within the same time frame as the misconduct which formed the basis for 
respondent’s prior disbarment. In <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:573%20So.2d%20470 --#">573 
So. 6
2d 470</a> (La. 1991)</span>, we observed that when the underlying conduct occurs within 
the
same period as the misconduct forming the basis for a previous disbarment, the
discipline imposed should be determined as if both proceedings were before the 
court
simultaneously. Applying this procedure in <i>Chatelain</i>, we declined to extend the
minimum period for readmission. Instead, we adjudged the respondent guilty of
additional violations which were added to his record for consideration in the 
event he
applied for readmission after becoming eligible to do so.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction in the instant case, we believe the
approach of <i>Chatelain</i> is instructive. Accordingly, our determination of a 
sanction
will be based upon the appropriate sanction we would have imposed if these 
charges
had been before the court at the same time as the charges in respondent’s 
previous
disciplinary proceedings.<a class="fn" href="#fn7">[7]</a> </p>
<p class="bodycopy">Disbarment is clearly the appropriate penalty for respondent’s action in the
instant case. His actions were knowing and intentional, resulting in potential 
and actual
harm to his clients and the legal profession. He has converted a substantial sum 
of
funds owed to Mr. Guillory, England-Masse and Ms. Poullard, as well as Mr. Moss,
who was incarcerated at the time. England-Masse and Ms. Poullard had to undergo
inconvenience and expense to obtain monetary judgments against respondent for 
his
professional misconduct.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board did not identify any mitigating factors, and we are 
unable
to discern any from the record. By contrast, significant aggravating factors 
are present, including respondent’s substantial experience in the practice of 
law, the
presence of multiple offenses and his indifference to making restitution.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Had the instant charges been filed simultaneously with those charges forming
the basis of respondent’s earlier disbarment, they would have only reinforced 
our view
that respondent lacks the moral fitness to practice law and must be disbarred, 
both as
a sanction for his misconduct and to protect the public. Therefore, as in 
<i>Chatelain</i>,
we will adjudge respondent guilty of additional violations which warrant 
disbarment
and which will be added to his record for consideration in the event he applies 
for
readmission after becoming eligible to do so. We further emphasize that although
respondent may have a procedural right to apply for readmission, this court 
retains
absolute discretion to grant or deny such an application. In light of 
respondent’s
lengthy history of egregious misconduct, this court will carefully scrutinize 
any
application for readmission with a critical eye.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">In sum, without passing on the question of whether we could apply the
permanent disbarment rules to this case, we elect in our discretion to resolve 
this case
under the principles set forth in <i>Chatelain</i>. Accordingly, respondent is adjudged
guilty of additional violations which warrant disbarment and which will be added 
to his
record for consideration in the event he applies for readmission after becoming 
eligible
to do so.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">For the reasons assigned, respondent, Robert E. Patrick, is adjudged guilty of
additional violations which warrant disbarment and which will be added to his 
record
for consideration in the event he applies for readmission after becoming 
eligible to do
so. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in 
accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s10.1 --#">10.1</a>, with legal interest to commence
thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s judgment until paid.</p>
<hr>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> Initially, respondent paid Ms. Poullard 
$300 as her portion of proceeds from the settlement.
Later, when she went to his office to find out why her medical expenses had not 
been satisfied,
respondent issued her a $215.06 personal check with the condition that she 
promise to testify on his
behalf in the event her medical provider sued him.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> The formal charges initially involved a sixth count of misconduct. The 
hearing committee 
dismissed the charge, finding insufficient evidence to support the charge, and 
the disciplinary board
affirmed the dismissal. The ODC did not object to the dismissal. Accordingly, we 
will not address this
charge.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> 
Supreme Court Rule XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s10 --#">10</a>(A) was amended to 
add the highlighted language: </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="footnotetext">(1) Disbarment by the court. <b>In any order or judgment of the court
in which a lawyer is disbarred, the court retains the discretion to
permanently disbar the lawyer and permanently prohibit any such
lawyer from being readmitted to the practice of law.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a>
Supreme Court Rule XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s24 --#">24</a>(A) was amended to add the highlighted language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="footnotetext">A disbarred lawyer or a suspended lawyer who has served a suspension
period of more than one year, exclusive of any waivers or periods of
deferral, shall be reinstated or readmitted only upon order of the court. No
lawyer may petition for reinstatement until six months before the period of
suspension has expired. No lawyer may petition for readmission until five
years after the effective date of disbarment. A lawyer who has been
placed on interim suspension and is then disbarred for the same
misconduct that was the ground for the interim suspension may petition for
readmission at the expiration of five years from the time of the effective
date of the interim suspension. <b>The court retains the discretion, in
accordance with Section 10A of this rule, to permanently disbar a
lawyer and permanently prohibit any such lawyer from being
readmitted to the practice of law.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">5</a> Similar orders were issued in
<span class="CITE"> 
<i>In re: Gros</i>, <a href="#!-- ID:815%20So.2d%20799 --">98-B-0772</a></span>, and
<span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Parker</i>, <a href="#!-- ID:815%20So.2d%20794 --">00-B-3532</a></span>. We
address those cases in separate opinions rendered this day.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn6">6</a> 
It is noteworthy that at the time we considered the charges forming the basis of 
respondent’s 1999
disbarment, he had already been placed on interim suspension for the instant 
charges.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn7">7</a>
Our decision should not be interpreted as espousing the position advanced by the 
amici in this case 7
that the date of the misconduct determines whether the permanent disbarment 
rules should be applied. As
noted above, we expressly decline to resolve that issue, and nothing in this 
opinion should be interpreted
as passing on whether we could or could not impose permanent disbarment under 
these facts.</p>
