<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 02-B-1921</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: ROBERT P. AULSTON, III</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

<p>PER CURIAM</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 21(A)<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a>, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) has filed a motion for reciprocal discipline against respondent, Robert P. Aulston, III, an attorney licensed to practice law in the States of Louisiana and 
Illinois, based upon discipline imposed by the Supreme Court of Illinois. </p>

<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">The record indicates that respondent was charged in the Illinois proceeding with two counts of misconduct relating to his handling of two client matters. In Count I, it was alleged that respondent violated Rules <span class="Rules">
<a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=RULE1.3$t=document-frameset.htm" target="main">1.3</a></span>, <span class="Rules"><a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=RULE1.4$t=document-frameset.htm" target="main">1.4</a></span>, and <span class="Rules">
<a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=RULE1.8$t=document-frameset.htm" target="main">1.8</a>(g)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct when he neglected a legal matter and then misled his client by fabricating a settlement and paying the client out of his own funds. In Count II, it was alleged that 
respondent violated Rule 1.4 when he failed to respond to his clients' requests for information about their case after he was discharged. For this misconduct, the Hearing Board recommended that respondent be suspended for a period of ninety days, stayed in its entirety by a 180-day period of 
conditional probation. Over the objection of the Administrator of the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission, the Review Board affirmed the Hearing Board's findings and the recommendation of discipline. By judgment dated May 24, 2002, the Supreme Court of Illinois suspended 
respondent from the practice of law for ninety days, with the suspension stayed in its entirety and respondent placed on probation for 180 days, subject to conditions specified in the judgment. <a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a></p>

<p class="Bodycopy">By order of this court dated July 15, 2002, respondent was given thirty days pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 21(D)<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> to show why the imposition of discipline in this state would be unwarranted. Respondent failed to file any response in this 
court. </p>

<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">The imposition of reciprocal discipline against respondent based upon the Illinois judgment is clearly appropriate under the facts of this case. Respondent has failed to file any pleadings in this court demonstrating that the imposition of identical discipline in Louisiana would 
be unwarranted, and there is no suggestion of such upon the face of the record before us. Moreover, there is little doubt that respondent's conduct would warrant discipline under the Louisiana jurisprudence discussing misconduct similar to respondent's. See, e.g., <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Spears</i>, 
00 0028 (La. 2/4/00), <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=753%20So.2d%20204$t=document-frameset.htm" target="main">753 So. 2d 204</a> </span>(one year and thirty one day suspension, with all but thirty days deferred, subject to a two year period of supervised probation with conditions);
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Thompson</i>, 98 0079 (La. 5/8/98), <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=712%20So.2d%2072$t=document-frameset.htm" target="main">712 So. 2d 72</a> </span>(one-year suspension, deferred, subject to an eighteen month period of supervised probation with conditions). </p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will impose reciprocal discipline pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 21.</p>

<h2>DECREE</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">Considering the motion for reciprocal discipline filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and the record filed herein, it is ordered that Robert P. Aulston, III be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for ninety days. It is further ordered that this suspension shall 
be fully deferred, and respondent shall be placed on probation for one hundred eighty days, subject to the provision that any misconduct during this time will be grounds for making the deferred portion of the suspension executory. </p>
