  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-1808</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: JAMES L. YATES</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, James L. Yates, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana, but currently
  ineligible to practice.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <h3>Count I - The Windham Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In January 1998, Kerry Windham and three other inmates were injured while being transported from
  Dixon Correctional Institute to Baton Rouge for medical treatment. In August 1998, respondent was hired to handle the
  four inmates' personal injury claims. Respondent filed suit on behalf of his clients in January 1999.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Thereafter, respondent took no further action, and the case was dismissed. Despite receiving
  notice of the dismissal, respondent failed to take any remedial action or notify his clients of same.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In March 2003, Luther Windham, Kerry's father, filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC,
  alleging that respondent failed to communicate with him or his son regarding the case. Despite receiving notice of
  the complaint via certified mail, respondent failed to provide a written response to the ODC, necessitating the
  issuance of a subpoena to obtain his sworn statement. During the July 24, 2003 sworn statement, respondent admitted
  that he had neglected his clients' personal injury case. Respondent also admitted that he received the complaint
  filed against him and did not answer it. Respondent indicated that he was "not paying too much attention to these
  things like [he] used to."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span>
  (failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client) and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count II - The Thompson Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In June 1999, Annie Laura Thompson hired respondent to represent her in an appeal of an adverse
  judgment against her. Ms. Thompson paid respondent $2,000 to file the appeal, plus $150 in filing fees. Thereafter,
  Ms. Thompson felt that respondent was neglecting her case and not communicating with her. In December 1999, she fired
  him before he completed and filed the appeal. Despite not completing and filing the appeal, respondent admitted that
  he did not refund any portion of the fee he was paid.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a> He
  also was only able to produce a small amount of work product and a few notes regarding Ms. Thompson's case despite
  having possession of the file for some time.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct violated Rule <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span>
  (obligations upon termination of the representation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Following an investigation, the ODC filed two counts of formal charges against respondent.
  Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges, which were personally served upon him on March
  23, 2004. Accordingly, the factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear and
  convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). No formal hearing was held, but the parties were
  given an opportunity to file with the hearing committee written arguments and documentary evidence on the issue of
  sanctions. Respondent filed nothing for the hearing committee's consideration.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-12-13_04-DB-006.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After considering the ODC's submission in response to the deemed admitted order, the hearing
  committee determined that respondent has been ineligible to practice law since 2002 for failing to pay bar dues and
  the disciplinary assessment. As to the Windham matter, the committee stated the following:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Committee is constrained by the deemed admitted motion that the charges brought by ODC are to be considered
    by the Committee as "admitted." However, the Committee notes that Mr. Yates' response (in the record) indicates
    that, in fact, he did some work on the matter, attempted to locate his incarcerated client and eventually
    determined that the matter had little, if any, validity.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">With respect to the Thompson matter, the committee stated the following:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The complaint filed by Annie Thompson against Mr. Yates lists a number of charges. Mr. Yates' comprehensive
    response correspondence effectively rebuts virtually all of Ms. Thompson's accusations. It appears that Mr. Yates
    was faced with a very difficult task and a demanding client; eventually, he was terminated. However, it appears
    that he had obtained an extension of time to file the appellate brief and, in fact, Ms. Thompson did so pro se. The
    record does not reflect whether Ms. Thompson was successful with her appeal.</p>

    <p>Again, the Committee is constrained by the deemed admitted motion; in fact, Mr. Yates admits that he refunded no
    portion of the fee that he was paid by Ms. Thompson to prepare the appellate brief. . . .</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Regarding respondent's lack of cooperation with the ODC, the committee made the following
  determinations:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>As evidenced by the "deemed admitted" motion, Mr. Yates failed to timely respond when served with these
    complaints. Nevertheless, it does appear that he eventually responded both in letter form and by providing sworn
    deposition testimony. Further, Mr. Yates advised ODC that he had ceased the active practice of law by mid-2002. He
    had failed to obtain mandatory CLE and had not paid his Bar and disciplinary dues. ODC presented no evidence that
    Mr. Yates was, in fact, continuing to practice law after being suspended due to these unrelated events.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee determined, based on the deemed admitted order, that respondent violated the Rules
  of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges. Furthermore, based on the deemed admitted order, the
  committee determined that respondent violated duties owed to his clients and the disciplinary system. He acted
  negligently with regard to the Windham matter and in failing to refund unearned fees in the Thompson matter. The
  committee further determined that neither complainant suffered any harm and the legal community did not suffer
  serious harm.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee found no aggravating factors are present. As to mitigating factors, the committee
  found the following present: <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">personal or
  emotional problems</span>,<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a> <span class="ABAstandard">full
  and free disclosure to the disciplinary board and a cooperative attitude toward the proceedings</span>, and
  <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these findings, and because respondent has stopped practicing law for other reasons, the
  committee concluded that a period of suspension is "inappropriate and of little or no use in this situation." Rather,
  the committee recommended that if respondent reapplies to practice law, (1) he be required to obtain an additional
  two hours of continuing legal education in both Ethics and Professionalism prior to being reinstated, (2) he be
  placed on probation for one year from the date of his reinstatement, and (3) he repay Ms. Thompson all amounts she
  paid him for the preparation of the appellate brief.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">One member of the committee disagreed that the sanction issue is moot and would recommend a
  three-month suspension, fully deferred, subject to the other conditions set forth in the committee's report.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC objected to the hearing committee's report and recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2005-06-30_04-DB-006.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing this matter, the disciplinary board found that the hearing committee made several
  errors in its factual findings. The board made the following factual findings:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1. The deemed admitted facts show Ms. Thompson paid respondent $2,000;</p>

    <p class="inverted">2. Respondent's sworn statement does not establish by clear and convincing evidence that he
    worked on the Windham matter, attempted to locate his incarcerated client, and eventually determined that the
    matter had little validity. Respondent did not produce evidence of his work and admitted that he could not locate
    the file;</p>

    <p class="inverted">3. Both Mr. Windham and Ms. Thompson were harmed by respondent's conduct. Mr. Windham's lawsuit
    was dismissed because of inaction, and Ms. Thompson never received a refund of the unearned fees and filed her
    appeal herself;</p>

    <p class="inverted">4. Respondent did not file a written response to Mr. Windham's complaint. Therefore, the ODC
    had to subpoena him to give a sworn statement. Although respondent appeared and gave his sworn statement, this
    added an unnecessary delay and expense to this proceeding.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board determined that the committee correctly determined respondent violated the Rules of
  Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges. After filing the initial petition, respondent took no
  significant action in Mr. Windham's case, which led to the suit being dismissed. Furthermore, respondent did not take
  any remedial action after receiving notice of the dismissal, nor did he notify Mr. Windham of such. Respondent also
  admitted that he did not respond in writing to Mr. Windham's complaint filed with the ODC. Finally, respondent
  admitted that he did not refund any of the $2,000 fee he received from Ms. Thompson. He did not provide her with an
  accounting or return the unearned portion of the fee. He also was only able to produce a small amount of work product
  for her appeal.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board found that respondent violated duties owed to his clients and as a professional. His
  conduct was knowing, if not intentional, and caused harm to his clients. Based on the ABA's Standards for Imposing
  Lawyer Sanctions, the board determined the baseline sanction to be a period of suspension.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The aggravating factor of <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of
  law</span> (admitted 1989) is present. The board agreed that the mitigating factors present are absence of a prior
  disciplinary record, absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, and personal or emotional problems (due to the death
  of respondent's mother in 2002; however, this relates only to his failure to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation). The board found the hearing committee erred in finding the following mitigating factors are present:
  full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board and a cooperative attitude toward the proceedings, and
  remorse.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering this court's prior jurisprudence,<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3"
  id="fnref3">3</a> the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six months,
  followed by one year of supervised probation. The board also recommended that respondent attend the Louisiana State
  Bar Association's Ethics School, provide an accounting to Ms. Thompson, and return any unearned fees to Ms. Thompson.
  Finally, the board recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs of these proceedings. Neither respondent
  nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters fall within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316
  (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In cases in which the lawyer does not answer the formal charges, the factual allegations of those
  charges are deemed admitted. Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). Thus, the ODC bears no additional burden to prove
  the factual allegations contained in the formal charges after those charges have been deemed admitted. However, the
  language of § 11(E)(3) does not encompass legal conclusions that flow from the factual allegations. If the legal
  conclusion the ODC seeks to prove (i.e., a violation of a specific rule) is not readily apparent from the deemed
  admitted facts, additional evidence may need to be submitted in order to prove the legal conclusions that flow from
  the admitted factual allegations. <span class="cite">In re: Donnan, 01-3058 (La. 1/10/03),
  <a href="2003-01-10_2001-3058.htm">838 So. 2d 715</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The deemed admitted facts establish that respondent neglected Mr. Windham's legal matter,
  allowing the case to be dismissed. He also failed to inform his client of the dismissal or take remedial action.
  Furthermore, respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the Windham matter, making it
  necessary for the ODC to subpoena him to obtain his response to the complaint. In the Thompson matter, respondent
  accepted $2,000 from his client to file her appeal. He was fired before he filed the appeal, yet he failed to refund
  the unearned fee. The record supports a finding that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged
  in the formal charges. Having found this professional misconduct, the sole issue presented for our consideration is
  the appropriate sanction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain
  high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct.
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La.
  1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses
  involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent violated duties owed to his clients and as a professional. He acted knowingly, causing
  actual harm to both Mr. Windham and Ms. Thompson. Under the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the
  baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is suspension.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Aggravating factors supported by the record are multiple offenses, substantial experience in the
  practice of law, and indifference to making restitution. The record supports the mitigating factors found by the
  board, namely the absence of a prior disciplinary record, absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, and personal or
  emotional problems stemming from the death of respondent's mother in 2002.<a name="fnref4" class="fn" href="#fn4"
  id="fnref4">4</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Our prior jurisprudence reveals that the sanction for misconduct similar to respondent's is a
  period of suspension in the range of six to eighteen months.<a name="fnref5" class="fn" href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a>
  The sanction recommended by the board in this case is within this range, albeit on the lower end, but is appropriate
  considering the mitigating factors present. Accordingly, we will accept the board's recommendation and suspend
  respondent for six months, followed by one year of supervised probation. Respondent shall also attend the Louisiana
  State Bar Association's Ethics School, provide an accounting to Ms. Thompson, and return the entire $2,000 fee to Ms.
  Thompson.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that James L. Yates, Louisiana Bar Roll number 19841, be and he hereby is
  suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months. Following his suspension, respondent shall be placed
  on supervised probation for a period of one year. It is further ordered that respondent shall attend the Louisiana
  State Bar Association's Ethics School, provide an accounting to Ms. Thompson, and make restitution to Ms. Thompson in
  the amount of $2,000.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's
  judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> The fee agreement between respondent
  and Ms. Thompson indicated that $1,000 of the $2,000 fee would be kept in respondent's trust account to be paid out
  when the appeal was filed. Nevertheless, in a May 22, 2002 sworn statement, responded indicated that he had "more
  than earned the $2,000 fee" by doing research and looking over Ms. Thompson's case.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">2</a> In his July 24, 2003 sworn statement,
  respondent indicated he had stopped practicing law in mid-2002 after his mother passed away. Presumably, respondent's
  mother's death is the personal or emotional problems to which the committee is referring.</p>
