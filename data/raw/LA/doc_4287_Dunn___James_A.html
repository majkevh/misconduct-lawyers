<p><font size="3"><b> UNDERLYING FACTS </b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font size="3">In February, 1990, respondent was retained by Elaine and Trenise Williams to complete and file an act of sale on their behalf.&nbsp; Despite repeated requests, respondent did not communicate with his clients and did not file the act of sale until February, 1993, resulting in the improper assessment of property taxes to his clients.<br>
</font><span class="PlainText"><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In February of 1994, respondent was retained again by Mrs. Williams to file and complete her claim for personal bankruptcy, and in October, 1995, to handle her divorce.&nbsp; Respondent failed to complete these matters and failed to communicate with his client.</font></span><span class="CITE"> (FN1)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font size="3"> In an unrelated matter, respondent was retained, in November, 1994, by Janelle Ogden-Brown to file and complete a divorce on her behalf.&nbsp; Although respondent did some work on Ms. Ogden-Brown's case, he failed to obtain a divorce for her, failed to communicate with&nbsp; his client and failed to account for or&nbsp; return an unearned fee.</font></p>
<p><span class="PlainText"><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In connection with both the Williams complaint and the Ogden-Brown complaint, </font></span><font size="3">the ODC requested responses from respondent.&nbsp; Respondent failed to comply with these requests until subpoenas were issued compelling his cooperation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On December 30, 1996, the ODC instituted formal charges against respondent.&nbsp; The hearing committee conducted a formal hearing, but respondent failed to attend, despite receiving notice.&nbsp; Subsequently, respondent filed a post-hearing memorandum in which he admitted to the alleged misconduct.&nbsp; In mitigation, he stated his negligence was grounded in depression which he had been experiencing for eight to ten years and that his problems were exacerbated by his denial that anything was wrong.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On September 11, 1997, the <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Ab4ea?an=JD_HC9693 --##'>hearing committee</a> filed its findings and recommendation with the disciplinary board.&nbsp; The committee found respondent admitted that he failed to complete the services for which he was retained, failed to communicate with his clients and knowingly ignored matters for which he was retained, all in violation of the professional rules as charged.&nbsp; As to injuries to his clients, the committee found Mrs. Williams had an outstanding tax bill, plus penalties and interest, which she is incapable of paying.&nbsp; Ms. Ogden-Brown was deprived of $341 paid for the divorce because, although respondent prepared the papers, he failed to timely pursue the matter. </font><span class="CITE">(FN2)</span></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Relying on the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Discipline, the committee determined the baseline sanction was suspension when a lawyer knowingly fails to perform a service for a client and causes injury to that client.&nbsp; Moreover, it stated suspension was appropriate when a lawyer engages in conduct in violation of the duty owed to the profession and especially when a lawyer has previously been reprimanded for similar conduct in the past.&nbsp; While noting the aggravating factor of respondent's prior disciplinary history, </font><span class="CITE">(FN3)</span> the committee&nbsp; recognized as mitigating factors respondent's treatment for depression and absence of a selfish motive.&nbsp; Based on these considerations, the committee recommended respondent be suspended for a period of one year and one day with all but six months and one day deferred.&nbsp; It further recommended respondent be placed on two years supervised probation, and that he be ordered to make restitution and seek psychological treatment.</p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the hearing before the disciplinary board, respondent and disciplinary counsel agreed to allow further mitigating evidence regarding respondent's medical condition to be placed in the record.&nbsp; In connection with this agreement, the ODC propounded five questions to respondent's doctor, Dr. Stanley Roskind of Methodist Behavioral Resources.&nbsp; In response, Dr. Roskind provided a one page hand-written report confirming that respondent suffers from recurrent major depression, but indicating that his prognosis was good if he followed the recommended treatment protocol.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On March 23, 1998, the disciplinary board filed its recommendation with this court.&nbsp; After&nbsp;&nbsp; considering the medical evidence, the board concluded that respondent's longstanding depression, as well as his remorse and absence of selfish motive, should be considered as mitigating factors which &quot;weigh heavily in consideration of the disciplinary action to be taken.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, the disciplinary board deviated from the recommendation of the hearing committee and proposed that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year and one day, but that all of this suspension be deferred pending successful completion of a one-year supervised probationary period subject to conditions. </font><span class="CITE">(FN4)</span></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ODC filed a timely objection to this recommendation.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Accordingly, pursuant to </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">, the matter was set for oral argument.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since respondent has essentially admitted all the allegations against him, the sole issue raised is the appropriateness of the sanction.&nbsp; We agree with the disciplinary board that weight should be given to the mitigating factors in this case, including respondent's demonstration of remorse for his actions and his recurrent depression.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the fact remains that respondent's misconduct caused tangible harm to his clients, in that it caused Mrs. Williams to pay additional property taxes and delayed Mrs. Ogden-Brown's divorce.&nbsp; This factor, combined with respondent's prior disciplinary record, justifies some period of actual suspension in this case.&nbsp; Accordingly, we find a suspension from the practice of law for a period of one year, with all but six months deferred, followed by a two year period of supervised probation, is appropriate discipline under these facts.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>DECREE</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, oral argument and briefs, it is the decision of this court that respondent, James A. Dunn, Jr., be </font>suspended <font size="3">from the practice of law for a period of </font>one year, with all but six months of this suspension deferred.<font size="3">&nbsp; Following the completion of the active portion of this suspension, respondent shall be placed on </font>supervised probation <font size="3">for a </font>period of two years, subject to those conditions<font size="3"> recommended by the disciplinary board, except that the first condition is modified to provide that respondent shall present proof to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel that he has made restitution or good faith efforts at restitution.&nbsp; All costs of this matter are assessed against respondent.</font></p>
