<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from one count of formal charges filed against respondent, Gilmer P. Hingle of Monroe, Louisiana, by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;).&nbsp; The charges allege respondent violated </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.2'></a>(c)<font size="3"> (counseling a client to engage in conduct which the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent), </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.2'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a>(d)<font size="3"> (failing to consult with client on relevant limitations on the lawyer's conduct), </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE3.4'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a><font size="3">(b) (falsification of evidence), </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a><font size="3">(a) (violating Rules of Professional Conduct), </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a><font size="3">(b) (committing a criminal act), </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a><font size="3">(c) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud deceit or misrepresentation) and </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a><font size="3">(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</font><p>
<p><font size="3"><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1990, respondent represented Frank and Irma Feeback, owners of a used car dealership, in connection with criminal charges of filing false documents and theft by fraud.&nbsp; The charges against the Feebacks arose from a complaint filed by Linda Kay King, a former employee of the dealership.&nbsp; Ms. King alleged that the Feebacks submitted falsified title applications to the state in an attempt to defraud the state.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prior to the filing of the criminal charges, the Feebacks received an anonymous letter.&nbsp; The writer of the letter claimed to have information that would incriminate the Feebacks and its implied intent was to extort money from the Feebacks.&nbsp; After they were charged, the Feebacks gave the letter to respondent, and indicated that based on their own investigation, they believed the writer of the letter was Ms. King.&nbsp; Respondent discussed this letter with the district attorney;&nbsp; however, the district attorney did not take any action regarding the letter.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subsequently, Ms. King, who was experiencing financial difficulties, met with respondent.&nbsp; According to respondent, Ms. King implied at this meeting that if the Feebacks paid her debts, she would not testify against them.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Following this meeting, respondent prepared two affidavits.&nbsp; In the first, the Feebacks agreed not to hold Ms. King liable for any harm she may have caused them, and not to seek criminal or other prosecution against Ms. King.&nbsp; The affidavit also stated that Ms. King would aid in the Feebacks' defense and testify as to the truth in exchange for the Feebacks providing &quot;financial aid&quot; to her by assuming her debts at Norwest Financial, Premier Bank, and Central Bank.&nbsp; This affidavit was signed by Frank and Irma Feeback on April 6, 1991.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the second affidavit, Ms. King declared that the Feebacks never requested or directed her or any other person to forge or falsify documents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms. King signed this affidavit on April 7, 1991.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Following the signing of these affidavits, respondent arranged for Ms. King's debts to be assigned to Creative Mortgage Funding, Inc., a Louisiana corporation incorporated by respondent for the use of another client.</font><span class="CITE"><font size="1">1</font><font size="3">&nbsp; </font></span>Brenda Hicks, respondent's secretary and legal assistant at the time, testified that respondent instructed her to pick up money from the Feebacks, purchase cashier's checks under the name of Creative Mortgage Funding, and issue the checks to Premier Bank, Norwest Financial, and Central Bank.&nbsp; Ms. Hicks then delivered the cashier's checks to the financial institutions as payment of Ms. King's debts<span class="CITE">.<font size="1">2</font></span></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondent then filed a motion to quash the Feebacks' indictments and attached a copy of Ms. King's April 7, 1991 affidavit.&nbsp; In response, the district attorney investigated the motive behind Ms. King's affidavit, and discovered evidence linking respondent to the payment of Ms. King's debts.&nbsp; When the district attorney confronted respondent with this evidence, he stated that a friend's corporation had purchased the loans in a legitimate transaction.&nbsp; However, respondent admitted that Ms. King had not made any payments on the loan.&nbsp; Respondent also told the district attorney, &quot;[i]f you as prosecutors can offer immunity to a witness to get him to cooperate, why can't I offer him money?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font>As a result of this investigation, the Ouachita Parish Grand Jury indicted respondent, charging him with the offense of public bribery, in<font size="3"> violation of </font><span class="CITE">La.&nbsp; R.S. 14:118.<font size="1"> 3</font><font size="3">&nbsp; </font></span> After a trial, respondent was convicted as charged.&nbsp; The trial court sentenced respondent to serve two years at hard labor, suspended the sentence and placed him on supervised probation for a period of three years.&nbsp; As a special condition of probation, the trial court ordered respondent to serve 180 days in the parish jail<span class="CITE">.<font size="1">4</font><font size="3"> </font></span>&nbsp; Respondent's conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal, and this court denied his request for review.&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><font size="3"><b><i>State v. Hingle</i></b></font><font size="3">, 28,260 (La.App.2d Cir.6/26/96), 677 So.2d </font><font size="3">603, writ denied, 96-1969 (La.1/10/97), 685 So.2d 141.</font></span></p>
<p><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After respondent was indicted in the criminal matter, the ODC filed a motion for interim suspension in this court.&nbsp; On May 5, 1995, this court granted the motion and placed respondent on interim suspension pending further orders.&nbsp; </font><span class="CITE"><font size="3"><b><i>In Re Hingle</i></b></font><font size="3">, 95-0803 (La.5/5/95), 654 So.2d 316.</font></span></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On May 17, 1995, the ODC filed formal charges against respondent based on his conviction.&nbsp; Respondent filed a timely answer, and the matter was set for formal hearing before the hearing committee.&nbsp; Respondent&nbsp; was represented by counsel at the hearing, and he testified on his own behalf.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to respondent, his conviction really arose from his attempt to represent his clients to the fullest.&nbsp; Respondent asserted that his clients were the victim of Ms. King's extortion attempt.&nbsp; Although he showed the letter to the district attorney and sought assistance from him, the district attorney refused to act.&nbsp; Respondent contended his clients had no alternative but to pay the extortion in order to get Ms. King to tell the truth.&nbsp; While he accepted responsibility for his actions, he maintained his motive was not to help himself but rather to avoid harm to his client. After the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing committee rendered its recommendation to the disciplinary board.&nbsp; Initially, the hearing committee found respondent's conviction for public bribery clearly constituted a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.&nbsp; Regardless of respondent's thought process during the events at issue, the hearing committee concluded that his conviction for public bribery &quot;strikes at the very heart and most essential elements of our legal system....&quot;&nbsp; The committee noted that this court imposed disbarment in similar cases where the respondent was convicted of bribery.&nbsp; </font><span class="CITE">In re Collins, 94-2251 (La.11/18/94), 645 So.2d 1131<font size="3"><b><i>;&nbsp; Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Pitard,</i></b></font><font size="3"> 462 So.2d 178 (La.1985).</font></span>&nbsp; Therefore, the committee <font size="3">recommended respondent be disbarred.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A7171?an=JD_95-DB-019 --##'>disciplinary board</a> concurred in the factual findings of the <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Ac4eb?an=JD_HC9519 --##'>hearing committee</a>.&nbsp; The disciplinary board noted that it was particularly troubled by respondent's total lack of remorse for his actions, pointing out that despite the fact he had been convicted of a felony, respondent maintained his actions were legal and akin to a prosecutor offering a witness immunity for testimony.&nbsp; After reviewing the aggravating and mitigating factors,</font><font size="1">5</font><font size="3">&nbsp; the board recommended respondent be disbarred.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondent filed a timely objection in this court to the disciplinary board's recommendation, and the matter was set for oral argument pursuant to </font></p>
<p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondent argues the motive for actions in this case was not for personal gain, but rather to avoid harm to his clients.&nbsp; However, in </font><span class="CITE"><font size="3"><b><i>Pitard</i></b></font></span><font size="3">, we rejected </font><font size="3">a similar defense, concluding that the issue of specific intent was established in the underlying criminal proceeding.&nbsp; As in that case, even though respondent may not have viewed his conduct as criminal, he clearly intended to influence the conduct of a potential witness.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondent further argues that any viable alternatives to paying Ms. King were foreclosed by the district attorney's failure to act in response to the evidence of extortion.&nbsp; While it may be true that the district attorney's action placed respondent in a difficult position, the court of appeal, in affirming respondent's criminal conviction, specifically rejected this argument and found respondent had other legal alternatives to bribery available to him, such as using the evidence of the extortion to impeach Ms. King at trial, or reporting her conduct to the state police.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like the hearing committee, we find that respondent's conviction for bribery of a witness strikes at the very heart of our legal system.&nbsp; Most disturbing is the fact that even in his brief to this court, respondent fails to recognize the serious ramifications of his conduct, and continues to compare his actions to those of a prosecutor offering immunity or a plea bargain.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Based on our review of the record, we conclude, as we did in </font><span class="CITE"><font size="3"><b><i>Pitard</i></b></font></span><font size="3">, that the </font><font size="3">only appropriate sanction for respondent's conduct is </font>disbarment.</p>
<p><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary&nbsp; board, the briefs and oral arguments of the parties and the record filed herein, it is the decision of the court that the recommendation of the disciplinary board be adopted.&nbsp; Accordingly, it is ordered that the name of </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Gilmer P. Hingle be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice in the State of Louisiana be revoked.&nbsp; It is further ordered that the respondent make full restitution, plus legal interest, to his former clients.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Costs of these proceedings, in the amount of $305.80, are assessed against respondent.</font></p>
