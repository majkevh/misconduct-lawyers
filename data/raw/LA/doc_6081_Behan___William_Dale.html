in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, and

seeks to permanently resign from the practice of law in lieu of discipline. The 
ODC has concurred in respondent’s petition.</p>

Resignation from the Practice of Law filed by William Dale Behan, Louisiana Bar 
Roll number 24959, and the concurrence thereto filed by the ODC,</p>

permanent resignation in lieu of discipline be and is hereby granted, pursuant 
to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 20.1 and Rule 5.5(c) of the Rules of Professional
