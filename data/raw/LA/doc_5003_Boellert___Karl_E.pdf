  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 06-B-0482</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: KARL E. BOELLERT</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that
  respondent engaged in a sexual relationship with a client. Prior to the filing of formal charges, respondent and the
  ODC submitted a joint petition for consent discipline in which respondent admitted that his conduct violated Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.7</span> (conflicts of interest) and <span class="Rules">2.1</span> (a lawyer shall exercise
  independent professional judgment in representing a client) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Having reviewed the
  petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Karl E. Boellert,
  Louisiana Bar Roll number 3212, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year and one day. This
  suspension shall be deferred in its entirety, subject to respondent's successful completion of a two-year period of
  probation governed by the terms and conditions set forth in the Petition for Consent Discipline. Any failure of
  respondent to comply with the conditions of probation, or any misconduct during the probationary period, may be
  grounds for making the deferred suspension executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
