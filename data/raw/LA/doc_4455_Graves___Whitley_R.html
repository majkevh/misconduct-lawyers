<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 01-B-0922</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: WHITLEY R. GRAVES</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p>PER CURIAM <a href="#asterisk">*</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary proceeding arises from a joint petition for consent 
discipline filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) and respondent, 
Whitley R. Graves, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of 
Louisiana.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent, an assistant district attorney for the Parish of Bossier, 
represented the State of Louisiana in a capital case pending before this court, 
<i>State v. Casey</i>, 99-KA-0023. Supreme Court Rule XXVIII, § 4 requires the district 
attorney’s office to file a Sentence Review Memorandum in all capital cases 
within thirty days from the time the defense’s brief is filed in this court. 
Respondent did not file a Sentence Review Memorandum by this deadline, which was 
April 29, 1999.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On June 3, 1999, this court sent a demand for brief and Sentence Review 
Memorandum to the district attorney’s office. Respondent, on behalf of the 
State, filed a motion for extension of time to file his brief and Sentence 
Review Memorandum. On June 14, 1999, this court granted respondent an additional 
sixty days to file a brief and Sentence Review Memorandum.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent eventually filed a brief in this matter on October 18, 1999, but 
did not file a Sentence Review Memorandum. On November 29, 1999, this court 
personally informed respondent before beginning oral arguments in the matter 
that he was required to file a Sentence Review Memorandum. Respondent told this 
court he had a copy of the memorandum with him and would check with the clerk’s 
office after arguments to take care of the matter.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After one month, respondent had still not filed a Sentence Review Memorandum. 
Accordingly, on December 28, 1999, this court ordered respondent to show cause 
why he should not be held in contempt for failing to file the Sentence Review 
Memorandum in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent appeared before this court on January 18, 2000, claiming that he 
had not received any notice that he was required to file a Sentence Review 
Memorandum, despite the order dated June 14, 1999 from this court and despite 
being personally informed by the court before oral arguments on November 29, 
1999 of his obligations under Rule XXVIII. Respondent blamed his failure to file 
the Sentence Review Memorandum on his poor health, absences and incompetent 
staff. The Sentence Review Memorandum was finally filed in this court on January 
18, 2000.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On February 11, 2000, this court issued an order holding respondent in 
contempt of court. <i>State v. Casey</i>, 99-0023 (La. 2/11/00), 775 So. 2d 1043. After 
reviewing the facts, we stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based upon the foregoing, we hold that Whitley Graves willfully disobeyed a 
lawful order of this court by failing to file the required Sentence Review 
Memorandum in a timely manner and, thus, hold him in contempt. Accordingly, we 
fine him $250.00 and a copy of this opinion will be forwarded to the Office of 
Disciplinary Counsel.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Petition for Consent Discipline</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Pursuant to our order, the ODC instituted an investigation into the matter. 
Prior to the institution of formal charges, respondent and the ODC entered into 
a petition for consent discipline. The parties stipulated to the facts, as set 
forth in this court’s opinion in the contempt matter. Respondent acknowledged 
his conduct was in violation of Rules <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.3 --#">1.3</a></span> (neglect) and <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a></span>(d) (engaging in 
conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct. As mitigating factors, the parties noted respondent’s 
absence of a prior disciplinary record, full and free disclosure to the 
disciplinary board and cooperative attitude toward the proceedings, character 
and reputation, imposition of other penalties or sanctions, and remorse. 
Considering these factors, the parties proposed respondent be suspended for a 
period of less than one year, fully deferred, subject to a two-year period of 
supervised probation.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-094.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board found respondent knowingly caused injury to the 
integrity of the legal system because his actions resulted in a nine-month delay 
in the resolution of the Casey matter and evidenced a lack of respect for the 
court’s orders and instructions. The board further recognized respondent misled 
this court by representing that he had a copy of the memorandum with him and 
would file it after oral argument.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, the board agreed that there were 
numerous mitigating factors in this case which justified a downward deviation 
from the baseline sanction of a suspension. Accordingly, the board recommended 
adoption of the proposed discipline of a nine-month suspension, totally 
deferred, subject to a two-year period of supervised probation. One board member 
dissented, concluding a two-month period of actual suspension was warranted 
under the facts.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Although this matter arises from a petition for consent discipline, Supreme 
Court Rule XIX, § 20(B) provides that the extent of discipline to be imposed is 
subject to review. In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that 
disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, 
protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future 
misconduct. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The 
discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness 
of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 
1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The facts in this case are undisputed. Respondent failed to comply with the 
orders of this court in connection with the filing of the Sentence Review 
Memorandum. His conduct delayed resolution of the underlying criminal 
proceeding, causing injury to the integrity of the legal process. Respondent’s 
actions reveal a disturbing disregard for his professional obligations and a 
lack of respect for the authority of this court which is inappropriate for any 
member of the bar, especially an assistant district attorney. The baseline 
sanction for this misconduct is clearly a suspension. See Standard 5.22 of the 
American Bar Association’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (“[s]uspension 
is generally appropriate when a lawyer in an official or governmental position 
knowingly fails to follow proper procedures or rules, and causes injury or 
potential injury to a party or to the integrity of the legal process”).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Nonetheless, we recognize the existence of mitigating factors which justify a 
deviation from the baseline sanction. Respondent has no prior disciplinary 
record and has cooperated with disciplinary authorities, as evidenced by his 
petition for consent discipline. Respondent’s conduct has been the subject of 
other penalties, in the form of this court’s contempt judgment. Finally, 
respondent has expressed sincere remorse for his actions by sending letters of 
apology to a member of this court, as well as to the clerk of court.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">These mitigating factors justify imposition of a fully deferred nine-month 
suspension, subject to a two-year period of probation. Accordingly, we will 
accept the petition for consent discipline.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and 
considering the record filed herein, it is ordered that Whitley R. Graves be 
suspended from the practice of law in the State of Louisiana for nine months. 
This suspension shall be fully deferred, subject to a two-year period of 
supervised probation. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against 
respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal 
interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s 
judgment until paid.</p>
