<br>
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>PER CURIAM.</p>
<p>***************************************************************************<br>
<span class="BodyText">This action involves consideration of two consolidated disciplinary proceedings.&nbsp; The Office of Disciplinary Counsel brought formal charges against Robert J. Fabacher on January 19,, 1993.&nbsp; Fabacher was charged with having been convicted of serious criminal conduct<font size="3">'</font></span><span class="footnotereference"><font size="1" color="#008000">1</font></span><font size="3" color="#000000"> in violation of </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE3.4'></a> (a) (f) , and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a> (a-d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct<font size="3" color="#000000"> which adversely reflected upon Fabacher's moral fitness to practice law under this Court's</font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s19'></a><p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On May 19, 1993, a hearing on the charges against Fabacher was held.&nbsp; The evidence revealed that a federal grand jury and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were investigating the alleged criminal activity of Fabacher and two other individuals.&nbsp; Although aware of the FBI's investigation, Fabacher asked the wife of one of the individuals not to talk to the federal authorities.&nbsp; As evidence of mitigation, Fabacher testified that he was suffering from severe financial, marital, and alcoholic problems.&nbsp; Fabacher was placed on </font>Interim Suspension<font size="3"> by order of this Court on October 29, 1992, because of his conviction on the obstruction of justice charge.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fabacher was later charged with three counts of failure to respond to separate subpoenas issued by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel in three separate matters under investigation by that office.&nbsp; These subpoenas ordered Fabacher to, appear for deposition and produce requested documents.&nbsp; Because Fabacher failed to file </font><span class="BodyText">an answer to these charges, the Disciplinary Counsel contended that the charges were deemed admitted pursuant to this Courts<a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s11'></a><font size="3"> </font> A hearing van hold an November 12, 1991.&nbsp; Fabacher did not appear.&nbsp; After the Disciplinary Counsel presented a prima facie case, the<font size="3"> <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Ab923?an=JD_hc9302 --##'>Hearing Committee recommended disbarment.</a></font><p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font>On November 19, 1992, a hearing was hold during which Fabacher presented evidence of mitigation to excuse his failure to cooperate with Disciplinary Counsel.&nbsp; <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Ab916?an=JD_HC9128 --##'><font size="3">The Hearing Committee</font></a><font size="3"> </font>concluded that Fabacher had not intentionally ignored the orders of Disciplinary Counsel but was in a physical and mental state *which precluded him from dealing rationally under the circumstances.&quot; This condition was primarily the result of excessive alcohol intake, coupled with mental depression occasioned by severe financial and marital difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font>On December 13, 1993, the<a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A6438?an=JD_93-db-002 --##'> </a><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A63ec?an=JD_91-DB-028 --##'><font size="3">Disciplinary Board heard the consolidated case against Fabacher. </font></a><font size="3"><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A6438?an=JD_93-db-002 --##'> </a></font>On<a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A6438?an=JD_93-db-002 --##'><font size="3"> March 24, 1994 the Board f iled its report</font></a><font size="3"> </font>with this Court in which it recommended that Fabacher be disbarred and required to comply with the specific requirements of this Court's<font size="3"> </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s24'></a>upon<font size="3"> </font>consideration for readmission<font size="3">.</font><span class="footnotereference"><font size="1" color="#008000"> 2</font></span><font size="3" color="#000000"> It also recommended that Fabacher be required to pay all costs of these proceedings pursuant to</font><font size="3" color="#000000">.&nbsp; The Board concluded that because Fabacher&quot;s conduct &quot;falls well below the standard the profession seeks to uphold,&quot; disbarment was appropriate.&nbsp; First, although recognizing that Fabacher's conviction was a misdemeanor and not a felony, the Board noted that Fabacherfs conduct was still criminal and involved </font><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">d</font>ishonesty with an attempt to interfere with the administration of justice. Second, the Board cited to ABA Standard S 6.22 which declares&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that &quot;suspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a court order or rule, and there is injury or potential injury to a client or party, or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding.&quot; le&amp; A.B.A. Standard S 6.22. The Board concluded that Fabacher's failure to comply with the subpoenas issued by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel,, coupled with other incidents of noncooperation and his<font size="3"> </font>criminal conviction for witness tampering, warrant disbarment.</span><p>
<p><span class="BodyText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fabacher was served notice of this recommendation and its filing with this Court on May 19,, 1994,, and has not filed any objection or other documents in opposition with this Court.</span></p>
