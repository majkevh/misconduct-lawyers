  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE:  LARRY D. JEFFERSON</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NUMBER 01-DB-002</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">AMENDED RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a petition for consent discipline, after
  the institution of formal charges, by Larry D. Jefferson ("Respondent") of Monroe, Louisiana, an attorney licensed to
  practice law in the State of Louisiana. For reasons stated below, the Disciplinary Board accepts the petition and
  orders a public reprimand be issued against Respondent.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On January 4, 2001, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") filed one count of formal charges
  against the Respondent, alleging that he failed and/or refused to pay a cost assessment imposed upon him by order of
  the Louisiana Supreme Court in connection with a judiciary commission matter. Thereafter, Respondent filed an answer
  to the formal charges denying that he was guilty of professional misconduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On April 30, 2001, Respondent filed a petition for consent discipline, wherein he tendered a
  conditional admission to the alleged misconduct and proposed that he be issued a public reprimand. ODC has filed a
  concurrence in the petition, and the parties have filed a stipulation of facts. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On June 28, 2001, a panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter. The parties waived
  appearances; therefore, oral argument was not conducted.  The Disciplinary Board issued a ruling in this matter on
  July 30, 2001, accepting the petition for consent discipline filed by the Respondent and finding that the Respondent
  had violated Rules of Professional Conduct <span class="Rules">8.2(b)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span>,
  Supreme Court <span class="Rules">Rule XIX, Section 9(c)</span> and Supreme Court <span class="Rules">Rule XXIII,
  Section 22</span>.  The Board ordered that the Respondent receive a public reprimand. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On August 10, 2001, ODC filed a motion to modify the Board's ruling, requesting that the Board
  amend its ruling to reflect the accurate rule violation consented to by the Respondent, namely Supreme Court Rule
  XXIII, Section 22.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle"><b>STIPULATED FACTS</b></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The stipulated facts in this matter incorporate the substance of the formal charges and provide
  the following information:</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent formerly served as a judge in the Monroe City Court. Allegations of judicial
  misconduct were lodged against Respondent by the Judiciary Commission urging that the Louisiana Supreme Court remove
  Respondent from office and order that he reimburse and pay to the Commission all costs incurred in its investigation
  and prosecution of the matter.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In an opinion lodged on January 19, 2000, the Court found that Respondent's conduct in his
  capacity as a judge violated Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct as well as standards articulated in Article 5,
  Section 25(c) of the Louisiana State Constitution. The Court's order removed Respondent from office and declared his
  office vacant. The Court further assessed Respondent with costs in the amount of $4,333.00.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Following release of the Court's original opinion, Respondent sought a rehearing, which was
  denied on February 8, 2000. At that time, the judgment against Respondent became final. Additionally, by
  correspondence dated February 23, 2000, counsel for the Judiciary Commission placed Respondent on notice that he was
  required to promptly remit payment of the costs.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">While Respondent knew of the Court's original decision casting him for these costs, his failure
  to pay the cost assessments was based on a negligent belief that he could delay doing so while challenging the orders
  of the Court under theories of the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment due process and equal protection violations he believed
  may have occurred. Respondent ultimately paid all costs to the Commission on September 11, 2000.<b> </b></p>

  <p class="headingstyle"><b>PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</b></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">A review of the petition, along with the motion to modify the Board's ruling of July 30, 2001 and
  the remainder of the record, reveals that the Respondent admits to violating the procedural provisions of Supreme
  Court Rule XXIII, Section 22.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" class="fn" id="_ednref1">[i]</a> Respondent proposes
  that a formal public reprimand be issued. ODC has concurred in the proposed sanction.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated the procedural provisions of Supreme
  Court Rule XXIII, Section 22.  The Board must accept that Respondent has violated this rule. 
  <span class="cite"><i>In re Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96); <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So.2d
  272</a></span>. Given the violation of this rule, the Board is left to determine if the proposed sanction is
  appropriate.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1)  whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2)<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">   </span> whether the lawyer acted intentionally,
    knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon a review of the record, the Board finds that Respondent has negligently violated
  duties owed to the legal system. Respondent's failure to promptly pay the costs due the Judiciary Commission caused
  injury to that agency.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The parties do not list any mitigating or aggravating factors. Based upon a review of the
  documents submitted, the Board is unable to find sufficient information to support the finding of any such
  factors.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Finally, the proposed sanction is in keeping with the ABA Standards<a href="#_edn2"
  name="_ednref2" class="fn" id="_ednref2">[ii]</a> and prior jurisprudence.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" class="fn"
  id="_ednref3">[iii]</a></p>

  <p class="headingstyle"><b>RULING</b> </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the petition for consent discipline be accepted, and
  that a public reprimand be issued against the Respondent, Larry D. Jefferson. The Board also orders that all costs
  and expenses of these proceedings be assessed to Respondent, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from
  the date of this order until paid.</p>
