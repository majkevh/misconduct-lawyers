  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 02-B-2680</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: EDDIE G. CRAWFORD</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from four counts of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Eddie G. Crawford, an attorney licensed to practice law in
  Louisiana, but who has been suspended by various orders of this court since 1994. Despite the clear orders of this
  court prohibiting him from practicing law, respondent has continued to engage in the unauthorized practice of law.
  Finding such a blatant disregard for the orders of this court to be unacceptable, we now permanently disbar
  respondent.</p>

  <h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was admitted to practice in 1983. His history of professional misconduct began in
  1991, when he was admonished on three separate occasions for failing to cooperate with the ODC. In 1992, respondent
  was admonished on four separate occasions. Three of these admonitions involved failure to cooperate; the fourth
  admonition was for engaging in conduct involving fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 1994, we suspended respondent for a period of ninety days for misconduct arising out of his
  representation of a client in a succession matter, including failure to communicate with the client and failure to
  promptly refund an unearned fee. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Crawford</i>, 93-3148 (La. 9/16/94),
  <a href="1994-09-16_1993-3148.htm">643 So. 2d 135</a>.</span> Because this suspension was for less than one year,
  respondent was eligible for reinstatement upon compliance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 23; however, respondent did
  not seek reinstatement.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Approximately six months later, we again addressed disciplinary infractions committed by
  respondent. This time, we suspended respondent for a period of six months based on failure to act with diligence,
  failure to communicate, and commingling of client funds. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Crawford</i>, 94-2960 (La.
  3/10/95), <a href="1995-03-10_1994-2690.htm">651 So.2d 1338</a></span>. Again, respondent did not seek reinstatement
  procedures.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's most recent appearance before this court came in 1997, at which time we suspended
  respondent for a period of one year and one day for neglecting client matters and failing to advise his clients that
  he had been suspended during the course of his representation. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Crawford</i>, 97-1002
  (La. 9/19/97), <a href="1997-09-19_1997-1002.htm">699 So. 2d 379</a></span>. Respondent has not applied to this court
  for formal reinstatement pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Thus, since September, 1994, respondent has been continuously suspended from the practice of
  law.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <h3>Count I - Caswell Succession Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In late 1997, the heirs of Virgil Caswell, who were California residents, paid respondent an
  advance fee of $1,800 to institute succession proceedings in Louisiana. At the time respondent accepted the fee, he
  was suspended from the practice of law. While respondent advised one heir and the spouse of another heir of his
  suspension, he failed to inform the several remaining heirs of this fact.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As the matter proceeded, respondent periodically communicated to the heirs that he was diligently
  pursuing the matter. In June, 1998, respondent contacted one heir, Tommie Jean Cain, and indicated he was completing
  the succession matter and needed additional funds. Ms. Cain forwarded respondent a cashier's check in the amount of
  $3,000. Respondent deposited the funds in his family joint bank account. Upon learning the succession proceedings
  were never instituted and that respondent was not licensed to practice law, Ms. Cain filed a complaint with the
  ODC.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In his response to the complaint, respondent agreed to provide restitution to the heirs; however,
  he failed to do so.</p>

  <h3>Count II - Jones Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In August, 1997, Harry Jones retained respondent to represent his interests in a personal injury
  matter against State Farm Insurance Company. At the time he was retained, respondent was suspended from the practice
  of law, but failed to inform his client or State Farm of his suspension from the practice of law. Ultimately,
  respondent negotiated a settlement on behalf of his client. State Farm issued a check in the amount of $5,266, which
  was made out to "Harry Jones &amp; His Attorney Eddie Crawford." Respondent and his client each endorsed the check.
  Respondent deducted his legal fee and disbursed the balance of the funds to his client.</p>

  <h3>Count III - Gillam Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In December, 1997, Carolyn C. Gillam retained respondent for $750 to institute proceedings
  relative to the succession of her brother. At the time he accepted the representation, respondent was suspended from
  the practice of law. Respondent failed to undertake any legal work in the matter for over two years. Dissatisfied
  with respondent's inaction, Ms. Gillam made numerous requests for a refund of the unearned fee. On each occasion,
  respondent promised to return the funds, but never did so.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, Ms. Gillam filed a complaint with the ODC. In his response to the complaint,
  respondent advised the ODC he intended to return the money within thirty days. However, respondent has yet to provide
  any restitution to Ms. Gillam.</p>

  <h3>Count IV - Kees Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In December, 1997, Edwena Ann Coleman Kees retained respondent for $750 to institute proceedings
  relative to the succession of her father. Respondent was suspended from the practice of law at the time he accepted
  the representation. Respondent had neglected to undertake any legal work in the matter for over two years.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Ms. Kees eventually filed a complaint with the ODC and sought a return of the unearned fee. In
  response to the ODC's request for information, respondent asserted he would contact his client regarding the matter.
  There is no indication respondent ever did so, or that he paid any restitution to Ms. Kees.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Following its investigation, the ODC filed formal charges against respondent alleging violations
  of Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (lack of diligence), <span class="Rules">1.4(b)</span> (failure to provide
  client sufficient information to participate intelligently in decisions subject of the representation),
  <span class="Rules">1.5(a)</span> (unreasonableness of legal fee), <span class="Rules">1.16(a)(1)</span> (failure to
  withdraw from representation of client when the representation resulted in professional misconduct),
  <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span> (failure to protect client interests upon termination of representation),
  <span class="Rules">4.1</span> (making a false statement of material fact to a third person in the course of a client
  representation), <span class="Rules">5.5(a)</span> (violating disciplinary regulation of another jurisdiction through
  unauthorized practice of law in that jurisdiction), <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> (violating the Rules of
  Professional Conduct), <span class="Rules">8.4(b)</span> (commission of a criminal act adversely reflecting on a
  lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer) and <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct
  involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an answer to the formal charges. While not conceding he engaged in the
  unauthorized practice of law, respondent simply admitted that he was suspended from practice during the times in
  question and had promised to make restitution to his clients.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2001-08-21_01-DB-012.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Following a formal hearing, the committee concluded the ODC proved by clear and convincing
  evidence each of the allegations subject of the formal charges. Based on its findings, the committee recommended that
  respondent be disbarred from the practice of law. One committee member dissented without assigning reasons.
  Respondent's Objection/ODC's Supplemental Memorandum After the hearing committee issued its recommendation,
  respondent filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation of disbarment. In his memorandum, he asserted
  he should not be disbarred but should instead be suspended for an additional period of time, with readmission subject
  to probationary terms.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed a supplemental memorandum with the disciplinary board arguing respondent should be
  permanently disbarred.<a href="#fn1">1</a> In support, the ODC relied on Guidelines 8 and 9 from the <i>Guidelines
  Depicting Conduct Which Might Warrant Permanent Disbarment</i> contained in Appendix E Supreme Court Rule
  XIX.<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was served with a copy of the ODC's supplemental memorandum on permanent disbarment.
  He did not file a response, nor did he seek a remand to the hearing committee for the purpose of introducing
  additional evidence on this issue.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2002-10-30_01-DB-012.htm">Recommendation of the Disciplinary
  Board</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board concurred in the committee's findings that the ODC proved by clear and
  convincing evidence respondent violated the professional rules charged. Specifically, the board concluded
  respondent's "flagrant" unauthorized practice of law confirmed his total disregard of the legal profession and the
  privilege to practice law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In addressing the issue of sanctions, the board found respondent intentionally violated duties
  owed to his clients, the public, and as a professional. The board recognized the Caswell heirs were harmed by the
  cost of the airfare and hotel accommodations it provided to respondent for their first meeting in California, as well
  as the fees to complete the legal work. The board also pointed out Ms. Gillam and Ms. Kees were not refunded their
  respective fees.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board relied on the <i>ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> to conclude the
  appropriate baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is disbarment.<a href="#fn3">3</a> It found the mitigating
  factors of <span class="ABAstandard">full disclosure and cooperation in the disciplinary process</span> are
  significantly outweighed by the aggravating factors, which include respondent's extensive
  <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary record</span>,<a href="#fn4">4</a> <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest
  or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">multiple
  offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerable victims</span> and <span class="ABAstandard">substantial
  experience in the practice of law</span>.<a href="#fn5">5</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Placing emphasis on the aggravating factors, the board recommended that respondent be permanently
  disbarred from the practice of law. One board member dissented to the proposed sanction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an objection to the board's findings and recommendation. Based on such, the
  matter was docketed for briefing and argument in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(G).</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Quaid</i>,
  94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 348</span>;
  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall</i>, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d
  444</a>, 445 (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing
  committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual
  findings. See <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Caulfield</i>, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96),
  <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La.
  3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So.2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">It is undisputed that respondent engaged in multiple instances of unauthorized practice of law in
  violation of the judgments of this court suspending him from practice. In addition, he neglected his client's legal
  matters, failed to refund unearned legal fees and misrepresented his efforts relative to his clients' respective
  legal matters. Finding the charges proven by clear and convincing evidence, we turn to the issue of an appropriate
  sanction for respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In addressing the issue of sanctions, we are mindful that the purpose of disciplinary proceedings
  is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to maintain the appropriate standards of professional conduct, to
  preserve the integrity of the legal profession and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the
  standards of the profession. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Vaughan</i>, 00-1892 (La. 10/27/00),
  <a href="2000-10-27_2000-1892.htm">772 So. 2d 87</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Lain</i>, 00-0148 (La.
  5/26/00), <a href="2000-05-26_2000-0148.htm">760 So. 2d 1152</a></span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Redd</i>, 95-1472 (La. 9/15/95),
  <a href="1995-09-15_1995-1472.htm">660 So. 2d 839</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v.
  Whittington</i>, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The sanctions imposed by this court for unauthorized practice of law are largely dependent on the
  individual circumstances of the case. In general, however, when the attorney has manifested a conscious intent to
  flout the authority of this court by practicing after being prohibited from doing so, we have not hesitated to impose
  disbarment. See, e.g., <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Jones</i>, 99-1036 (La. 10/19/99),
  <a href="1999-10-19_1999-1036.htm">747 So. 2d 1081</a></span> (attorney disbarred for engaging in the unauthorized
  practice of law on four occasions, after being suspended in the past for similar misconduct). The serious nature of
  such actions are underscored by La. R.S. 37:213, in which our legislature has made it a felony to engage in the
  unauthorized practice of law. It was against this backdrop that we included unauthorized practice of law as one of
  the types of conduct that might warrant permanent disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In his filings and argument before this court, respondent does not dispute he engaged in the
  unauthorized practice of law, but asks this court not to permanently disbar him and instead give him a "second
  chance" to remedy the error of his ways.  However, respondent fails to recognize that on three prior occasions, we
  have given him the benefit of the doubt by imposing relatively lenient sanctions, only to have respondent continue to
  engage in misconduct. Respondent's refusal to respect the authority of this court demonstrates he lacks the fitness
  to engage in the practice of law in Louisiana.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">We do not lightly impose the sanction of permanent disbarment. <span class="CITE"><i>In re:
  Lynch</i>, 02-2275 (La. 1/24/03), <a href="2003-01-24_2002-2275.htm">__ So. 2d __</a></span> . Nonetheless, we are
  firmly convinced that we would be remiss in our constitutional duty to regulate the practice of law if we did not
  impose that sanction here. Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board's recommendation and impose permanent
  disbarment.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that the name of Eddie G. Crawford be stricken from the roll of attorneys
  and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked. Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
  24(A), it is further ordered that respondent be permanently prohibited from being readmitted to the practice of law
  in this state. Respondent is ordered to make full restitution to his victims. All costs and expenses in the matter
  are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence
  thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" id="fn1">1</a> The amendments to Supreme Court Rule XIX providing for permanent
  disbarment became effective August 1, 2001. Although the committee filed its recommendation on August 22, 2001, after
