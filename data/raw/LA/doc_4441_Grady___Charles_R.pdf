<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: CHARLES R. GRADY</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from formal 
 charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) against Charles R. 
 Grady, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana, but 
 currently suspended.<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<h3>Janie Smith Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In March 1998, Janie Smith, a Georgia resident, sold a piece 
 of property in Orleans Parish for $20,000. Respondent was the closing attorney 
 in the transaction and received $20,628.01 at the time of the sale for 
 disbursement. Respondent forwarded a check to Ms. Smith in the amount of 
 $18,933.01, which represented the proceeds from the sale, after deduction of 
 closing costs and taxes. Subsequently, respondent's check was returned for 
 insufficient funds.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Later analysis of respondent's bank records by an accountant 
 retained by the ODC indicated that the account on which the check was drawn was 
 not titled as a trust account, nor was it registered as an IOLTA account. It 
 was apparently used by respondent as a trust account, operating account and 
 personal account. The bank records indicated the account was overdrawn on 
 several occasions.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Thereafter, Ms. Smith retained William Skinner, a Georgia 
 attorney, to assist her in her collection efforts against respondent. After 
 several months, respondent paid Ms. Smith the full amount he owed her, 
 including her collection costs. Mr. Skinner then filed a complaint with the ODC 
 on Ms. Smith's behalf.</p>
<h3>Polly and Mary Smith Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In February 1997, Polly (also spelled Paulie) Smith, Jr. and 
 Mary Smith <a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> retained respondent for $3,500 to 
 pursue a malpractice claim against their accountant arising out of a city tax 
 dispute. At this time, respondent was ineligible to practice law because he 
 failed to comply with his mandatory continuing legal education requirements, 
 but failed to inform the Smiths of this fact.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Over the next several months, respondent took no action in 
 the case. On August 27, 1997, a petition for damages in the Smiths' case was 
 filed in First City Court for the City of New Orleans, bearing the signature of 
 attorney Vernon Thomas.<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> Mr. Smith later 
 testified that respondent never informed him that Vernon Thomas would be filing 
 the suit on his behalf, nor did he have any knowledge of Mr. Thomas or the 
 filing of the petition.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent did no further work on the Smiths' case. He did 
 not account for the fees he received, nor did he return any unearned fees.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed two counts of formal 
 charges against respondent. The first count, relating to the Janie Smith 
 matter, alleged respondent violated Rules <span class="Rules">

 <span class="Rules">5.5</span> </a>(unauthorized practice of law),
 <span class="Rules">8.1</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span>,
 <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span>, and
 <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an answer, asserting a blanket denial. A 
 formal hearing was scheduled before the committee. The ODC presented evidence 
 and testimony at the hearing; respondent failed to appear.</p>
<h3><a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=99-DB-049.HC$t=document-frameset.htm" target="main">Hearing Committee Report</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After consideration of the evidence, the hearing committee 
 found respondent violated the professional rules as charged. In the Janie Smith 
 matter (Count I), the hearing committee concluded respondent converted third 
 party funds by placing the proceeds from the sale in a personal account and 
 issuing Ms. Smith a worthless check As to Polly and Mary Smith 
 matter (Count II), the committee found respondent took money to represent the 
 Smiths while he was ineligible to practice law. It concluded respondent did not 
 pursue the matter and did not earn or return the fee.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, the hearing 
 committee recognized the presence of the following aggravating factors: prior 
 misconduct; failure to cooperate vulnerability of the victim; and incomplete or 
 late restitution. It identified no mitigating factors. Applying Standards 4.11 
 and 8.1(b) of the <i>ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, the 
 committee recommended respondent be disbarred. <a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a></p>
<h3><a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=99-DB-049.BD$t=document-frameset.htm" target="main">Disciplinary Board Report</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board agreed with the hearing committee's 
 finding that respondent knowingly and intentionally violated duties owed to his 
 clients, the public, the legal system and the profession, and caused 
 significant injury to his clients by failing to properly safeguard and 
 converting third party property; failing to complete work, failing to use 
 reasonable diligence, failing to provide competent representation and 
 communicate with his clients; deceiving his clients; failing to inform them he 
 was ineligible to practice; failing to charge a reasonable fee and failing to 
 return unearned fees.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The board adopted the aggravating factors cited by the 
 committee and agreed there is no evidence in support of any mitigating factors. 
 Citing prior jurisprudence from this court and the <i>ABA's Standards for 
 Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, the board agreed with the committee's 
 recommendation that respondent be disbarred from the practice of law. In 
 support, it observed respondent's prior discipline &quot;has not been effective in 
 deterring him from his pattern of misconduct&quot; and that respondent's &quot;disregard 
 for his professional obligations is made readily apparent by his failure to 
 participate in these proceedings and by his failure to fulfill his mandatory 
 continuing legal education responsibilities.&quot;</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this 
 court to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record supports the factual findings of the hearing 
 committee. Therefore, the sole issue before us is the appropriate penalty for 
 respondent's misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that 
 disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, 
 protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future 
 misconduct. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>,
 <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=513%20So.2d%201173$t=document-frameset.htm" target="main">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. 
 The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the 
 seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating 
 and mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n 
 v. Whittington</i>, <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=459%20So.2d%20520$t=document-frameset.htm" target="main">459 So. 2d 520</a> 
 (La. 1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's misconduct in the Janie Smith matter is serious 
 in nature. The bank account records demonstrate that respondent placed her 
 funds in an account which he treated as his personal account. The balance in 
 this account fell below the amount owed Ms. Smith on several occasions, proving 
 respondent converted her funds to his own use. Although respondent ultimately 
 made restitution to Ms. Smith, he deprived her of her funds for a period of 
 several months, and required her to obtain the services of another attorney to 
 recover the funds from respondent. These factors demonstrate respondent's 
 conversion is among the most serious type of conversion.&nbsp; See
 <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Hinrichs</i>,
 <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=486%20So.2d%20116$t=document-frameset.htm" target="main">486 So. 2d 116</a>, 122 (La. 1986)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's misconduct in the Polly and Mary Smith matter 
 is also serious.&nbsp; The record shows that respondent accepted the case and 
 received a fee from his client, even though he was ineligible to practice law 
 at the time. He attempted to conceal his ineligibility from his clients by 
 having another attorney file the petition in the case, with no notice of this 
 arrangement to his client. Otherwise, respondent totally neglected the case, 
 and has failed to account for or return the fee he received.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">We find no mitigating factors. However, the record reveals 
 the presence of several aggravating factors, including prior misconduct 
 (admonitions in 1990 and 1995, and a suspension in 1999), failure to cooperate, 
 and vulnerability of the victims.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Having considered the facts and seriousness of respondent's 
 offenses, and the aggravating factors, we find respondent lacks the fitness to 
 practice law in the State of Louisiana. Disbarment is the appropriate sanction.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the 
 disciplinary board, and considering the record filed herein, it is ordered that 
 the name of Charles R. Grady be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that 
 his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked. All costs and 
 expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with 
 Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days 
 from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
