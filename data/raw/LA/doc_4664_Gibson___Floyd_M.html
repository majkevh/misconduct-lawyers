<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-107.HC --#">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></h3>

<p class="bodycopy">After reviewing the record, the hearing committee determined the ODC proved by clear and convincing evidence a violation of each professional rule cited in the formal charges (though not in every instance where the rule was cited).&nbsp; The committee found sufficient evidence to 
support most of the allegations subject of each count, with the exception of Count XVII (the Rogers matter), where it found no evidence to support any of the rule violations alleged because Mr. Rogers did not testify.&nbsp; Specifically, the committee concluded respondent assumed the representation 
of numerous clients, was paid a fee, failed to communicate with his clients, failed to do the work for which he was paid, failed to account for earned fees and return unearned fees, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the complaints filed against him.&nbsp; The committee 
also pointed out that respondent improperly solicited the representation of one of his clients, and in connection with Count XVIII (the Howard matter), engaged in the practice of law after he was disbarred by this court.&nbsp; The committee concluded the baseline sanction for respondent's conduct is

<p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board generally concurred in the hearing committee's factual findings and its application of the Rules of Professional Conduct, though it rejected the committee's findings with respect to Count XVII, the Rogers matter.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" 
class="fn" id="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp; The board found respondent violated duties owed to his clients, the public, and as a professional.&nbsp; Respondent's conduct is both knowing and intentional in failing to provide legal services for which he had been paid.&nbsp; He failed to protect clients' 
property and account for and refund unearned fees.&nbsp; Respondent also continued to engage in the practice of law after being disbarred in November 2000.&nbsp; Clients have been harmed by respondent's failure to timely handle their legal matters, and multiple clients are owed refunds of legal 
fees.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">The board concurred in the aggravating factors cited by the hearing committee, and found the record also supports a finding that respondent is indifferent to making restitution.&nbsp; The board found no mitigating factors are present.&nbsp; Considering the weight of the 
aggravating factors present, and the absence of mitigating factors, the board recommended respondent be permanently disbarred.&nbsp; The board further recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from 
the date of finality of the court's judgment until paid.</p>

<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

<p class="bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court.&nbsp; La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(B).&nbsp; Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and 
convincing evidence.&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), <a href="#!-- #ID:646 So.2d 343 --#">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:597 So.2d 444 --#">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. While 
we are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings.&nbsp; <i>See <span class="CITE">In re: Caulfield</span></i><span class="CITE">, 96-1401 (La. 
11/25/96), <a href="#!-- #ID:683 So.2d 714 --#">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94), <a href="#!-- #ID:633 So.2d 150 --#">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Based on our review, we conclude the record supports the committee's findings that respondent engaged in multiple instances of serious misconduct.&nbsp; Specifically, he neglected his clients' legal matters, failed to communicate with his clients, failed to account for and refund 
unearned fees, failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation, engaged in the unauthorized practice of law after being disbarred by this court, and improperly solicited the representation of a client in a criminal matter.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Having found evidence of professional misconduct, the sole issue presented for our consideration is the appropriate sanction for respondent's actions.&nbsp; In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, 
protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct.&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:513 So.2d 1173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.&nbsp; The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each 
case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:459 So.2d 520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Respondent's misconduct represents a serious breach of his professional duties.&nbsp; Numerous aggravating factors are present, including respondent's prior disciplinary record, dishonest or selfish motive, pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the 
disciplinary proceeding, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, vulnerability of the victims, and substantial experience in the practice of law.&nbsp; We are unable to discern any mitigating factors from the record.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">The appropriate sanction for this misconduct is clearly disbarment.&nbsp; Thus, the sole remaining question is whether respondent's conduct is so egregious that he should be permanently prohibited from seeking readmission to the practice of law.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">In Appendix E to Supreme Court Rule XIX, we set forth guidelines illustrating the types of conduct which might warrant permanent disbarment.&nbsp; While these guidelines are not intended to bind this court in its decision-making process, they present useful information concerning 
the types of conduct we might consider worthy of permanent disbarment.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">For purposes of the instant case, Guidelines 8 and 9 are relevant.&nbsp; Those guidelines provide:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>GUIDELINE 8. Following notice, engaging in the unauthorized practice of law subsequent to resigning from the Bar Association, or during the period of time in which the lawyer is suspended from the practice of law or disbarred.</p>

<p>GUIDELINE 9. Instances of serious attorney misconduct or conviction of a serious crime, when the misconduct or conviction is preceded by suspension or disbarment for prior instances of serious attorney misconduct or conviction of a serious crime. Serious crime is defined in Rule XIX, Section 19. 
Serious attorney misconduct is defined for purposes of these&nbsp; guidelines as any misconduct which results in a suspension of more than one year.</p>

</blockquote>


<p class="bodycopy">Guideline 8 is clearly applicable to this case, as the undisputed evidence shows respondent continued to represent clients after his license to practice law was revoked by this court in <i>Gibson I</i>.&nbsp; Likewise, Guideline 9 is implicated, as the instant misconduct, which 
is unquestionably serious attorney misconduct, was preceded by respondent's disbarment for prior instances of serious attorney misconduct.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">We do not lightly impose the sanction of permanent disbarment.&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Morphis</i>, 01-2803 (La. 12/4/02), <a href="#!-- #ID:831 So.2d 934 --#">831 So. 2d 934</a></span>.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we are firmly convinced that we would be remiss in our 
constitutional duty to regulate the practice of law if we did not impose that sanction here.&nbsp; Respondent's actions convincingly demonstrate he does not possess the requisite moral fitness to practice law in this state.&nbsp; He must be permanently disbarred.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board's recommendation and impose permanent disbarment.</p>

<h2>&nbsp; DECREE</h2>

<p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that Floyd M. Gibson be permanently disbarred.&nbsp; Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 24(A), it is further ordered that respondent be 
permanently prohibited from being readmitted to the practice of law in this state.&nbsp; Respondent is ordered to furnish complete accountings and full restitution of all unearned legal fees to his clients subject of the formal charges.&nbsp; All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against 
respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref14" name="_ftn14" class="fn" id="_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp; The committee acknowledged that respondent made restitution to some of his victims, but because &quot;such restitution was not made until well after formal ethical complaints were filed and in many instances

<p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref15" name="_ftn15" class="fn" id="_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp; The committee had found the ODC did not meet its burden of proof because the complainant did not testify at the hearing. However, the board pointed out that</p>
