<p><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>Counts I and II</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In October of 1993, Paula Riles Guillory retained the respondent to represent her in a personal injury matter.&nbsp; In May of 1994, respondent advised Ms. Guillory that he negotiated a settlement on her behalf, but subsequently refused to communicate with her despite her repeated attempts.&nbsp; That same month, he received a draft from Allstate Insurance Company for $3,800, made payable to respondent and Ms. Guillory.&nbsp; He caused her name to be forged on the back of the check.&nbsp; Approximately fourteen months later, respondent provided </font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ms. Guillory a check for $1,950 from his personal checking account, representing her share of the settlement.&nbsp; He failed to provide an accounting or settlement documents.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ms. Guillory filed a complaint, and respondent failed to respond to the ODC's requests for information.&nbsp; The ODC issued a subpoena compelling his appearance for a scheduled deposition and requesting production of documents.&nbsp; While respondent appeared for his deposition, he failed to produce the requested documents.</font></p>
<p><b>Counts III and IV</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On February 23, 1994, Midland Risk Insurance Company issued a check in the amount of $5,612 made payable to respondent and his client, Brent Guillotte.&nbsp; Respondent forged his client's name to the check and deposited it into respondent's personal account with Iberia Savings Bank.&nbsp; On September 6, 1995, the bank from which the check was drawn sent the check back without payment to Iberia Savings Bank, stating Mr. Guillotte's name had been forged.&nbsp; It provided an affidavit from Mr. Guillotte attesting to such.&nbsp; Respondent failed to furnish Mr. Guillotte his portion of the settlement funds, nor did respondent have sufficient funds in his personal banking account to satisfy the amount of the settlement.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Attorneys for Iberia Savings Bank and Midland Risk Insurance Company filed complaints with the ODC advising of the forgery.</font><span class="CITE"><font size="1">1</font><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></span> Respondent failed to comply with the ODC's request for information.&nbsp; As a result, the ODC was forced to issue a subpoena compelling his cooperation.</p>
<p><b>Count V</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1992, Flossie Huderson Guilyot retained respondent to represent her in a personal injury matter.&nbsp; On March 3, 1992, respondent received a settlement check in the amount of $4,000 from National Car Rental, made payable to respondent and his client.&nbsp; Respondent cashed the check and failed to disburse any funds, either to Ms. Guilyot during her lifetime, or to her children after her death.</font><span class="CITE"><font size="1">2</font></span><font size="3">Charleslynn Guilyot, the client's daughter, filed a complaint with the ODC.</font></p>
<p><b>Counts VI and VII</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol B. Mallory retained respondent to represent her in connection with a personal injury case.&nbsp; In January of 1994, respondent received a check in the amount of $5,000, made payable to respondent and Ms. Mallory.&nbsp; After withholding funds to be paid to a third party medical provider, respondent issued a check to Ms. Mallory for her share of the settlement funds.&nbsp; The check was returned twice for insufficient funds.&nbsp; Respondent further failed to pay the medical providers, who provided services to his client and were guaranteed payment at the time of settlement.Ms. Mallory filed a complaint with the ODC.&nbsp; While the respondent provided an initial answer, he failed to respond to the ODC's request for supplemental information.&nbsp; The ODC issued a subpoena compelling his appearance for a scheduled deposition and production of documents.&nbsp; Respondent appeared for his deposition, but he failed to produce the requested documents.</font></p>
<p><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the complaints were filed, the ODC conducted an investigation.&nbsp; Subsequently, the ODC instituted formal charges against respondent.&nbsp; Respondent file an answer in which he denied the allegations of misconduct.&nbsp; A hearing was conducted before the hearing committee, at which time the ODC presented the testimony of the complainants.&nbsp; Respondent, who represented himself in proper person, did not present any witnesses or evidence.</font></p>
<p><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Ad003?an=JD_HC9725 --##'><b>Hearing Committee Recommendation</b></a><b></b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hearing committee found the ODC proved by clear and convincing evidence that respondent failed to communicate with clients, failed to remit settlement funds owed to his clients and third-party medical providers, failed to account for those funds, commingled and converted client funds, failed to pay third-party medical providers, forged his clients' names on settlement checks and failed to cooperate with the ODC.&nbsp; The hearing committee found respondent's actions were intentional and evidenced a total disregard for the welfare of his clients.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Relying on the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions,</font><span class="CITE"><font size="1">3</font><font size="3"> </font></span> as well as jurisprudence from this court,<font size="1">4</font><font size="3">&nbsp; the hearing committee determined the baseline sanction for respondent's conduct was disbarment.&nbsp; As the sole mitigating factor, it found respondent had a lack of a prior disciplinary record.&nbsp; By contrast, it recognized several aggravating factors: a pattern of misconduct, dishonest or selfish motive, multiple offenses, intentional bad faith obstruction of a disciplinary proceeding, vulnerability of the victims, substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted in 1984) and indifference to making restitution.&nbsp; Based on these factors, the committee </font></p>
<p><font size="3">recommended respondent be disbarred.</font></p>
<p><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A7dd1?an=JD_97-DB-025 --##'><b>Disciplinary Board Recommendation</b></a><b></b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The disciplinary board concurred in the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee.&nbsp; It also agreed that there was no justification to deviate downward from the baseline sanction of disbarment.&nbsp; In support, it stated:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondent repeatedly failed to cooperate with these proceedings which required additional expenditures of time and resources.&nbsp; Moreover, Respondent has never indicated any remorse for his selfishly motivated conduct and has made no efforts toward restitution.&nbsp; Most importantly, the Committee found that Respondent'<font face='Times New Roman'>s actions were intentional and that he repeatedly acted with a total disregard for the welfare of his clients.&nbsp; Respondent poses a substantial threat to the public and has already inflicted actual harm to vulnerable victims through his misconduct. </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">The board recommended disbarment, as well as payment of restitution.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the recommendation of the disciplinary board.</font></p>
<p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The record supports the finding that respondent violated the professional rules as charged.&nbsp; Respondent's actions, most notably his forgery of his clients' names on settlement checks and his commingling and conversion of client funds, convincingly demonstrates that respondent is not fit to practice law.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Accordingly, the only appropriate sanction in this case is </font>disbarment.</p>
<p><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that the name of Keith A. Lewis be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked.&nbsp; Respondent is ordered to </font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">make </font>full restitution to his victims. <font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> All costs and expenses in this matter are assessed against respondent in accordance </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s10'></a><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of this judgment until paid.</font></p>
