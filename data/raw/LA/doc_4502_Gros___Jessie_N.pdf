<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 98-B-0772</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: JESSIE N. GROS, III</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM<br>

</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary proceeding arises from the filing of six counts of formal 
charges by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) against respondent, Jessie 
N. Gros, III.</p>
<h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">At the outset, we note that 
respondent has been twice disbarred by this court for conduct unrelated to that 
at issue in the instant matter. In 1995, respondent was disbarred from the 
practice of law based on six counts of misconduct, which included misleading a 
client about the status of a matter, failing to respond to discovery resulting 
in the dismissal of a client’s suit, and commingling and converting client 
funds. <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Gros</i>, 95-0890 (La. 9/15/95),
<a href="#!-- #ID:660%20So.2d%20434 --#">660 So. 2d 434</a></span>. </p>
<p class="bodycopy">In 1997, the ODC filed additional 
charges against respondent for neglecting to file a suit, failing to communicate 
with a client, and commingling and converting client funds. We concluded this 
conduct warranted disbarment. As respondent was already disbarred, we extended 
the minimum period within which respondent could apply for readmission.
<span class="CITE"> <i>In 
re: Gros</i>, 97-1295 (La. 9/24/97), <a href="#!-- #ID:699%20So.2d%20384 --#">699 
So. 2d 384</a></span>. </p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<h3>Count 1</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">On September 11, 1996, respondent 
entered a guilty plea to two counts of theft over $100 in violation of
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.legis.state.la.us/tsrs/tsrs.asp?lawbody=RS&title=14&section=67">
La. R.S. 14:67</a>. He was sentenced to three years hard labor, suspended, and 
placed on active probation for three years.</p>
<h3>Counts II &amp; III</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">Randy P. Andras retained 
respondent to represent him in a community property division. In 1994, the trial 
court rendered a judgment in the case. In settlement of the community property, 
counsel for the opposing party forwarded respondent a check in the amount of 
$11,609.20, made payable to Mr. Andras. Respondent forged Mr. Andras’ 
endorsement on the check and converted the funds to his own use. Despite 
repeated attempts, Mr. Andras was unable to recover the funds, even after 
retaining counsel to assist him. Subsequently, respondent failed to cooperate in 
the ODC's investigation of the complaint filed by Mr. Andras. Respondent also 
refused to appear for a scheduled deposition pursuant to a subpoena.</p>
<h3>Count IV</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">In 1988, Raymond Lemoine retained 
respondent to represent him in a bankruptcy matter, as well as a domestic 
relations matter. Although respondent was paid $400, he failed to perform the 
services for which he was retained and failed to refund the unearned fee.</p>
<h3>Count V</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">On July 18, 1994, Kathleen 
Whittaker retained respondent to represent her in a garnishment case. He was 
paid a fee of $527, yet he performed virtually no work on the case. Respondent 
advised his client the garnishment matter had been resolved in court; however, 
court records indicated respondent failed to make any court appearances. The 
garnishment did not stop until Ms. Whittaker became employed by the respondent 
as a receptionist and was paid in cash.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">In October 1995, Ms. Whittaker 
paid respondent $182 to represent her in a child<br>
custody case. Respondent performed little or no work in the case.</p>
<h3>Count VI</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">On September 29, 1995, the order 
of this court disbarring respondent became final. <i>In re: Gros</i>, 95-0890 
(La. 9/15/95), <a href="#!-- #ID:660%20So.2d%20434 --#">660 So. 2d 434</a>. 
Respondent did not inform his clients of the disbarment and he engaged in the 
unauthorized practice of law.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed 
formal charges against respondent, alleging his conduct violated the following 
provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rule <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.3 --#">1.3</a></span> (failure to act with diligence in 
representing a client); Rule <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.4 --#">1.4</a></span> (failure to 
keep clients reasonably informed and comply with reasonable requests for 
information); Rule <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.15 --#">1.15</a></span> (failure to refund and 
account for unearned fees); Rule <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.16 --#">1.16</a></span>(d) 
(failure to protect client interests upon termination of representation); Rule
<span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.1 --#">8.1</a>(b)</span> (knowing failure to respond to a lawful 
demand for information in a disciplinary investigation); Rule
<span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.1 --#">8.1</a>(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in 
its investigation); Rule <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(a)</span> (violating the 
Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(b)</span> 
(criminal acts reflecting adversely on a lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or 
fitness as a lawyer); Rule <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, 
fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); Rule <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the 
administration of justice); and Rule <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(g) 
</span>(failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation).</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Respondent failed to file an 
answer to the formal charges. Accordingly, the matter was submitted to the 
hearing committee on documentary evidence only.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:96-DB-024.HC --#">Recommendation of the 
Hearing Committee</a></h3>
<p class="bodycopy">Because respondent failed to 
appear and answer the formal charges, the hearing committee concluded the 
charges were deemed admitted pursuant to <span class="AllRules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s11E --#">11</a>(E)(3)</span>. 
Therefore, the committee found the sole issue before it was the appropriate 
sanction for respondent’s misconduct.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">The committee concluded that even 
in the absence of respondent’s lengthy prior disciplinary history, the current 
charges would warrant disbarment. Accordingly, the committee recommended 
respondent be disbarred. </p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:96-DB-024.DB --#">Recommendation of the 
Disciplinary Board</a></h3>
<p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board agreed that 
respondent's actions were intentional and resulted in substantial harm to his 
clients, the profession, and the public. It also agreed that disbarment was the 
appropriate sanction. Recognizing that respondent had already been disbarred on 
two prior occasions, the board found as a practical matter he could not be 
disbarred again.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">However, citing <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State 
Bar Ass’n v. Krasnoff</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:502%20So.2d%201018 --#">502 So. 2d 
1018 </a>(La. 1987)</span>, the board recognized this court has the authority to extend 
the minimum period which must expire before respondent may apply for 
readmission. Finally, the board observed that it had recently recommended to 
this court that <span class="AllRules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s10A?an=2001-08-01 --#">10</a>(A)</span>, 
dealing with the types of sanctions which could be imposed in bar disciplinary 
cases, be amended to provide for permanent disbarment upon proof of compelling 
evidence. The board suggested that this case presented “compelling evidence” 
which would warrant consideration of permanent disbarment.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC 
objected to the disciplinary board’s recommendation, which was filed in this 
court on March 24, 1998. However, in light of the board’s recommendation that 
the court consider the imposition of permanent disbarment under the egregious 
facts of this case, we deferred action on the case pending our consideration of 
a rule relating to permanent disbarment.</p>
<p align="center"><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p class="bodycopy">On August 1, 2001, after a lengthy 
period of study and public comment, this court adopted amendments to Supreme 
Court Rule XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s10 --#">10</a>
<span class="fn">[<a href="#fn1">1</a>]</span> 
and §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s24 --#">24</a> <span class="fn">
[<a href="#fn2">2</a>]</span> to provide for the sanction 
of permanent disbarment. On September 13, 2001, we ordered respondent and the 
ODC to brief the issue of whether permanent disbarment should be imposed in this 
matter.<span class="fn">[<a href="#fn3">3</a>]</span> 
The order further provided that respondent could request oral argument in his 
brief, and that if such a request was made, the case would be docketed; 
otherwise, the matter would be considered only on the briefs. Respondent did not 
file a brief.<span class="fn">[<a href="#fn4">4</a>]</span></p>
<p class="bodycopy">However, on October 3, 2001, two 
attorneys potentially facing permanent disbarment filed a “Motion for Leave to 
File <i>Amicus Curiae</i> Brief, for Oral Argument, and to Participate in Oral 
Argument.” The amici asserted that they are in a similar posture to respondent 
as their misconduct occurred prior to August 1, 2001, but the ODC will be 
seeking to permanently disbar them.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Because of the unusual issues 
presented in this case, we permitted the amici to file briefs and participate in 
oral argument. At oral argument, the amici suggested that the permanent 
disbarment rules could not operate retroactively because to do so would deprive 
the respondent-attorney of the right to seek readmission, a right granted to him 
at the time of the underlying misconduct. In opposition, the ODC argued that 
this court always had discretion to foreclose a disbarred attorney from seeking 
readmission, and contended the rule changes were merely guidelines by which the 
court will exercise its discretion and authority.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Having considered the record of 
the instant proceeding in light of the well-presented arguments of the <i>amici</i> and 
the ODC, we now conclude that we need not resolve the issue of retroactivity of 
the permanent disbarment rules in the context of the present facts.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">While the disciplinary board’s 
recommendation that we consider the imposition of permanent disbarment in this 
matter and our resulting decision to defer consideration of the matter were well 
intentioned, our lengthy deliberations over the permanent disbarment rule 
resulted in this case being held nearly three years. The resulting delay itself 
presents a factor which must be considered. See Standard 9.32(i) of the ABA’s 
Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Hand</i>, 00-3106 (La. 6/1/01),
<a href="#!-- #ID:787%20So.2d%20294 --#">787 So. 2d 294</a></span>.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Most significantly, our review of 
the record in this case reveals the misconduct in the instant case occurred 
within the same time frame as the misconduct which resulted in respondent’s 
previous disbarments. In <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:573%20So.2d%20470 --#">573 So. 2d 470</a> (La. 1991)</span>, we 
observed that when the underlying conduct occurs within the same period as the 
misconduct forming the basis for a previous disbarment, the discipline imposed 
should be determined as if both proceedings were before the court 
simultaneously. Applying this procedure in <i>Chatelain</i>, we declined to 
extend the minimum period for readmission. Instead, we adjudged the respondent 
guilty of additional violations which were added to his record for consideration 
in the event he applied for readmission after becoming eligible to do so.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">In determining an appropriate 
sanction in the instant case, we believe the approach of <i>Chatelain</i> is 
instructive. Accordingly, our determination of a sanction will be based upon the 
appropriate sanction we would have imposed if these charges had been before the 
court at the same time as the charges in respondent’s previous disciplinary 
proceedings.<span class="fn">[<a href="#fn5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p class="bodycopy">Disbarment is clearly the 
appropriate penalty for the violations in this case. Respondent’s commingling 
and conversion of client funds and neglect of client matters, combined with his 
criminal conviction for theft, convincingly demonstrates that he has engaged in 
some of the most serious professional misconduct an attorney can commit. No 
mitigating factors are present.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Had the instant charges been filed 
simultaneously with those charges forming the basis of respondent’s earlier 
disbarments, they would have only reinforced our view that respondent lacks the 
moral fitness to practice law and must be disbarred, both as a sanction for his 
misconduct and to protect the public. Therefore, as in <i>Chatelain</i>, we will 
adjudge respondent guilty of additional violations which warrant disbarment and 
which will be added to his record for consideration in the event he applies for 
readmission after becoming eligible to do so. We further emphasize that although 
respondent may have a procedural right to apply for readmission, this court 
retains absolute discretion to grant or deny such an application. In light of 
respondent’s lengthy history of egregious misconduct, this court will carefully 
scrutinize any application for readmission with a critical eye.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">In sum, without passing on the 
question of whether we could apply the permanent disbarment rules to this case, 
we elect in our discretion to resolve this case under the principles set forth 
in <i>Chatelain</i>. Accordingly, respondent is adjudged guilty of additional 
violations which warrant disbarment and which will be added to his record for 
consideration in the event he applies for readmission after becoming eligible to 
do so.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">For the reasons assigned, 
respondent, Jessie N. Gros, III, is adjudged guilty of additional violations 
which warrant disbarment and which will be added to his record for consideration 
in the event he applies for readmission after becoming eligible to do so. All 
costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance 
with Supreme Court Rule XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s10.1 --#">10.1</a>, with legal 
interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s 
judgment until paid.</p>
<hr>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> Supreme Court Rule XIX, §10(A) was amended to add the 
highlighted language: </p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify" class="footnotetext">(1) Disbarment by the court. <b>In any order or judgment of 
 the court in which a lawyer is disbarred, the court retains the discretion to 
 permanently disbar the lawyer and permanently prohibit any such lawyer from 
 being readmitted to the practice of law.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> Supreme Court Rule XIX, §24(A) was amended to add the 
highlighted language:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify" class="footnotetext">A disbarred lawyer or a suspended lawyer who has served a 
 suspension period of more than one year, exclusive of any waivers or periods of 
 deferral, shall be reinstated or readmitted only upon order of the court. No 
 lawyer may petition for reinstatement until six months before the period of 
 suspension has expired. No lawyer may petition for readmission until five years 
 after the effective date of disbarment. A lawyer who has been placed on interim 
 suspension and is then disbarred for the same misconduct that was the ground 
 for the interim suspension may petition for readmission at the expiration of 
 five years from the time of the effective date of the interim suspension. <b>
 The court retains the discretion, in accordance with Section 10A of this rule, 
 to permanently disbar a lawyer and permanently prohibit any such lawyer from 
 being readmitted to the practice of law.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> Similar orders were issued in 
<span class="CITE">In re: Parker, 00-B-3532</span>, 
and <span class="CITE">In re: Patrick, 01-B-1419</span>. We address those cases in separate opinions 
rendered this day.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> However, on October 3, 2001, this court received a letter 
from attorney Bill Porteous, which states in pertinent part as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify" class="footnotetext">Mr. Jessie N. Gros, III has asked that I address you in his 
 behalf informally with regard to the Order of September 13, 2001 directing that 
 he file a brief addressing whether the sanction of permanent disbarment should 
 be imposed in his case. This letter is written on behalf of Mr. Gros who 
 acknowledges his wrongdoing about which he is regretful and remorseful. He 
 advises me that he has made good on all of the financial obligations which gave 
 rise to his troubles. However, he feels that he cannot proceed further in this 
 matter because of the emotional upheaval the reopening of this matter has 
 occasioned for him and his family. He has asked that I write to you in this 
 regard and ask that the Court recognize that he and his family are humanly so 
 destroyed by what has happened to him that he wishes to proceed no further.</p>
 <p align="justify" class="footnotetext">He has asked me to write this letter to you and is fully 
 aware of its contents. Mr. Gros regrets what has happened to him but did not 
 wish that the Court might think that its Order was being ignored. He simply can 
 go no further. The humiliation, embarrassment and reopening of old wounds which 
 this matter occasions is too difficult for him and his family.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">5 </a>Our decision should not be interpreted as espousing the 
position advanced by the amici in this case that the date of the misconduct 
determines whether the permanent disbarment rules should be applied. As noted 
above, we expressly decline to resolve that issue, and nothing in this opinion 
should be interpreted as passing on whether we could or could not impose 
permanent disbarment under these facts.</p>
