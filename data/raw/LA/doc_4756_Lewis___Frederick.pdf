  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 03-B-3314</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: FREDERICK LEWIS, JR.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from six counts of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Frederick Lewis, Jr., an attorney licensed to practice law in
  Louisiana. </p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On May 5, 1999, the ODC filed four counts of formal charges against respondent arising from
  complaints filed by Diana Geil and Deborah and Russell Jackson.  On April 9, 2001, the ODC amended the charges to
  include two additional counts of misconduct arising from complaints filed by Enola Bradford and Angela Taylor.  The
  underlying facts are as follows:</p>

  <h3>Counts I and II - The Geil Matter</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In September 1996, Diana Geil retained respondent to pursue a collection matter on her behalf. 
  Ms. Geil allegedly informed respondent that time was of the essence and asked that suit be filed against the debtor
  as soon as possible because he was a flight risk.  In October 1996, Ms. Geil paid respondent $275 to cover the costs
  of filing suit, but respondent failed to adhere to his client's request to file suit immediately.  In addition,
  respondent failed to respond to Ms. Geil's efforts to retrieve her original documents.<a name="_ftnref1" title=""
  href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>Ms. Geil ultimately retained other counsel who filed suit on her behalf
  in February 1997.  However, during the period that respondent was handling the file, the debtor allegedly moved from
  the Shreveport area, making it difficult to effect service of the lawsuit. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In February 1997, Ms. Geil filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC.  The ODC forwarded
  a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail.  Respondent failed to reply to the complaint.  The ODC
  thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on June 20, 1997 and answer the complaint under
  oath.  Respondent filed a response to the complaint on June 19, 1997 but failed to appear for the scheduled
  deposition. </p>

  <h3>Counts III and IV - The Jackson Matter</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In August 1994, Deborah and Russell Jackson retained respondent to represent them in a personal
  injury matter.  In April 1996, respondent succeeded in obtaining a judgment on behalf of his clients and subsequently
  disbursed the monies to his clients.  Respondent failed, however, to deposit client and third-party funds in a
  properly labeled trust account.  He commingled and converted third-party funds, and failed to inform third parties
  that he had received their funds.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In May 1997, the Jacksons filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC.  The ODC forwarded a
  copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail.  Respondent failed to reply to the complaint.  The ODC
  thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on July 16, 1997 and answer the complaint under
  oath.  The ODC granted respondent's request that the deposition be rescheduled for July 28, 1997.  Respondent failed
  to appear on that date but he finally submitted to a deposition on October 24, 1997, during which he agreed to
  provide his trust account records to the ODC.  Respondent failed to produce his records and the ODC issued additional
  requests in November 1997 and January 1998.  Shortly thereafter, the ODC issued a subpoena for respondent to appear
  at another deposition but the Caddo Parish sheriff was unable to serve respondent.  Finally, respondent was
  personally served in March 1999 to appear before the ODC.  At respondent's request, the ODC agreed to postpone the
  deposition until April.  Subsequently, respondent failed to appear and failed to produce his trust account
  records.</p>

  <h3>Count V - The Bradford Matter</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Enola Bradford retained respondent to represent her in a personal injury matter.  Respondent
  settled Ms. Bradford's case and deposited the settlement funds into his operating account, rather than a properly
  labeled trust account.  Respondent then forwarded Ms. Bradford a check for $1,033, representing her portion of the
  settlement.  This check was returned for insufficient funds.</p>

  <h3>Count VI - The Taylor Matter</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In February 1999, Angela Taylor paid respondent $1,115 to represent her in a divorce and custody
  matter.  Respondent thereafter filed the petition for divorce and obtained an order awarding his client temporary
  sole custody of the children, child support and an income assignment.  In August 1999, respondent was certified
  ineligible to practice law for failure to comply with his professional obligations.<a name="_ftnref2" title=""
  href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>Respondent did not communicate to his client that he could no longer
  represent her and he apparently abandoned her case.  Ms. Taylor was required to retain another attorney to respond to
  a rule for child custody that her husband filed. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Ms. Taylor filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC.  Respondent failed to cooperate
  with the ODC in its investigation of the complaint.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">In its formal charges, the ODC alleged that respondent's conduct violated the following
  provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with
  reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to
  communicate with a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.5(f)</span> (payment of fees in advance of services),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.15</span> (safekeeping property of clients or third persons),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> (termination of the representation),
  <span class="allegedrules">3.4(c)</span> (knowing disobedience of an obligation under the rules of a tribunal),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.1(b)</span> (knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand for information from a
  disciplinary authority), <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(b)</span> (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on the lawyer's honesty,
  trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving
  dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct
  prejudicial to the administration of justice), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate
  with the ODC in its investigation).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent answered the original formal charges and denied any misconduct.  Respondent did not
  file an answer to the amended formal charges.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../hc/2003-01-13_01-db-097.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">This matter proceeded to a formal hearing on the merits.  Considering the evidence presented, the
  hearing committee found:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1.As to Counts I and II, respondent failed to promptly file the petition as requested by Ms.
    Geil and failed to communicate with her despite her numerous attempts to reach him, including visits to his
    office.  However, there is no clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated Rule 8.4(g) (failure to
    cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) when he failed to appear for a June 20, 1997 deposition scheduled in
    the Geil matter.  The record reflects that respondent wrote a letter, which the ODC received on June 19, 1997,
    requesting that the deposition be rescheduled due to his inability to obtain transportation to Baton Rouge.</p>

    <p class="inverted">2.As to Counts III and IV, there is clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated Rule
    <span class="Rules">1.15</span> when he failed to properly handle and safeguard funds he owed to third-party
    medical providers out of the Jackson personal injury matter.  Although respondent withheld the funds, he failed to
    deposit the funds in a properly labeled trust account and failed to pay the medical providers.  There is also clear
    and convincing evidence that respondent violated Rules <span class="Rules">8.1</span> and
    <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> in failing to cooperate with the ODC's investigative efforts.  Respondent failed
    to appear at scheduled depositions and failed to provide documents and records that the ODC requested.</p>

    <p class="inverted">3.With respect to Count V, there is clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated Rule
    1.15 when he failed to deposit the settlement check from the Bradford matter into a proper trust account and when
    he wrote his client a settlement check for which there were insufficient funds.  As of the date of the committee's
    report, respondent had yet to pay Ms. Bradford her share of the settlement, $1,033. </p>

    <p class="inverted">4.Regarding Count VI, the evidence indicates clearly and convincingly that respondent violated
    Rule <span class="Rules">1.4</span> by failing to communicate with his client.  Respondent also clearly violated
    Rule <span class="Rules">1.16</span> when he failed to withdraw from representing Ms. Taylor after he became
    ineligible to practice law and failed to surrender the client's file to her.  Further, respondent violated Rules
    8.1 and 8.4 when he failed to cooperate with the ODC's investigation.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">Considering the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>,<a name="_ftnref3" title=""
  href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>the committee concluded that the baseline sanction for respondent's
  misconduct is a suspension from the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The committee found the following aggravating factors in this case:
  <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary offenses</span>,<a name="_ftnref4" title="" href="#_ftn4"
  id="_ftnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith obstruction of the
  disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with orders of the disciplinary agency</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span> (admitted 1985), and
  <span class="ABAstandard">indifference to making restitution</span>.  The committee considered the following factors
  in mitigation: <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest or selfish motive</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">personal or emotional problems</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>, and
  <span class="ABAstandard">remoteness of the prior offenses</span>.  The committee also commented that based on its
  review of respondent's testimony and other evidence, they are of the belief that while respondent committed the
  violations knowingly, he did not commit them intentionally.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Under these circumstances, the committee recommended that respondent be suspended from the
  practice of law for a period of two years and be required to make full restitution to his clients and third-party
  medical providers.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2003-12-04_01-DB-097.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board found the hearing committee's findings of fact are supported by the
  evidence.  With regard to the charge of failure to cooperate in Count VI, the board supplemented the findings as
  follows:</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">By letter dated November 3, 1999, the ODC initially requested that respondent file a response to
  Ms. Taylor's complaint.  The ODC sent another request to respondent on November 18, 1999.  Because of respondent's
  inaction, the ODC issued a subpoena requesting his appearance on February 8, 2000.  On February 3, 2000, respondent
  informed the ODC that he was unable to appear on February 8, 2000.  Then, on February 7, 2000, respondent sent the
  ODC a copy of his response to the complaint, which he allegedly drafted on December 3, 1999.  Respondent's failure to
  promptly respond and cooperate caused at least a three-month delay in the investigation. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on the factual findings of the committee, as supplemented above, the board determined
  respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="bodycopy">Counts I and II - The board found respondent failed to act diligently and failed to communicate
    with his client in the Geil collection matter, in violation of Rules 1.3 and 1.4.  The board also agreed with the
    committee's finding that the ODC failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated Rules
    3.4(c)and 8.4(a)(g).</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">Counts III and IV - The board found respondent failed to pay third-party medical providers
    despite withholding the funds to do so, in violation of Rule 1.15(b).  In addition, the board found that respondent
    violated Rules 8.4(a) and (b) because by converting funds due to third parties, he committed a criminal act that
    reflects adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer.  Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c) when
    he represented to the Jacksons that he intended to pay their medical expenses from the settlement, but failed to do
    so.  The board agreed with the committee's finding that respondent's failure to appear at depositions and failure
    to provide documents violated the Rules of Professional Conduct.  Also, when respondent ignored the subpoenas
    issued by the ODC, he "knowingly disobeyed the rules of the tribunal" and violated Rule 3.4(c).  By violating the
    foregoing rules, respondent violated Rule 8.4(a).  The board declined to find a violation of Rule 8.4(d).</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">Count V - The board agreed that respondent violated Rule 1.15(a) when he deposited Ms.
    Bradford's settlement check into his operating account instead of his trust account, thereby causing the check he
    issued to Ms. Bradford to be returned for insufficient funds.  As of December 4, 2003, respondent still had not
    paid restitution to Ms. Bradford.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">Count VI - The board agreed that respondent violated Rule 1.4 when he failed to inform Ms.
    Taylor that he was ineligible to practice law.  Further, he violated Rule 1.16(d) when he failed to withdraw as
    counsel for Ms. Taylor after being certified ineligible to practice law.Ms. Taylor was unaware of respondent's
    ineligible status and continued her attempts to contact him to handle her pending child custody case.  Thereafter,
    respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC's investigation, in violation of Rules 8.1(c) and 8.4(g).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">The board concluded that respondent knowingly and intentionally violated duties owed to his
  clients and to the profession.  The board further determined that respondent's conduct caused significant actual harm
  to his clients and third-party medical providers.  In addition, his failure to communicate with clients caused delays
  in their legal matters.  Finally, respondent's failure to cooperate with the ODC placed additional burden and expense
  on the disciplinary system.  The baseline sanction for respondent's conduct ranges from a lengthy suspension to
  disbarment. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The board concurred in the aggravating and mitigating factors cited by the hearing committee,
  with the exception of the mitigating factor of remoteness of prior disciplinary offenses.  The board noted that
  respondent's last admonition was imposed in 1995, and thus concluded that his prior offenses cannot be considered
  "remote."</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Considering the prior jurisprudence involving misconduct similar to respondent's, the board found
  a three-year suspension is appropriate. <i>See <span class="cite">In re: Sabludowsky</span></i><span class="cite">,
  00-0891 (La. 6/16/00), <a href="2000-06-16_2000-0891.htm">761 So. 2d 1283</a></span> (attorney given a three-year
  suspension for failure to pay a third-party medical provider from client settlement funds and failure to maintain an
  adequate balance in his trust account); <span class="cite"><i>In re: Graham</i>, 02-2789 (La. 1/31/03),
  <a href="2003-01-31_2002-2789.htm">841 So. 2d 707</a></span> (after considering the <i>Hinrichs</i> test, the court
  imposed a three-year suspension on an attorney who failed to remit funds to medical providers, converted the funds,
  and then failed to cooperate with the ODC);<span class="cite"><i>In re: Feazel</i>, 01-2309 (La. 11/9/01),
  <a href="2001-11-09_2001-2309.htm">800 So. 2d 771</a></span> (attorney who had a pattern of neglecting clients' legal
  matters and failing to cooperate with the ODC received three-year suspension, with one year deferred, subject to
  supervised probation); and <span class="cite"><i>In re: Boudreau</i>, 2000-3158 (La. 1/5/01),
  <a href="2001-01-05_2000-3158.htm">776 So. 2d 428</a></span> (in consent discipline matter, attorney received a
  three-year suspension for failure to account for or return unearned fees, failure to communicate, neglect of client
  matters and failure to cooperate with ODC).  In view of the mitigating circumstances present in this case, and
  considering that respondent has declined to accept new clients since these proceedings began in 1999, the board
  determined it is appropriate to defer one year of the three-year suspension. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on this reasoning, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of
  law for three years, with one year deferred.  The board further recommended that respondent be ordered to make
  restitution to his clients and third- party medical providers and that he attend the Louisiana State Bar
  Association's Ethics School.Finally, the board recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of
  these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court.  La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence.  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Quaid</i>,
  94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana
  State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall</i>, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>.  While we
  are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have
  held the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings.  <i>See <span class="cite">In re:
  Caulfield</span></i><span class="cite">, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d
  714</a></span>; <span class="cite"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94),
  <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The record supports the detailed factual findings of the hearing committee.  Respondent has
  neglected his clients' legal matters, failed to communicate with his clients, commingled and converted client and
  third-party funds, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Having found evidence of professional misconduct, we now turn to a determination of the
  appropriate sanction for respondent's actions.  In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary
  proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the
  profession, and deter future misconduct.  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>,
  <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.  The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances.  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent's conduct harmed his clients by delaying resolution of their legal matters and
  depriving them of their funds.  Under similar facts, this court has imposed lengthy suspensions.  <i>See, e.g.,
  <span class="cite">In re: Powers</span></i><span class="cite">, 99-2069 (La. 9/24/99),
  <a href="1999-09-24_1999-2069.htm">744 So. 2d 1275</a></span> (three-year suspension imposed on attorney with a prior
  disciplinary record for similar misconduct who neglected three clients' legal matters, failed to communicate with the
  clients, failed to account for and return unearned fees, and failed to cooperate with the ODC).  Aggravating factors
  are present, such as a pattern of misconduct, respondent's substantial experience in the practice of law, and his
  prior disciplinary record.  However, we also recognize the presence of mitigating factors, including respondent's
  personal and emotional problems at the time of the misconduct and his remorse for his actions. Accordingly, we will
  adopt the disciplinary board's recommendation and suspend respondent from the practice of law for three years, with
  one year deferred.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Frederick Lewis, Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 17025, be suspended
  from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of three years.  It is further ordered that one year of this
  suspension shall be deferred.  Respondent is ordered to make restitution of all monies owed to clients and third
  parties and to attend the Louisiana State Bar Association's Ethics School.  All costs and expenses in the matter are
  assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty
  days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
