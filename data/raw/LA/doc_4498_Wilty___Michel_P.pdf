<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 01-B-2983</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: MICHEL P. WILTY</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">This disciplinary proceeding arises from a petition for consent
discipline filed by Michel P. Wilty, an attorney licensed to
practice law in the State of Louisiana, but currently on interim
suspension.&nbsp; The Office of Disciplinary Counsel
(&ldquo;ODC&rdquo;)&nbsp; concurred in the petition, and the
disciplinary board recommended it be accepted.&nbsp; For the
reasons assigned, we now accept the petition for consent discipline
and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state.</p>



<p><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">This proceeding involves four separate instances of misconduct.
The facts are not in dispute, having been stipulated to by the
parties.</p>



<p><i>Faulk Matter</i></p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Jessica Lee Faulk retained respondent in April 1999 to represent
her in connection with a claim for damages and injuries arising out
of a defective mobile home.&nbsp; Ms. Faulk subsequently filed a
complaint with the ODC, alleging that after being retained,
respondent failed to communicate with her or take any action in the
case.&nbsp; The ODC sent respondent a copy of the complaint by
certified mail in June 2000.&nbsp; He failed to respond to this
request and other requests for information from the ODC, requiring
the ODC to issue a subpoena for his appearance.</p>



<p><i>Slay Matter</i></p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Respondent represented Bill Slay in a personal injury
matter.&nbsp; Shortly after Mr. Slay received a settlement in the
case, respondent came to his home and asked Mr. Slay to loan him
$2,000.&nbsp; The loan was made without the issuance of a
promissory note, interest rate, or security.&nbsp; Respondent later
acknowledged that the terms of the loan were &ldquo;unreasonable,
unfair, and not in the best interest of the client.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Additionally, respondent admitted he did not advise Mr. Slay to
seek review of the arrangement by outside counsel, nor did he
obtain a written waiver of conflict from Mr. Slay.</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">After Mr. Slay filed his complaint, the ODC sent notice of the
complaint to respondent.&nbsp; Respondent failed to reply,
requiring the ODC to serve him with a subpoena.</p>



<p><i>Scarlett Matter</i> </p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">In July 1999, William Bradley Scarlett hired respondent to
represent him in connection with an offshore personal injury
matter.&nbsp; After September 1999, respondent failed to
communicate with Mr. Scarlett, and made no effort to move the case
along in any meaningful manner.&nbsp; As a result, Mr. Scarlett
filed a complaint with the ODC.</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">The ODC sent a copy of the complaint to respondent.&nbsp; He
refused to respond, requiring the ODC to issue a subpoena
compelling him to appear for a deposition.&nbsp; Respondent
ultimately appeared and provided sworn testimony.&nbsp; Respondent
admitted that he had taken little or no action in the prosecution
of Mr. Scarlett&rsquo;s case.&nbsp; Upon review of
respondent&rsquo;s case file in the Scarlett matter, the ODC found
notice of intent by the federal court to dismiss the matter on the
basis of neglect and delay.&nbsp; There was also correspondence in
the file indicating that opposing counsel had made repeated efforts
to contact respondent, but was unable to do so.</p>



<p><i>Unauthorized Practice of Law</i></p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">In the course of investigating the Faulk, Slay, and Scarlett
matters, the ODC learned that respondent had been engaging in the
practice of law while he was ineligible to do so.&nbsp; The ODC
determined respondent was declared ineligible to practice effective
August 1, 1999 for failure to comply with his mandatory continuing
legal education requirements.&nbsp; He was also declared ineligible
on September 3, 1999 for failure to pay his bar dues and
disciplinary assessment.&nbsp; In his sworn statement, respondent
acknowledged that he engaged in the practice of law throughout the
period of his ineligibility.&nbsp; The ODC also determined
respondent failed to keep his registration address current on the
bar rolls, as required by the rules of this court.</p>



<p align="center"><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>

<p align="center"><i>Formal Charges/Petition for Consent Discipline</i></p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">After investigation, the ODC filed four counts of formal charges
against respondent.&nbsp; The charges alleged respondent violated
the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rule
<a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.3'>1.3</a>
(failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in the
representation of a client); Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.4'>1.4</a>(a)
(failure to keep a client reasonably informed of a matter and
promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.8'>1.8</a>(a)
(knowingly entering into a business transaction with a client on
terms which are inherently unfair and unreasonable); Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE5.5'>5.5</a>(a)
(engaging in the unauthorized practice of law); Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.1'>8.1</a>(c)
(failing to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation); Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'>8.4</a>(a)
(violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'>8.4</a>(g)
(failing to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation).&nbsp; The
charges also alleged respondent violated Supreme Court Rule XIX,
&sect;<a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s8'>8</a>(c) by
failing to keep his registration address current.</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Respondent filed an answer to the formal charges, in which he
generally denied the allegations, and the matter was set for formal
hearing.&nbsp; Prior to the hearing, however, respondent and the
ODC filed a joint motion for interim suspension in this
court.&nbsp; This court granted the motion and placed respondent on
interim suspension effective May 9, 2001.&nbsp; <i>In re:
Wilty</i>, 01-1306 (La. 5/9/01), <a href="#!-- #ID:789%20So.2d%20564 --#">789 So. 2d 564</a>.</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Approximately one month later, respondent filed a petition for
consent discipline, in which he acknowledged the allegations of the
formal charges and requested that he be disbarred.&nbsp; The ODC
concurred in the petition for consent discipline. Pursuant to
Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect;<a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s20'>20</a>, the
hearing on the formal charges was canceled and the petition was
submitted to the disciplinary board for its consideration.</p>



<p><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-003.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Citing <i>In re: Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96),
<a href="#!-- #ID:675%20So.2d%20272 --#">675 So. 2d
272</a>, the disciplinary board recognized that in light of
respondent&rsquo;s admissions, it must accept that he violated the
rules as charged.&nbsp; Therefore, it found the sole issue before
it was whether the proposed sanction was appropriate.</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">In determining the appropriateness of the sanction, the board
looked to the four factors set forth in Supreme Court Rule XIX,
&sect;<a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s10'>10</a>(C).<a id="_ednref1" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""></a>&nbsp; The
board found respondent knowingly and intentionally violated duties
to his clients, the public, the legal system, and the legal
profession.&nbsp; It concluded that respondent&rsquo;s neglect of
the legal matters of Ms. Faulk and Mr. Scarlett created the
potential for serious injury to these clients.&nbsp; Likewise, it
observed respondent&rsquo;s decision to enter into a prohibited
loan transaction with Mr. Slay exposed that client to potential
injury.&nbsp; Finally, the board found the legal profession as a
whole was harmed by respondent&rsquo;s unauthorized practice of law
during the period of his ineligibility.</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">The board noted that the petition for consent discipline did not
identify any aggravating or mitigating factors.&nbsp; Based on the
record, the board found two aggravating factors: pattern of
misconduct and multiple offenses.&nbsp; It found no mitigating
factors.</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">The board concluded that the proposed sanction of disbarment was
consistent with Standard 7.1 of the ABA&rsquo;s <i>Standards for
Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>,<a id="_ednref2" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""></a> and was supported by jurisprudence
from this court.<a id="_ednref3" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""></a>&nbsp; Therefore, the board recommended the petition
for consent discipline be accepted and that respondent be
disbarred.</p>



<p align="center"><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Although this matter arises from a petition for consent
discipline, Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s20'>20</a>(B)
provides that the extent of discipline to be imposed is subject to
review.&nbsp; In determining an appropriate sanction, we are
mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high
standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of
the profession, and deter future misconduct.&nbsp; <i>Louisiana
State Bar Ass&rsquo;n v. Reis</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La.
1987).&nbsp; The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of
each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered
in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.&nbsp;
<i>Louisiana State Bar Ass&rsquo;n v. Whittington</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520  --#">459 So. 2d
520</a> (La. 1984).</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">The misconduct in this case, as admitted by respondent, involves
neglect of client matters, failure to communicate with clients,
entering into a prohibited business transaction with a client, the
unauthorized practice of law, and failure to cooperate with the
ODC.&nbsp; The record does not disclose whether any clients
suffered actual injury as a result of respondent&rsquo;s
misconduct, but there was clear potential for injury due to his
actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">The disciplinary board identified two aggravating factors from
the record, a pattern of misconduct and multiple offenses.&nbsp; In
addition to those aggravating factors, we also recognize
respondent&rsquo;s substantial experience in the practice of law,
as he was admitted to the bar in 1985.&nbsp; We are unable to
discern any mitigating factors from the record.</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that the
proposed sanction of disbarment, while on the higher end of the
range of discipline imposed under similar facts, is not
inappropriate in this case.<a id="_ednref4" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""></a>&nbsp; Accordingly, we will accept the
petition for consent discipline and disbar respondent.</p>



<p align="center"><b>DECREE</b></p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the
disciplinary board, and considering the record filed herein, it is
ordered that the petition for consent discipline be accepted.&nbsp;
Accordingly, it is ordered that the name of Michel P. Wilty be
stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to
practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked. All costs and
expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in
accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s10.1'>10.1</a>,
with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
finality of this court&rsquo;s judgment until paid.</p>

<div id="edn1">
<p><a id="_edn1" href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title=""></a>&nbsp;
Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect;<a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s10'>10</a>(C)
sets forth the following factors for consideration in imposing
sanctions:</p>

<p>(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to
the public, to the legal system, or to the profession;</p>

<p>(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or
negligently;</p>

<p>(3) the amount of the actual or potential injury caused by the
lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

<p>(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn2">
<p><a id="_edn2" href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title=""></a>&nbsp;
Standard 7.1 provides that disbarment is generally appropriate
&ldquo;when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a
violation of a duty owed to the profession with the intent to
obtain a benefit for the lawyer or another, and causes serious or
potentially serious injury to a client, the public, or the legal
system.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="edn3">
<p><a id="_edn3" href="#_ednref3" name="_edn3" title=""></a>&nbsp;
In support, the board cited <i>In re: Wyche</i>, 00-0029 (La.
3/31/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:756%20So.2d%20311 --#">756 So. 2d 311</a> (three-year suspension imposed on attorney
who practiced law while he was ineligible, neglected a legal
matter, failed to communicate with his client, and failed to
cooperate with the ODC); and <i>In re: Richard</i>, 00-1418 (La.
9/1/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:767%20So.2d%2036  --#">767 So. 2d 36 </a>(attorney disbarred for engaging in the
unauthorized practice of law while ineligible).</p>
</div>

<div id="edn4">
<p><a id="_edn4" href="#_ednref4" name="_edn4" title=""></a>&nbsp;
Because the sanction in consent discipline proceedings is arrived
at by mutual agreement between respondent and the ODC, and is not
necessarily the sanction this court would impose under the facts,
it has limited precedential value in future cases.&nbsp; <i>In re:
Boudreau</i>, 00&#8209;3158 (La. 1/5/01), <a href="#!-- #ID:776%20So.2d%20428 --#">776 So. 2d 428</a>.&nbsp;
While this court has rejected sanctions in consent discipline
proceedings which are too lenient, we have sometimes accepted
sanctions which arguably could be considered too harsh, based on
the fact that the parties have agreed to the sanction. See <i>In
re: Hernandez</i>, 00&#8209;1283 (La. 10/6/00),
<a href="#!-- #ID:770%20So.2d%20330 --#">770 So. 2d 330</a>;
<i>In re: Estess</i>, 98&#8209;2741 (La. 1/8/99),
