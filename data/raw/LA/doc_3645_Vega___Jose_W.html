  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <h3>PER CURIAM</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a joint petition for consent discipline,
  prior to the institution of formal charges, by Jose W. Vega ("Respondent") of Houston, Texas, an attorney licensed to
  practice law in the State of Louisiana, and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC"). For reasons stated below, the
  Disciplinary Board accepts the petition and orders a public reprimand be issued against Respondent.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On February 14, 2001, ODC and Respondent filed a joint petition for consent discipline and
  stipulation of facts in this matter.  On March 26, 2001, Respondent filed an initial brief in support of the proposed
  sanction. No formal charges have been filed in this matter.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On April 26, 2001, a panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter. Deputy Disciplinary
  Counsel G. Fred Ours represented ODC. Respondent appeared, <i>pro se</i>.</p>

  <h2><b>STIPULATED FACTS</b></h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The stipulation of facts filed in this matter provides as follows:</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Miras Dusevic retained Mr. Vega on September 30, 1996 to represent him in his deportation
  proceedings at the Immigration Court in Oakdale, Louisiana.  Mr. Vega made several court appearances on behalf of Mr.
  Dusevic in connection with an application for relief from deportation.  Mr. Vega also represented Mr. Dusevic in a
  bond hearing, and Mr. Dusevic was able to post bond and was released from custody from the Immigration and
  Naturalization Service ("INS").  On May 14, 1997, the INS placed additional charges of deportability on Mr. Dusevic
  as a result in the change of law.  The new charges rendered Mr. Dusevic ineligible from relief from deportation, and
  he was ordered deported by the Immigration Judge.  After Mr. Dusevic was ordered deported, Mr. Vega charged him
  $1,500.00 to file an appeal.  Mr. Dusevic sent Mr. Vega the $1,500.00 after the appeal was due.  Mr. Vega agreed to
  file a late appeal for Mr. Dusevic; however, he did not file a late appeal because the deportation officer for the
  INS was requiring that Mr. Dusevic surrender himself into custody if he wanted to file a late appeal.  Mr. Dusevic
  agreed to self-deportation so he would not have to return to the custody of the INS.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Mr. Vega committed an ethical violation by stating to Mr. Dusevic that he would file a late
  appeal for him, accepting a $1,500.00 fee to do so, and not filing the late appeal on Mr. Dusevic's behalf and
  immediately returning the $1,500.00. His conduct violated Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3 and 1.16(d).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Mr. Vega thought that it was in his client's best interest not to file a late appeal because the
  INS stated to him that Mr. Dusevic would have to surrender himself into custody if he wanted to continue fighting the
  case.  Mr. Vega was able to negotiate an indefinite surrender date and a self-deportation for his client.  However,
  Mr. Vega obviously did not clearly explain to Mr. Dusevic the conditions of those terms.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Mr. Vega has now returned the $1,500.00 that he was paid for the late appeal.  Mr. Dusevic took
  all of the original documents from his file and he did not return these documents to Mr. Vega.  Mr. Dusevic has been
  voluntarily deported.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Mr. Vega has taken remedial steps to assure that this situation does not arise again.  He now
  prepares a detailed client retainer agreement before he begins working on a case.  He keeps a detailed time chart for
  each file.  He records a summary of every conversation that he has with a client.  He clearly explains to each client
  the options that exist prior to being retained, and he does not make important case strategy decisions without the
  clear consent of the client.  Please note that he has gradually implemented these procedures and has not received any
  complaints at all in almost two years, even though his practice has increased throughout this period of time.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The errors that Mr. Vega committed in this matter occurred within eighteen months of beginning
  his solo practice.  He has not repeated those errors, and has taken steps within his practice to assure that these
  errors are never repeated.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy"><b>II.</b></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Pedro Estevez retained Mr. Vega in December of 1995 to represent him in his deportation
  proceedings in Oakdale, Louisiana, for a fee of $1,500.00. Mr. Estevez, through his attorney Mr. Vega, applied for
  relief from deportation, which was denied by the Immigration Judge, and Mr. Vega filed a timely appeal of the Judge's
  decision.  While on appeal, there was a change in the law which allowed Mr. Estevez to reopen his proceeding with the
  Immigration Judge.  Mr. Vega was paid $1,000.00 to reopen the proceedings for Mr. Estevez, and to obtain a bond for
  him.  Mr. Vega submitted a motion to reopen to the Board of Immigration Appeals in May of 1997, and the Board of
  Immigration Appeals reopened the case on May 19, 1997.  On June 18, 1997, the Immigration Judge ordered Mr. Estevez
  removed from the United States for a second time.  Mr. Vega reserved Mr. Estevez's right to appeal by July 18, 1997. 
  On June 30, 1997, Mr. Vega represented Mr. Estevez in a bond hearing, and the Immigration Judge set a bond in the
  case.  Mr. Vega did not file a motion to withdraw as the attorney of record after Mr. Estevez bonded out.  After the
  time had expired to file an appeal, Mr. Vega realized that he was still attorney of record, and he attempted to file
  a late appeal. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Estevez's new attorney enrolled as the attorney of record.  Mr. Estevez was
  subsequently deported.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Mr. Vega admits that he did not properly and timely withdraw as the attorney of record in this
  matter.  Upon realizing that no appeal had been filed, Mr. Vega attempted to file a late appeal because he was still
  the attorney of record.  Mr. Vega was the attorney of record, and he should have either withdrawn as the attorney of
  record or filed a timely appeal.  His conduct violated Rules of Professional Conduct
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> and <span class="allegedrules">1. 16</span>. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">He has implemented measures in his office practice to insure that this situation does not occur
  again.  He has implemented a tickler system, and also records in the file all of the conversations that he has with
  his clients.  Mr. Vega has not had any similar problems for more than two years.  This incident occurred one year
  after he became a solo practitioner (July 1997), and he has taken the necessary means to assure that it does not
  happen again.</p>

  <h2>PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">In the petition, Respondent admits to violating Rule <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (lack of
  diligence) and Rule <span class="Rules">1.16</span> (improper termination of representation) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct. The parties propose that a formal public reprimand be issued to Respondent.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rules 1.3 and 1.16 of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.  The Board must accept that Respondent has violated these rules.  <span class="cite"><i>In re
  Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96); <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given the
  violations of these rules, the Board is left to determine if the proposed sanction is appropriate.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1. whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system,
    or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">2. whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">3. the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">4. the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based upon a review of the record, the Board finds that Respondent has negligently violated
  duties owed to his clients. The parties contend that Respondent's misconduct in this matter caused very little actual
  injury to Respondent's clients. The record supports this contention. While Respondent failed to timely file appeals
  on behalf of his clients, ultimately both clients were deported: one voluntarily and one by legal proceeding.
  Additionally, Respondent's failure to timely return the fee received from Mr. Dusevic did deprive his client of those
  funds for a limited time. However, the fee has now been returned to Mr. Dusevic.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The mitigating factors of <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary
  record</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest or selfish motive</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">lack of experience</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">cooperative attitude toward these
  proceedings</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span> are present here. The sole aggravating factor
  present in this matter is <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Finally, the proposed sanction is in keeping with the ABA Standards<a href="#_edn1"
  name="_ednref1" class="fn" id="_ednref1">[i]</a> and prior jurisprudence.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn"
  id="_ednref2">[ii]</a></p>

  <h2>RECOMMENDATION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the petition for consent discipline be accepted, and
  that a public reprimand be issued against the respondent, Jose W. Vega. The Board also orders the Respondent be
  assessed all costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the
  date of this order until paid.</p>
