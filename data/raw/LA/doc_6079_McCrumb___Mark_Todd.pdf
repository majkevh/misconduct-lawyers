<p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="headingstyle">NO. 07-B-1112</p>
<p class="headingstyle">IN RE: MARK TODD MCCRUMB</p>
<p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 21(A), the Office of 
Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) filed this reciprocal discipline proceeding against 
respondent, Mark Todd McCrumb, an attorney licensed to practice law in the 
States of Louisiana and Washington, based upon discipline imposed by the Supreme 
Court of Washington.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">The underlying facts of this matter are set forth in detail 
in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Washington, which is reported as In re: 
Mark Todd McCrumb, Attorney at Law, Washington Supreme Court Docket No. 
200,451-2 (January 30, 2007). Based on the evidence developed in that 
proceeding, the Supreme Court of Washington concluded that respondent presented 
an order changing a court's oral ruling, made false representations during the 
disciplinary process, and commingled and converted client funds in various acts 
of mismanagement of his trust account, all in violation of numerous provisions 
of the Washington Rules of Professional Conduct. As a sanction, the Supreme 
Court of Washington disbarred respondent effective February 6, 2007.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After receiving Notice of Disbarment from the Supreme Court 
of Washington, the ODC filed a motion to initiate reciprocal discipline in 
Louisiana, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 21. Attached to the motion was 
a certified copy of the order of the Supreme Court of Washington. On May 31, 
2007, this court rendered an order giving respondent and the ODC thirty days to 
raise any claim, predicated upon the grounds set forth in Supreme Court Rule 
XIX, § 21(D), that the imposition of identical discipline in Louisiana would be 
unwarranted and the reasons for that claim. Respondent failed to file any 
response in this court.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">The standard for imposition of discipline on a reciprocal 
basis is set forth in Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 21(D), which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Discipline to be Imposed. Upon the expiration of thirty days from service 
	of the notice pursuant to the provisions of paragraph B, this court shall 
	impose the identical discipline or disability inactive status unless 
	disciplinary counsel or the lawyer demonstrates, or this court finds that it 
	clearly appears upon the face of the record from which the discipline is 
	predicated, that:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>(1) The procedure was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard 
		as to constitute a deprivation of due process; or</p>
		<p>(2) Based on the record created by the jurisdiction that imposed the 
		discipline, there was such infirmity of proof establishing the 
		misconduct as to give rise to the clear conviction that the court could 
		not, consistent with its duty, accept as final the conclusion on that 
		subject; or</p>
		<p>(3) The imposition of the same discipline by the court would result 
		in grave injustice or be offensive to the public policy of the 
		jurisdiction; or</p>
		<p>(4) The misconduct established warrants substantially different 
		discipline in this state; or</p>
		<p>(5) The reason for the original transfer to disability inactive 
		status no longer exists.</p>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class="Bodycopy">In the instant case, respondent has made no showing of any 
infirmities in the Washington proceeding, nor do we discern any from our review 
of the record. Likewise, we see no reason to deviate from the sanction imposed 
by the Supreme Court of Washington. To the contrary, the sanction imposed by the 
Supreme Court of Washington is consistent with the jurisprudence of this court, 
which indicates respondent's misconduct warrants severe discipline.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will disbar respondent as reciprocal 
discipline pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 21.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering the motion for reciprocal discipline filed by 
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and the record filed herein, it is ordered 
that Mark Todd McCrumb, Louisiana Bar Roll number 21764, be and he hereby is 
disbarred. His name shall be stricken from the roll of attorneys and his license 
to practice law in the State of Louisiana shall be revoked.</p>
<hr>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1">1</a> Arguably, 
Louisiana jurisprudence supports the imposition of permanent disbarment for 
similar misconduct. See, e.g., In re: Spradling, 06-1971 (La. 1/26/07), 952 So. 
2d 642 (attorney permanently disbarred for serious professional misconduct, 
including the conversion of client funds and making misrepresentations of 
material fact during his disciplinary proceeding). However, Washington has not 
adopted permanent disbarment, but instead permits disbarred attorneys to seek 
reinstatement after six years. See Rule 25.1 of the Washington Admission to 
Practice Rules. For purposes of consistency with our sister state, we will 
therefore impose ordinary disbarment. See, e.g., In re Zdravkovich, 831 A.2d 
964, 968-69 (D.C. 2003) (&quot;There is merit in according deference, for its own 
sake, to the actions of other jurisdictions with respect to the attorneys over 
whom we share supervisory authority&quot;).</p>
