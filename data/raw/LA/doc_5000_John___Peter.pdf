  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 06-B-0173</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: PETER JOHN</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that
  respondent gave legal advice to his client's co-defendant in a pending criminal case, without his client's knowledge
  or consent and without prior notice to or the consent of the co-defendant's counsel of record. Prior to the filing of
  formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent discipline in which respondent admitted
  that he failed to communicate with his client and failed to avoid a conflict of interest, in violation of Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.4</span> and <span class="Rules">1.7</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Having
  reviewed the petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Peter John, Louisiana
  Bar Roll number 25725, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months. This suspension shall be
  deferred in its entirety, subject to respondent's successful completion of a one-year period of probation governed by
  the terms and conditions set forth in the Petition for Consent Discipline. Any failure of respondent to comply with
  the conditions of probation, or any misconduct during the probationary period, may be grounds for making the deferred
  suspension executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
