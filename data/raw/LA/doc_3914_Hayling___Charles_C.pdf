<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Louisiana State Bar Association, through its Committee on Professional Responsibility, instituted a proceeding against Charles C. Hayling III, a member of said association.&nbsp; Prior to the commencement of this proceeding, the committee had conducted investigations of respondent's alleged misconduct in accordance with article 15, section 3 of the articles of incorporation of the association.&nbsp; Notice of the proceedings which involved six specifications of misconduct, was sent to respondent by certified and regular mail dated February 20, 1987.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The committee held a formal investigative hearing on the six specifications on March 14, 1987, as provided in article 15, section 3(b) of the articles of incorporation.&nbsp; Respondent was not present nor was he represented by counsel at this hearing. </font></span><span class="footnotereference"><font size="1" color="#008000">1</font></span><font size="3" color="#000000"> Based on the </font><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">evidence adduced at the hearing, the committee was of the unanimous opinion that respondent had violated laws of the state relating to the professional conduct of lawyers and the practice of law of sufficient gravity as to evidence a lack of moral fitness for the practice of law.&nbsp; Specifically, the committee found that respondent was guilty of the misconduct described in the specifications.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On April 21, 1987, the committee instituted in this court a suit for disciplinary action against respondent under the provisions of article 15, section 4(c) of the articles of incorporation.&nbsp; Respondent filed an answer to the petition.&nbsp; The court, by order, then appointed Mr. Cyrus J. Greco as commissioner to take evidence and file a report with this court setting forth his findings of fact and conclusions of law.&nbsp; Louisiana State Bar Association Articles of Incorporation, article 15, section 6(b) and (d).</font></span></p>

<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first specification of misconduct concerns respondent's handling of settlement funds belonging to one of his clients, Ms. Pearley Mealey.&nbsp; The specification accuses respondent of neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him in violation of </font> (A) (3),<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> of failing to maintain complete records of client's funds and of failing to render appropriate accounts to his client regarding those funds in violation of </font> (B) (3),<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> and of commingling and converting his client's funds in violation</font></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">The witnesses testifying at the investigative hearing regarding this specification were Ms. Mealey, Mr. Ralph Brewer and Ms. Barbara Ann Bergeron, an employee of State Farm Insurance Company claims department.&nbsp; According to testimony of the these witnesses, Ms. Mealey hired respondent to represent her in a personal injury claim that arose out of an automobile accident.&nbsp; Respondent agreed to represent her.&nbsp; He went to the office of the adjuster, Ms. Bergeron, and settled Ms. Mealey's case for $5,000.&nbsp; Respondent received a draft dated July 12, 1985 for the amount payable to himself and Ms. Mealey.&nbsp; Ms. Mealey was supposed to get $3,000 out of that $5,000, leaving a fee of $2,000 for respondent.&nbsp; Respondent had Ms. Mealey endorse the draft.&nbsp; According to a copy of the back of ;he draft, it was negotiated (cashed) at Ancona's Stop &amp; Save.&nbsp; One of the endorsements stamped on the back of the draft is dated July 22, 1985, so the draft was cashed by respondent in July of 1985.&nbsp; Ms. Mealev tried to contact respondent to </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><u>get</u></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> her money on more than one occasion but had Trouble reaching him.&nbsp; When she finally did reach him, respondent told her to come to his office at a certain date and time.&nbsp; When Ms. Mealey came to respondent's office at that time, respondent was not there and left a message that he had sprained or broken his ankle.&nbsp; Ms. Mealey then wrote to the Committee on Professional Responsibility and retained an attorneys Mr. Brewer, who agreed to work pro bono for Ms. Mealey to recover the money from respondent.&nbsp; After numerous contacts between Mr. Brewer and respondent, respondent finally paid Ms. Mealey $3,015.34 on November 19, 1985, some four months after respondent had cashed the draft.</font></span><span class="footnotereference"><font face='Times New Roman' size="1" color="#008000"> 8</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"> The commissioner found that the committee had proven its allegations in Specification No. 1.

<p><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">proved and respondent admitted in his answer that he did not deposit Ms. Mealey's funds in a separate account.&nbsp; Thus, the burden was on respondent to show that there was no commingling or conversion of the funds.&nbsp; Respondent offered no evidence and only claimed in his answer that his wife took the funds.&nbsp; This unsubstantiated claim is not enough for respondent to show that there was no commingling or conversion of Ms. Mealey's funds.&nbsp; Therefore, we agree with the commissioner that respondent commingled and converted his client's funds in violation of </font></span> (A) and (B). <font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> We also agree with the commissioner that respondent failed to maintain complete records of his client's funds and failed to render appropriate accounts to his client regarding them in violation of </font> (B) (3)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3">.&nbsp; We agree that respondent violated </font> (A) (3)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> since he neglected to timely disburse the funds that were entrusted to him by Ms. Mealey.&nbsp; We also agree that respondent violated </font>.</p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The second specification of misconduct concerns respondent's alleged failure to pay a chiropractor's fee after guaranteeing the fee and withholding an amount to cover the fee from settlement funds.&nbsp; This specification alleges that respondent neglected a legal matter entrusted to him in violation of </font> and  (A) (3) <font face='Times New Roman' size="3">and that respondent failed to maintain complete records of client's funds and failed to render appropriate accounts to his client regarding the funds in violation of </font> (B)</p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The specification further alleges that respondent commingled and converted the funds in violation of </font> and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=DR9-102'></a> (A) and (B).&nbsp; <font face='Times New Roman' size="3">The only witnesses to testify at the investigative hearing about this specification were Mr. Donnie Rogers and Dr. Thomas C. Plantz.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Donnie Rogers testified that he hired respondent to represent him in an insurance claim.&nbsp; He stated that his case was settled for about $5,000 and that he received $2,500 from the settlement.&nbsp; He said that he authorized respondent to withhold funds to pay a proctologist, two back specialists and two other doctors.&nbsp; He stated that $500 was withheld to pay Dr. Plantz, the chiropractor.&nbsp; Mr. Rogers testified that about one year after the settlement, he found out from Dr. Plantz that the bill had not been paid and he told Dr. Plantz that respondent was supposed to pay the bill.&nbsp; Mr. Rogers then attempted to contact respondent and when he finally was able to do so, respondent stated that he was going to take care of the bill.&nbsp; Mr. Rogers further testified that respondent gave him a sheet of paper that showed the settlement amount and the various amounts withheld to pay the doctors including the $500 due Dr. Plantz.&nbsp; Dr. Plantz testified that Mr. Roger's case was settled in September of 1985 and that respondent had guaranteed to pay his fee.&nbsp; He stated that his fee was $550.&nbsp; Dr. Plantz testified that the last time he talked to respondent, respondent said that he was going to forward the </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="2">money.&nbsp; Dr. Plantz stated that the money was never forwarded. </font><span class="footnotereference"><font face='Times New Roman' size="1" color="#008000">14</font></span></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The commissioner found that the committee had proven its case on Specification No. 2. We agree with the commissioner's finding that respondent violated </font> (A) (3).<font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; The paying of Dr. Plantz' bill was a legal matter that respondent neglected.&nbsp; However, we disagree that there was sufficient evidence to show commingling and conversion.&nbsp; Unlike the evidence in Specifications Nos. 1 and 3, there is no evidence here as to what happened to the money that respondent withheld from the settlement.&nbsp; There is no testimony or copy of a settlement draft that shows that respondent failed to deposit that draft in a separate account.&nbsp; The evidence only shows that respondent withheld </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><u>money to</u></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> paid.&nbsp; That evidence by itself is </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><u>insufficient under our holding-in </u></font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">Louisiana State</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> </font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">Bar Association v.

<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The third specification of misconduct concerns respondent's handling of Erma Wheeler's settlement funds.&nbsp; This specification accuses respondent of neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him in violation of </font> and  (A) (3),<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> of failing to maintain complete records of his client's funds and of failing to render appropriate accounts to his client regarding the funds in violation of </font> (B) (3) <font face='Times New Roman' size="3">and of commingling and converting the funds in violation of </font> (A) and (B).<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> The only witnesses to testify about this specification were James M. Field and Erma Wheeler.&nbsp; Their testimony indicates that Erma Wheeler hired respondent to handle a personal injury claim against Winn Dixie.&nbsp; Respondent settled the case and obtained a draft from Winn Dixie for $5,000 that was dated March 29, 1986 and was payable to both Erma Wheeler and respondent.&nbsp; The draft was then endorsed and cashed at Ancona's Stop &amp; Save.&nbsp; The endorsements on the back of the copy of this draft were dated March 26, 1986.&nbsp; Ms. Wheeler testified that she believed her share of the settlement was all but seven percent.&nbsp; At the time of the settlement, Ms. Wheeler was told by respondent that she would get her money in three or four days.&nbsp; After a few days went by with Ms. Wheeler hearing nothing from respondent, she tried to contact him </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><u>by</u></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> going over to his. office several times but was never able to g</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><u>et</u></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> in contact with respondent.&nbsp; She then retained an attorney, James M. Field, to help get her money.&nbsp; She also complained to the Bar Association.&nbsp; When respondent found out that he had been reported to the Bar Association, he contacted Ms. Wheeler and offered her $3,000 if she would drop her complaint.&nbsp; Ms. Wheeler refused and at the time of the investigative hearing she had still not received her money.&nbsp; However, during oral argument before this court, the committee stated that it had received a letter from Mr. Field that stated that Ms. Wheeler had received the money from respondent.</font><span class="footnotereference"><font face='Times New Roman' size="1" color="#008000"> 19</font></span></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The commissioner found that the committee had proven the allegations in Specification No. 3. We agree that respondent is guilty of commingling and conversion in violation of </font> (A) and (B)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3">.&nbsp; The committee proved that respondent did not deposit Ms. Wheeler's funds in a separate account and respondent submitted no evidence other than an unsubstantiated claim as to what happened to those funds.&nbsp; Respondent also violated </font> (B) (3) <font face='Times New Roman' size="3">since he failed to maintain records or render appropriate accounts to Ms. Wheeler concerning those funds.&nbsp; We also agree that respondent neglected a legal matter entrusted to him in violation of </font> (A) (3)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3">.&nbsp; Respondent also violated </font>.</p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Specification No. 4 alleges that respondent was hired by Mr. John Taylor and was paid $150 to handle a collection matter and then respondent neglected to take any action in violation of</font></span>  (A) (3)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3">. The specification-also alleges that respondent failed to carry out a contract of employment and prejudiced his client's interest in violation of </font> (A) (2) and (3). </p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><u>only</u></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> witness to testify about this specification was Mr. John Taylor.&nbsp; He testified that he hired respondent to collect three bad checks in the amounts of $3,700, $800 and $500.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor testified that he paid $150 to respondent for this work.&nbsp; When Mr. Taylor contacted respondent about a year later, respondent told him that he should file the papers that respondent had prepared.&nbsp; Respondent also lost the $800 and $500 checks that had been given to him.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor testified that respondent's failure to work on his case contributed to his business'</font></p>

<p><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">The commissioner found that the allegations in this specification were proven by the committee.&nbsp; We agree that respondent, by never filing Mr. Taylor's suit, neglected a legal matter entrusted to him in violation of</font></span>  (A) (3)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> and that he failed to carry out a contract of employment in violation of </font> (A) (2). <font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> We also agree that by losing two of the three checks, respondent prejudiced Mr. Taylor during the course of his professional relationship with him in violation of </font> (A) (3).</p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is alleged in Specification No. 5 that respondent, after being hired to complete an adoption case, neglected to perform any work on that case in violation of </font> (A) (3) and  (A) (2) and (3). </p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The only witness to testify about this specification was Ida Mae Williams Young.&nbsp; She testified that she hired respondent in late 1985 to handle an adoption for her.&nbsp; She stated that she paid him $260 but the receipt that respondent gave her indicates that she gave him only $210.&nbsp; When the work was completed, she was going to pay respondent an additional $200.&nbsp; Ms. Young testified that </font>respondent did write up some papers that she and the natural mother later came to respondent's office to sign.&nbsp; Respondent told her at that time that it would be from six months to a year before the adoption would be completed.&nbsp; She stated that she then tried to contact respondent by phone and letter but that she was never able to get in touch with him after that time.&nbsp; The adoption papers still have<font size="2"> </font>not been filed<font size="2">. 25</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The commissioner found that the committee had proven the allegations in Specification No. 5. We agree that respondent violated </font> (A) (3)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> since he was retained to handle an adoption that he failed to complete.&nbsp; It was no excuse for respondent not to complete his work for the reason that he had not yet received the balance of his fee.&nbsp; He was only due the balance upon completion of the work.&nbsp; However, we do not agree that respondent violated </font> (A) (2) and (3)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3">.&nbsp; That disciplinary rule has nothing to do with respondent's actions under this specification.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The final specification of misconduct, No. 6, alleges that respondent failed to cooperate with the committee in its investigation of misconduct in violation of </font> (A) (1), (4), (5) and (6) and Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a> <span class="footnotereference"><font face='Times New Roman' size="1" color="#008000">27</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp; Since 1985, the committee has called and sent letters and subpoenas to respondent.&nbsp; Other than the filing </font><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman' size="2">of his answer, respondent has never made any official responses to the committee, the commissioner or this court.</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; Respondent has also failed to show up at either the com</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="2">mittee or the commissioner's hearing.&nbsp; We </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="2"><b>agree </b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="2">with the</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> commissioner that respondent's continuous failure to cooperate with the committee violates </font></span> (A) (1), (5) and (6) and Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a> (a), (d) and (g)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> of the new Rules of Professional Conduct.&nbsp; However, we do not agree that respondent violated </font> (A) (4) and other subsections of Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a>.</p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The purpose of lawyer disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer but rather to maintain appropriate standards of professional conduct to safeguard the public, to preserve the integrity of the legal profession and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility.&nbsp; The discipline to be imposed will depend upon the seriousness of the offense involved and the facts and circumstances of each case.&nbsp; The court will take into account both aggravating and mitigating circumstances. </font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2"> Louisiana State Bar Association</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><u> v. </u></font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">520 (La Hickman, 471 So. 2d 696 (La. 1985); Louisiana State Bar Association v. Whittington, 459 So. 2d. 1984).</font></span></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After several years of practice, respondent, with no prior disciplinary offenses, started a pattern of misconduct beginning in 1985.&nbsp; In two cases, respondent received settlement drafts in the amount of $5,000 and neglected to timely disburse to his clients their share of the drafts.&nbsp; In one case, respondent disbursed the proceeds about four months after he received the draft and in the other case almost two years after he received the draft.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">For this conduct, respondent is guilty of commingling and conversion, neglecting legal matters entrusted to him, and failing to maintain complete records of his clients' funds and failing to render appropriate accounts to his clients regarding those funds.&nbsp; In another case, respondent withheld money from a settlement to pay a chiropractor's fee that he had guaranteed but never paid.&nbsp; For this conduct, respondent is guilty of neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him.&nbsp; However, unlike the commissioner, we did not find respondent guilty of commingling and conversion and failing to maintain complete records of his client's funds and failing to render appropriate accounts to his client.&nbsp; In two other cases, respondent received money from his clients to handle a collection matter and an adoption, ($150 for the collection matter and $210 for the adoption), but he never completed those cases even though he did perform some of the paper work for them.&nbsp; For this conduct, respondent is guilty of neglecting legal matters entrusted to him.&nbsp; In the collection matter, respondent is also guilty of failing to carry out a contract of employment.&nbsp; Respondent prejudiced his client's interest by losing two of the checks in the collection matter.&nbsp; Finally, respondent failed to cooperate fully with the committee, the commissioner or this court in these proceedings.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Having found respondent guilty of misconduct, we consider that disciplinary action is warranted.&nbsp; However, we do not find respondent's conduct, though serious, warrants disbarment.&nbsp; The facts of this case involve most of the factors contained in the three year suspension category listed in </font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">Louisiana State Bar Association v. Hinrichs, 486 So. 2d 116 (La. 1986).</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; There is no evidence of bad faith, forgery or other fraudulent acts in connection with the conversions.&nbsp; Moreover, there is no evidence of how respondent benefited from his infractions.&nbsp; His clients were injured </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><u>by</u></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> his conduct.&nbsp; However, in the conversion cases, respondent did </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><u>pay</u></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> his clients the money owed to them, though only after they had retained an attorney and complaints had been lodged with the committee.&nbsp; Respondent has been guilty of no prior disciplinary offenses.&nbsp; Thus, other than non-cooperation with the committee, respondent's conduct fits under the guidelines listed in Hinrichs for three year suspension from the practice of law.&nbsp; It is true that since respondent has been found guilty of not cooperating with the committee, his conduct is more serious than those we have suspended for three years.&nbsp; However, unlike the committee and the commissioner, we do not feel that that difference requires respondent to be disbarred.&nbsp; We feel that respondent's non-cooperation with the committee warrants an extra six months of suspension.&nbsp; Therefore, we find that respondent should be suspended from the practice of law for three years and six months from the date of this decree.&nbsp; However, reinstatement will not be automatic.&nbsp; Respondent may apply for reinstatement after three years and six months upon a showing to the committee that he has refunded the $150 to Mr. Taylor, the $210 to Ms. Young, and after he has paid Dr.'Plantz the $550 owed to him.</font></p>
<p><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the reasons assigned, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that Charles C.
