  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 03-B-3198</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: ROBERT W. STRATTON</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from one count of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Robert W. Stratton, an attorney licensed to practice law in
  Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Beginning in January 1990, attorneys Dennis Weber and Philip Dugas leased office space from
  respondent, who practiced law in a building he owned in Baton Rouge.  Each attorney agreed to pay one-third of the
  office expenses, including the cost of a secretary.  In February 1990, Ann Purvis, who had worked for respondent
  previously, was employed to do secretarial work for all three attorneys.  In September 1991, Mr. Weber and Mr. Dugas
  relocated their law offices and terminated their lease and expense-sharing arrangement with respondent.  On September
  30, 1991, Mrs. Purvis resigned her position with respondent and went to work for Mr. Weber and Mr. Dugas. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On July 20, 1992, respondent filed suit against Mrs. Purvis, claiming that she intentionally
  interfered with his contractual relationship with Mr. Weber and Mr. Dugas.  <i>Robert W. Stratton, APLC v. Ann C.
  Purvis</i>, No. 385,406 on the docket of the 19th Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton
  Rouge.<a name="_ftnref1" class="fn" href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">1</a> Respondent alleged that Mrs. Purvis' conduct
  was the cause of the dissolution of his lease and expense-sharing arrangement with Mr. Weber and Mr. Dugas.  On July
  2, 1993, the trial court granted a motion for summary judgment filed by Mrs. Purvis and dismissed respondent's suit. 
  The trial court's judgment was affirmed on appeal, and writs were denied by this court.  <i>Robert W. Stratton, APLC
  v. Ann C. Purvis</i>, 94-0022 (La. App. 1st Cir. 6/23/95), 658 So. 2d 843 (not designated for publication), <i>writ
  denied</i>, 95-1875 (La. 11/3/95), 661 So. 2d 1385.<a name="_ftnref2" class="fn" href="#_ftn2"
  id="_ftnref2">2</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On December 13, 1995, after the judgment in respondent's suit against her became final, Mrs.
  Purvis filed suit against respondent for malicious prosecution.  She later amended her petition to allege the
  intentional infliction of emotional distress.  <i>Ann C. Purvis v. Robert W. Stratton, APLC and Robert W.
  Stratton</i>, No. 423,166 on the docket of the 19th Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge. 
  After protracted pre-trial maneuvering, the case was finally tried over three days in February 1999.  The jury
  returned a verdict in Mrs. Purvis' favor, awarding $100,000 in general damages and $25,000 in attorney's fees on the
  malicious prosecution claim, and $90,000 for respondent's intentional infliction of emotional distress, for a total
  of $215,000.  The jury award was affirmed on appeal, and writs were denied by this court.  <i>Ann C. Purvis v. Robert
  W. Stratton, APLC and Robert W. Stratton</i>, 99-1594 (La. App. 1st Cir. 6/23/00) (not designated for publication),
  <i>writ denied</i>, 00-2659 (La. 11/17/00), 774 So. 2d 980.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In February 2001, respondent filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection.  Mrs. Purvis' claim
  against respondent in the bankruptcy proceeding totaled more than $419,000.  As of mid-2002, respondent had paid
  approximately $159,000 of this amount, leaving some $260,000 still due to Mrs. Purvis.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On March 26, 2001, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent, alleging that
  his conduct violated the following provisions of the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">3.1</span> (meritorious claims and contentions), <span class="allegedrules">4.4</span>
  (respect for rights of third persons), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the
  administration of justice).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent answered the formal charges and generally admitted the factual allegations set forth
  therein.  The matter then proceeded to a formal hearing on the merits, which was conducted by the hearing committee
  on June 25, 2002.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2002-09-18_01-DB-030.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">After reviewing the evidence presented at the hearing, the hearing committee found that
  respondent used his position as an attorney in an abusive manner "to seek some sort of satisfaction from his
  secretary and one of his tenants."  The committee rejected respondent's suggestion in his testimony at the formal
  hearing that he was simply trying to recover "a financial loss" caused by Mrs. Purvis, noting that the numerous
  pleadings in the various suits filed by respondent belie that assertion.  Furthermore, once a judgment was rendered
  against respondent, he continued his legal battle by seeking to annul previous rulings in other cases and sought the
  protection of the bankruptcy court. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on these factual findings, the committee determined that respondent pursued claims against
  Mrs. Purvis and Mr. Weber with no good faith basis for doing so.  Rather, these meritless claims were solely intended
  to burden third persons, especially Mrs. Purvis.<a name="_ftnref3" class="fn" href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">3</a> The
  committee concluded that respondent's conduct in these matters violated Rules <span class="Rules">3.1</span> and <span class="Rules">4.4</span> of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct, and was prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rules <span class="Rules">8.4(a) and (d)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As aggravating circumstances, the committee recognized "the tenacity with which Respondent
  pursued his claims which were apparently baseless from the beginning," and respondent's personal and emotional
  problems.  The committee also observed that Mrs. Purvis was harmed by ten years of litigation.  In mitigation, the
  committee recognized that respondent has no prior disciplinary record.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Considering these factors, as well as the prior jurisprudence of this court involving similar
  misconduct,<a name="_ftnref4" class="fn" href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">4</a> the committee recommended that respondent
  be suspended from the practice of law for three years.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation, seeking the imposition of
  disbarment; respondent objected to the committee's recommendation and argued that the appropriate sanction is a
  one-year suspension with probation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2003-11-20_01-DB-030.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">After reviewing the record of this matter, the disciplinary board found the hearing committee's
  findings of fact are not manifestly erroneous, and that the committee correctly applied the Rules of Professional
  Conduct.  Respondent knowingly violated duties owed to the legal system by pursuing meritless claims for the purpose
  of harassing Mrs. Purvis and Mr. Weber.  Mrs. Purvis was harmed to the extent that she was involved in protracted
  litigation, and the legal system was burdened with frivolous claims.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The board found the record supports the following mitigating factors: absence of a prior
  disciplinary record, a cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings, imposition of other penalties or
  sanctions, and remorse.  The board also noted in mitigation that respondent is paying Mrs. Purvis from his own funds
  (as opposed to a collateral source such as insurance) and that he has sold his home and rental and vacation
  properties and deposited the proceeds with the Chapter 13 bankruptcy trustee.  The aggravating factors present are
  selfish motive and substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted 1972).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The board noted that the lawyer in <i>Boydell</i> compounded his mishandling of a fee dispute by
  engaging in harassing and vexatious litigation tactics against his former client.  However, respondent herein did not
  fail to segregate and remit funds owed to a client, and his conduct toward Mrs. Purvis was less egregious than
  Boydell's actions toward his client.  Furthermore, respondent has no prior discipline, has cooperated with the
  disciplinary system, and has incurred other substantial sanctions. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on this reasoning, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of
  law for three years, and that he be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court.  La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B).  Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence.  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Quaid</i>,
  94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana
  State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall</i>, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>.  While we
  are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have
  held the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings.  <i>See</i>
  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Caulfield</i>, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d
  714</a></span>; <span class="cite"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94),
  <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">After reviewing the record of this matter, including the voluminous records of the underlying
  litigation between respondent and his former secretary and tenant, we agree with the hearing committee that
  respondent did not act in good faith, but rather with the intent to burden third persons, particularly Mrs. Purvis. 
  Respondent's claims were largely frivolous and were designed to harass Mrs. Purvis for quitting her job. 
  Furthermore, respondent caused Mrs. Purvis significant emotional distress when he engaged in nearly ten years of
  protracted litigation over what should have been a relatively simple administrative matter.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Having found evidence of professional misconduct, we now turn to a determination of the
  appropriate sanction for respondent's actions.  In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary
  proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the
  profession, and deter future misconduct.  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>,
  <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.  The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances.  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent's actions caused actual and substantial harm to Mrs. Purvis, as well as to the legal
  system.  As we recognized in <i>Boydell</i>, the baseline sanction for the perpetuation of vexatious litigation is
  disbarment.  Nevertheless, the mitigating factors present in this case suggest that it is appropriate to deviate
  downward to a three-year suspension.  Respondent has <span class="ABAstandard">no prior disciplinary record in more
  than thirty years of practice</span>, and he has <span class="ABAstandard">cooperated in the disciplinary
  process</span>.  Additionally, he was <span class="ABAstandard">subject to other penalties</span>, in the form of the
  significant award of damages made by the jury to Mrs. Purvis in the malicious prosecution case.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Under the circumstances, we will accept the disciplinary board's recommendation of
  discipline.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Robert W. Stratton, Louisiana Bar Roll number 11596, be suspended from
  the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of three years.  All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed
  against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days
  from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn1" class="fn" href="#_ftnref1" id="_ftn1">1</a> Respondent originally filed suit
  in Livingston Parish, but the matter was subsequently transferred to East Baton Rouge Parish pursuant to a joint
  motion for change of venue.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn2" class="fn" href="#_ftnref2" id="_ftn2">2</a> In addition to the suit against
  Mrs. Purvis for tortious interference with a contract, respondent also filed a series of other lawsuits against Mrs.
  Purvis and/or Mr. Weber, including the following:</p>

  <p class="footnotetext">On September 30, 1992, respondent filed suit against Mr. Weber for tortious interference with
  a contract.  <i>Robert W. Stratton, APLC v. Dennis C. Weber</i>, No. 385,997 on the docket of the 19th Judicial
  District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge.  Respondent voluntarily dismissed this suit in 1993, but a dispute
  arose thereafter with respect to whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice.  In April 1994, the trial court
  awarded sanctions in favor of Mr. Weber and against respondent in the amount of $3,500.  The court of appeal affirmed
  the trial court's judgment and awarded Mr. Weber $1,500 in damages for frivolous appeal; this court denied writs. 
  <i>Robert W. Stratton, APLC v. Dennis C. Weber</i>, 94-1910 (La. App. 1st Cir. 6/23/95), 658 So. 2d 843 (not
  designated for publication), <i>writ denied</i>, 95-1874 (La. 11/3/95), 661 So. 2d 1385.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext">On September 30, 1992, respondent filed suit against Mrs. Purvis and Mr. Weber, claiming they
  were liable for the tortious conversion of his computer files.  <i>Robert W. Stratton, APLC v. Ann C. Purvis and
  Dennis C. Weber</i>, No. 385,998 on the docket of the 19th Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton
  Rouge.  Respondent voluntarily dismissed this suit in 1993.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext">On October 8, 1992, respondent filed suit against Mrs. Purvis for breach of contract,
  alleging that she did not give him telephone messages and thereby caused him to lose clients.  <i>Robert W. Stratton,
  APLC v. Ann C. Purvis</i>, No. 67,171 on the docket of the 21st Judicial District Court for the Parish of
  Livingston.  This suit has been abandoned by respondent.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext">On November 19, 1993, respondent filed suit against Mrs. Purvis for defamation, claiming that
  in her answer to the original lawsuit she "did cause to be published defamatory and false words," including
  allegations that respondent was frequently out of the office and often late in preparing and filing pleadings.
  <i>Robert W. Stratton, APLC v. Ann C. Purvis</i>, No. 70,076 on the docket of the 21st Judicial District Court for
  the Parish of Livingston.  This suit has been abandoned by respondent.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext">On November 9, 1996, respondent filed suit against Mrs. Purvis and Mr. Weber, seeking the
  nullity of various judgments rendered in the earlier cases.  <i>Robert W. Stratton, APLC and Robert W. Stratton, Sr.
  v. Ann C. Purvis and Dennis C. Weber</i>, No. 433,113 on the docket of the 19th Judicial District Court for the
  Parish of East Baton Rouge.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn3" class="fn" href="#_ftnref3" id="_ftn3">3</a> The committee felt that

  <a href="2002-04-12_2001-2836.htm">814 So. 2d 1273</a></span>.  Mr. Boydell and Ms. DuBarry were law partners who
  were sued by a former client in 1986 to recover disputed attorney's fees.  Over the next several years Mr. Boydell
  and Ms. DuBarry filed innumerable bad faith and meritless motions, reconventional demands, and other pleadings in an
  effort to harass and intimidate their client and her counsel.  In 1992, the trial court awarded the client the
  disputed attorney's fees and awarded sanctions against Mr. Boydell and Ms. DuBarry for abuse of process, unethical
  practices, fraud and conversion, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress.  That judgment was affirmed on
  appeal in 1996.  In the disciplinary proceedings that followed thereafter, this court concluded that the baseline
  sanction for perpetuating vexatious litigation is disbarment.  Considering the mitigating factors present in Mr.
  Boydell's case, the court suspended him from the practice of law for three years.  Ms. DuBarry, who was found to be
  less culpable for the institution of the vexatious litigation, was suspended for one year.</p>
