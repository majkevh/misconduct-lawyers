IN RE: CHARLES GRADY<br>
</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>PER CURIAM*</p>
<p>***************************************************************************</p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from one count of formal charges instituted by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) against respondent, Charles Grady, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></font></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In March of 1991, Monica Peters-Morris retained respondent to represent her in connection with a personal injury matter. One year later, respondent filed suit on behalf of his client against the tortfeasor and his insurer.&nbsp; The tortfeasorâ€™s insurer became insolvent in 1993, and the Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association (&quot;LIGA&quot;) was substituted in its place.LIGA advised respondent that Ms. Peters-Morris' uninsured motorist coverage would prime its coverage, and requested that her claim against it be dismissed.&nbsp; Respondent failed to communicate this fact to his client.&nbsp; Over the following three years, respondent led her to believe he was still pursuing her claims.</font></span></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, in November of 1993, respondent became ineligible to practice law due to his failure to comply with the mandatory continuing legal education requirements.' Respondent failed to advise his client of this fact, nor did he terminate his representation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From June, 1995 to March, 1996, lAs. Peters-Morris attempted repeatedly to </font><span class="BodyText2"><font size="3" color="#000000">contact respondent, but he was unable to do so. She contacted the Louisiana State Bar Association and learned for the fast time respondent had been ineligible to practice law. However, when she finally did speak to respondent, she asserted he denied he was ineligible to practice and again attempted to lead her to believe he was handling her case.</font></span></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></font></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subsequently, Ms. Peters-Morris filed a complaint with the ODC.&nbsp; In his response to the ODC, respondent 'categorically denied any allegations&quot; of the complainant. When he later failed to answer the ODC's request for supplemental information, a subpoena was issued compelling his attendance at a scheduled deposition.&nbsp; In his deposition, respondent conceded that Ms Peters-Morris called Ms office, but he failed to return her calls.&nbsp; He testified that once he became ineligible to practice law, he did no further work on Ms. Peters-Morris' case, but admitted that he did not send a disengagement letter. He indicated he did not return her file to her until prompted by the ODC in August, 1996. However, he stated he did not receive any compensation from Ms. Peters-Morris for his services or expenses incurred.</font></span></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thereafter, the ODC instituted formal charges against respondent, alleging several professional violations.</font><font size="3"><sup>2 </sup></font><font size="3"> A hearing was conducted before the committee. Respondent failed to appear or file any response or objection to the proceeding, </font><font size="3">despite receiving notice.&nbsp; Ms. Morris appeared and testified to the facts in the formal charges. The ODC submitted into evidence documentation contradicting respondent's testimony that he had not represented Ms. Morris once he was declared ineligible to practice.</font><font size="3"><sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Abd92?an=JD_HC9818 --##'><font size="3"><b>Hearing Committee Recommendation</b></font></a><font size="3"><b></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hearing committee concluded respondent acted intentionally, and the actual or potential injuries caused were substantial to his client. In support, it noted Ms. Peters-Morris's medical bills have not been paid and she is unsure whether her own insurance carrier will provide coverage for the claim. Relying on the </font><font size="3"><i>ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions,</i></font><font size="3"><sup><i>4</i></sup></font><font size="3"> the </font><font size="3">committee determined</font> the baseline sanction was suspension. <font size="2"> After recognizing the presence of aggravating and mitigating factors,</font><font size="1"><sup>5</sup></font><font size="2"> the committee recommended the respondent be suspended for a period of one year and one day, as well as assessed with all costs.</font></p>
<br>
<p><font size="3"><b>Disciplinary Board Recommendation</b></font></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font size="3" color="#000000">The disciplinary board issued its recommendation to the court concurring in the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee.&nbsp; Relying on the aggravating and mitigating factors and ABA Standards cited by the committee, the disciplinary board also proposed that a one year and one day suspension be imposed.</font></span></p>
<p><font size="3"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the recommendation of the disciplinary board.<br>
</font><font size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font><font size="3">The record supports the findings of fact made by the hearing committee and disciplinary board that respondent committed the professional misconduct as charged.&nbsp; After considering the aggravating and mitigating factors, we conclude that the discipline recommended by the board is appropriate.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>DECREE</b></font></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accordingly, it is ordered that respondent, Charles Grady, be </font><font face='Times New Roman'>suspended</font><font size="3" color="#000000"> from the practice of law </font><font face='Times New Roman'>for a period of one year and one day.</font><font size="3" color="#000000"> All costs and expenses of these proceedings</font><font color="#000000"> are assessed to respondent in accordance with </font></span></p>

Also, on March 9, the respondent wrote to counsel for LIGA, Christopher Lozes, advising of the types of insurance his 'client' had, On March 21, 1995, the respondent again wrote Mr. Lozes stating that he &quot;would prefer to await [the U.M. carrier's] decision regarding my client's claim before voluntarily dismissing her claim against LIGA.&quot; Finally, on March 25, 1995, the respondent wrote to the CDC clerk of court advising of, in his capacity as counsel for Ms. Morris in her lawsuit, his change of address.</font></p>
