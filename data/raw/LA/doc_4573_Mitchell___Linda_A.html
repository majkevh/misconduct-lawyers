<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 02-B-2581</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: LINDA A. MITCHELL</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">This matter arises from a petition for consent discipline filed by the Office of respondent, Linda A. Mitchell, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana. The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) concurs in the proposed consent discipline of a fully 
deferred six month suspension, subject to a one year period of probation with conditions.</p>

<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">These proceedings are based on two separate files investigated by the ODC. The facts, as stipulated to by respondent and the ODC, are as follows:</p>

<h3>Investigative File No. 13242</h3>

<p class="Bodycopy">Denise Albert retained respondent to represent her and her minor son in a personal injury matter stemming from a vehicular accident which took place in September, 1997. While the parties agreed respondent was to be paid on a contingency fee basis, no written agreement was 
executed providing for such. Respondent filed suit on behalf of her clients, but subsequently took little or no action on their behalf. Ms. Albert made several requests for information regarding the status of the legal matter, but to no avail.&nbsp; Ms. Albert filed a complaint with the ODC advising 
of respondent's misconduct. Respondent neglected to answer and, as a result, the ODC issued a subpoena compelling her cooperation. Ms. Albert's case was finally resolved with a judgment in her favor in April, 2002, after the instant consent proceedings were instituted.</p>

<h3>Investigative File No. 13558</h3>

<p class="Bodycopy">Alecha Harris retained respondent to represent her and her minor child in a personal injury matter stemming from an accident which took place in December, 1995. While respondent instituted suit on behalf of her clients, she subsequently took little or no action on their behalf. 
Eventually, the suit was dismissed for abandonment due to respondent's failure to pursue the case. At the same time, respondent neglected to respond to Ms. Harris' numerous requests for information regarding the status of her legal matter. </p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Ms. Harris filed a complaint with the ODC advising of respondent's misconduct. When respondent neglected to respond to the complaint, the ODC issued a subpoena compelling her cooperation.</p>

<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

<h3>Petition for Consent Discipline</h3>

<p class="Bodycopy">Prior to the institution of formal charges by the ODC, respondent filed a joint petition for consent discipline conceding her actions violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, namely, Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (lack of diligence), <span class="Rules">1.4(a)</span> 
(failure to communicate), <span class="Rules">1.5</span> (failure to have a written contingency fee contract), <span class="Rules">3.2</span> (failure to expedite litigation) and <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). In the accompanying stipulation 
of facts, respondent asserted in mitigation that her actions were unintentional and stemmed from her heavy workload as a sole practitioner, an insufficient support staff and medical problems.<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> For her misconduct, respondent proposed she be suspended from the practice of 
law for a period of six months, fully deferred, subject to a one year period of probation, subject to conditions.<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a></p>

<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed a concurrence to and memorandum in support of the petition for consent discipline.</p>

<h3><a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=02-DB-026.BD$t=document-frameset.htm" target="main">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></h3>

<p class="Bodycopy">Because the parties stipulated to the facts and misconduct, the board's sole focus was whether the proposed discipline was an appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct. The board found that respondent negligently violated duties owed to her clients, resulting in actual 
injury insofar as she unnecessarily delayed resolution of Ms. Albert's legal matter and caused Ms. Harris' civil suit to be dismissed. As to respondent's failure to cooperate, it concluded her inaction was knowing and intentional, resulting in actual injury to the profession insofar as she caused 
undue delays and burdens on the disciplinary system. </p>

<p class="Bodycopy">The board recognized multiple offenses as the only aggravating factor. In mitigation, it noted lack of a prior disciplinary record, interim rehabilitation and personal problems. Additionally, the board relied on the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions <a class="fn" 
href="#fn3">3</a> and jurisprudence from this court. Accordingly, the board recommended the proposed consent discipline be adopted and that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six months, fully deferred, subject to a one year period of probation with the conditions cited in the 
consent petition.&nbsp; Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">Although this matter arises from a petition for consent discipline, Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 20(B) provides that the extent of discipline to be imposed is subject to review. In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to 
maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>, <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=513%20So.2d%201173$t=document-frameset.htm" target="main">513 So. 2d 1173</a> 
(La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>,
<a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=459%20So.2d%20520$t=document-frameset.htm" target="main">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">The rule violations in this case, as admitted by respondent, principally involve neglect of a legal matter, failure to expedite litigation, failure to communicate and failure to cooperate with the ODC. While such conduct falls well below the standards expected of Louisiana 
attorneys, it appears many of respondent's problems stemmed from poor practice management skills rather than a dishonest intent. Additionally, significant mitigating factors are present, including respondent's lack of a prior disciplinary record and personal problems.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">The proposed consent discipline is consistent with the sanctions imposed by this court under similar facts. See, e.g., <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Nichols</i>, 00-0102 (La. 2/11/00), <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=752%20So.2d%20153$t=document-frameset.htm" target="main">752 
So. 2d 153</a></span> (six month suspension deferred in full, subject to one year probation imposed on an attorney with no prior disciplinary record for neglect of a legal matter, failure to expedite litigation, failure to communicate and failure to return an unearned fee); <span class="CITE"><i>In 
re: Dejean</i>, 01-0150 (La. 3/16/01), <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=782%20So.2d%20566$t=document-frameset.htm" target="main">782 So. 2d 566</a></span> (one year suspension, deferred in full, subject to a one year probation imposed by consent on an attorney for neglect of a legal matter, failure 
to communicate and failure to cooperate). Given the facts of this case, we believe a deferred suspension, couple with a period of supervised probation with conditions, will address respondent's misconduct and protect the public, while at the same time allowing her to address the deficiencies in her 
practice.&nbsp; Accordingly, we will accept the petition for consent discipline.</p>

<h2>DECREE</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the record filed herein, it is ordered that Linda A. Mitchell be suspended from the practice of law in the State of Louisiana for six months, deferred in full, subject to a one year period 
of supervised probation with conditions, as set forth in the petition for consent discipline. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's 
judgment until paid.</p>
