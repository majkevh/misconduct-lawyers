  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 04-B-1734</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: EDWIN JEROME WILSON</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations of serious
  attorney misconduct by respondent, Edwin Jerome Wilson. Specifically, the ODC's investigation revealed that
  respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence, failed to communicate with clients, failed to timely remit funds
  owed to clients and third parties, converted substantial amounts of client and third party funds to his own use,
  failed to properly withdraw from his representation of his clients and failed to protect the interests of his
  clients. Additionally, the investigation revealed respondent improperly shared fees with a suspended lawyer and
  facilitated the unauthorized practice of law by that lawyer. The investigation also showed respondent engaged in the
  unauthorized practice of law following his interim suspension by this court in <span class="cite"><i>In re:
  Wilson</i>, 04-0861 (La. 4/21/04), <a href="2004-04-21_2004-0861.htm">871 So. 2d 1090</a>.</span></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Prior to the filing of formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for
  consent discipline. The parties stipulate to respondent's misconduct and seek his permanent disbarment from the
  practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on our review of the petition, we conclude respondent has engaged in some of the most
  serious professional infractions an attorney can commit. At least two of the permanent disbarment guidelines set
  forth in Rule XIX, Appendix E are applicable: <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 1</span> ("repeated or multiple
  instances of intentional conversion of client funds with substantial harm") and <span class="Guidelines">Guideline
  8</span> ("following notice, engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. . . during the period of time in which the
  lawyer is suspended from the practice of law or disbarred").</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we find permanent disbarment is an appropriate sanction and we will accept the
  petition for consent discipline.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Joint Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that the name of
  Edwin Jerome Wilson, Louisiana Bar Roll number 24253, be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to
  practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked. Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered
  that respondent be permanently prohibited from being readmitted to the practice of law in this state.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
