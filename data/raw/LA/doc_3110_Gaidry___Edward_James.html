  <p class="headingstyle">LOUISIANA ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NUMBER: 98-DB-038</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: EDWARD JAMES GAIDRY, JR.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">AMENDED RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of formal charges by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel against Edward James Gaidry, Jr.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Formal charges consisting of one count were filed against Respondent on June 8, 1998. 
  Respondent, through his attorney of record, filed an answer on July 15, 1998, in which he generally admitted the
  allegations, but denied that his misconduct was knowing or intentional.  On December 17, 1998, Respondent filed a
  motion for consent discipline, affidavit of consent and a detailed stipulation of facts.  The Office of Disciplinary
  Counsel concurs in the stipulation.  Respondent seeks, and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel recommends, a public
  reprimand for the alleged misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter on January 28, 1999.  The Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel was represented by Deputy Counsel G. Fred Ours; neither Respondent nor his attorney
  appeared.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The formal charges allege that Respondent represented Robert S. Roth in a domestic matter and
  filed a Rule for an Article 102 divorce on October 8, 1996, before the 180-day statutory period expired.  Although
  the Rule was assigned to Judge Pettigrew, who set it for hearing on April 24, 1997, Respondent took the Rule to
  judgment before Judge Walker without service or notice to the opposing party or her counsel.  It is alleged that
  Respondent falsely informed Judge Walker that service had been made and that opposing counsel had been informed and
  had no objection to the granting of the motion.  It is also alleged that Respondent falsely informed Judge Walker
  that Judge Pettigrew had no objection to his granting the motion.  It is alleged that this conduct violates the Rules
  of Professional Conduct <span class="allegedrules">1.1(a)</span>, <span class="allegedrules">1.2(c)</span>,
  <span class="allegedrules">3.1</span>, <span class="allegedrules">3.3(a)(1)</span>(2)(4),
  <span class="allegedrules">3.3(d)</span>, <span class="allegedrules">4.1</span>,
  <span class="allegedrules">4.4</span> and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span>(c)(d).</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX §10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a finding of
  lawyer misconduct, the court or board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <p> (1)whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legalsystem, or to the
  profession;</p>

  <p> (2)whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

  <p> (3)the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

  <p> (4)the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The  Board finds that Respondent is guilty of the misconduct set forth in the formal charges and
  the charges have been proven by clear and convincing evidence, except that the Board finds that Respondent did not
  make any false representations to Judge Walker regarding Judge Pettigrew's position.  The Board finds that Respondent
  has violated duties owed to the legal system and the profession, has engaged in negligent misconduct.  The Board does
  not find the presence of any aggravating factors, but does find as mitigating factors, no prior discipline record and
  remorse.  In consent disciplines, the Board may reject proposed discipline as too lenient, but when Respondent and
  disciplinary counsel have agreed that a violation has occurred, it may not reject consent discipline claiming that
  there was no violation.  <i>See</i> <span class="CITE">In re: Lieberman, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96);
  <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So.2d 272</a>.</span></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> Accordingly, the Disciplinary Board orders that Respondent, Edward James Gaidry, Jr., be issued
  a public reprimand and further orders that  Respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings,
  with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this Ruling until paid.</p>
