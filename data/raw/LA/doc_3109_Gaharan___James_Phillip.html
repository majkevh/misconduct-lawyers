  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: JAMES P. GAHARAN, JR.</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 01-DB-046</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a joint petition for consent discipline
  by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") and James P. Gaharan, Jr. ("Respondent") of Lake Charles, Louisiana, an
  attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana. For reasons stated below, the Disciplinary Board accepts
  the petition and orders a public reprimand be issued against Respondent.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On May 7, 2001, ODC and Respondent filed a joint petition for consent discipline and stipulation
  of facts in this matter. On that same day, ODC filed a memorandum in support of the proposed sanction. No formal
  charges have been filed in this matter.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On June 28, 2001, a panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter. The parties waived
  appearances; therefore, oral argument was not conducted.</p>

  <h2>STIPULATED FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The stipulated facts in this matter provide the following information:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent performed a real estate closing on June 18, 1999, in which Brenda Shelton was the
  seller of the property. Respondent received the funds to pay off a loan of $70,523.55 owed by Ms. Shelton to Resource
  Bancshares Mortgage Group, Inc. ("RBMG"). However, Ms. Shelton later discovered that RBMG had not been paid.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After being informed that RBMG had not been paid, Respondent sent a check to RBMG. This check was
  returned marked "NSF" on August 16, 1999. Respondent explained that this problem arose when he prematurely disbursed
  funds in another closing. Eventually, RBMG received the full payment from Respondent.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"
  class="fn" id="_ednref1">[i]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On a second occasion, on August 31, 1999, Respondent handled another real estate in which Frances
  Fisher was the seller of the property. At the time of the closing, Respondent withheld the cost of updating the title
  abstract and termite inspection from the seller's proceeds. Respondent thereafter failed to timely pay these costs,
  despite repeated demands from the seller's real estate agent. The title abstract company was finally paid on January
  19, 2000, and the pest control company was paid on February 23, 2000.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn"
  id="_ednref2">[ii]</a></p>

  <h2>PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the petition, Respondent admits to violating Rule
  <span class="allegedrules">1.15</span><a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" class="fn" id="_ednref3">[iii]</a> and Rule
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span><a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" class="fn" id="_ednref4">[iv]</a> of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct. The parties propose that a formal public reprimand be issued to Respondent and that
  Respondent be placed on probation for a two-year period, with the following terms and conditions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1)  A probation monitor will be appointed for the two-year period;</p>

    <p class="inverted">2)  Respondent will be monitored by a certified public accountant as
    part of the probation;</p>

    <p class="inverted">3)  The certified public accountant shall conduct quarterly audits of Respondent's client trust
    account during the probationary period and shall report the findings of such audits to the probation monitor;
    and</p>

    <p class="inverted">4)  Respondent shall pay all costs associated with these audits.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.15</span>
  and <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  The Board must accept that Respondent
  has violated these rules.  <span class="cite"><i>In re Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96);
  <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given the violations of these rules, the Board is
  left to determine if the proposed sanction is appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system,
  or to the profession;</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon a review of the record, the Board finds that Respondent has negligently violated
  duties owed to his clients. As a result, Respondent's clients were indirectly harmed by his actions, and third
  parties were directly harmed by being deprived of the funds due them for several months.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The mitigating factors of <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest or selfish
  motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">timely good faith effort to rectify consequences of the misconduct</span>,
  and <span class="ABAstandard">full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board</span> or
  <span class="ABAstandard">cooperative attitude toward these proceedings</span> are present here. The aggravating
  factors of a <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary record</span><a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" class="fn"
  id="_ednref5">[v]</a> and <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span> are also present.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Finally, the proposed sanction is in keeping with the ABA Standards<a href="#_edn6"
  name="_ednref6" class="fn" id="_ednref6">[vi]</a> and prior jurisprudence.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" class="fn"
  id="_ednref7">[vii]</a></p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the joint petition for consent discipline be accepted,
  and that a public reprimand be issued against the Respondent, James P. Gaharan, Jr., and that he be placed on
  probation for a two-year period with the following terms and conditions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1)  A probation monitor will be appointed for the two-year period;</p>

    <p class="inverted">2)  Respondent will be monitored by a certified public accountant as part of the probation;</p>

    <p class="inverted">3)  The certified public accountant shall conduct quarterly audits of Respondent's client trust
    account during the probationary period and shall report the findings of such audits to the probation monitor;
    and</p>

    <p class="inverted">4)  Respondent shall pay all costs associated with these audits.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board also orders that all costs and expenses of these proceedings be assessed to Respondent,
  with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of this order until paid.</p>

  account from the date of the closing through actual receipt of the funds by RBMG on August 24, 1999.</p>

  <div id="dissentWhitehead">
    <p class="headingstyle">DISSENT</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">Jack O. Whitehead, Jr.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">As per the stipulation of facts, there were TWO cases of failure to pay a third party
    provider.In the first one, the Respondent's client forced the issue of non-payment and the matter was not settled
    until two months AFTER the Respondent missed his commitment to pay off a loan. Additionally, when the Respondent
    did send the check to the third party provider IT WAS RETURNED NSF.Regardless of Respondent's explanation to make
    this fact go away, this must be considered as either conversion or commingling of client funds.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">In the second case, the Respondent failed to pay two third party providers - despite REPEATED
    DEMANDS from his client's agent. From the time Respondent withheld funds to pay until both providers were paid,
    nearly six months had elapsed.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">Prior jurisprudence cited to justify a public reprimand dates as far back as 1993.At the
    minimum, the Respondent here was negligent and the behavior was knowing and/or intentional.After a real estate
    closing, Respondent had $70,523.55 in his possession to pay off his client's loan. He did not do so, until forced
    by his client.The check written and processed by the Respondent was returned NSF by the bank. From a factual
    standpoint, how can this NOT BE a conversion of commingling of client funds? It cannot be excused, nor does it fit
    in any other professional context.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">I believe a public reprimand in this case is clearly TOO LENIENT, and therefore, DISSENT.</p>
