<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hearing committee concluded respondent violated the professional rules ascharged.&nbsp; It determined the baseline sanction was disbarment, citing the </font><font size="3"><i>ABA Standards for imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i></font><font size="3"><sup><i>3</i></sup></font><font size="3"> and </font><span class="CITE"><font size="3"><i>Louisiana State Bar Assn v.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="3">&nbsp; Upon consolidating and considering the two cases pending against respondent, the disciplinary board issued its recommendation to the court concurring in the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee.&nbsp; While noting the respondent is currently disbarred from practice, it recommended that respondent be disbarred from practice for the instant misconduct and that his five-year readmission period be extended to run from the date of finality of the court's judgment in this matter. It further recommended that respondent be ordered to make full restitutionand assessed with all costs of these proceedings.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the </font><span class="BodyText"><font color="#000000">recommendation of the disciplinary board.</font></span></p>
<p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font size="3">The record supports the findings of fact made by the hearing committee and disciplinary board that respondent committed the professional misconduct as charged. Respondent knowingly and intentionally neglected legal matters,&nbsp; converted funds from Ms numerous clients, and later failed to provide restitution. This conduct, combined with his lengthy prior disciplinary record,demonstrates respondent lacks the moral fitness to practice law and is a threat to his clients, the profession and the public.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Clearly, this misconduct would justify </font><font face='Times New Roman'>disbarment.</font><font size="3"> Since respondent is already disbarred, we will</font><font face='Times New Roman'> extend </font><font size="3">the minimum period for readmission pursuant to</font><font size="3"> for </font><font face='Times New Roman'>an additional five years</font><font size="3"> from the finality of the instant&nbsp; judgment.</font><span class="CITE">&nbsp; <font size="3"><i>Louisiana State Bar</i></font><font size="3"> </font><font size="3"><i>Ass'n v.

<p><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font size="3">Based on our review of the recommendations of the hearing committee anddisciplinary board, and the record herein, it is the decision of this court that respondent, J.
