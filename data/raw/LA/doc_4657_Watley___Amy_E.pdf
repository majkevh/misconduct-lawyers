id="_ftnref1">1</a></p>

<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

<h3>Count I - The Beckham Matter</h3>

<h3>Count III - The Guillory Matter</h3>

<p class="bodycopy">In February 1999, Charles Guillory retained respondent to handle a personal injury matter.&nbsp; Respondent agreed to accept the case on a contingency fee basis, but thereafter she failed to complete the matter and abandoned her law practice without protecting the interests of 
her client.</p>

<h3>Count IV - The Berry Matter</h3>

<p class="bodycopy">In November 1999, George Berry paid respondent $750 to represent him in a child custody proceeding.&nbsp; Respondent failed to complete the matter and abandoned her law practice without protecting the interests of her client.</p>

<h3>Count V - The Brown Matter</h3>

<p class="bodycopy">Liza Ann Brown retained respondent to represent her in a divorce proceeding. Ms. Brown paid respondent a retainer fee; however, respondent failed to complete the matter and abandoned her law practice without protecting the interests of her client.</p>

<h3>Count VI - The Greene Matter</h3>

<p class="bodycopy">In December 1999, Deborah Greene retained respondent to represent her in a divorce proceeding.&nbsp; Ms. Greene paid respondent a retainer fee; however, respondent failed to complete the matter and abandoned her law practice without protecting the interests of her client.</p>

<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

<p class="bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed six counts of formal charges against respondent, alleging that her conduct violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client) and <span class="Rules">1.16</span> 
(termination of the representation) of the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges.&nbsp; Accordingly, the factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 11(E)(3).&nbsp; No formal hearing was held, 
but the parties were given an opportunity to file with the hearing committee written arguments and documentary evidence on the issue of sanctions.</p>

<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-033.HC --#">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></h3>

<p class="bodycopy">Noting the factual allegations of the formal charges were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Rule XIX, &sect; 11(E)(3), the hearing committee agreed that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged.&nbsp; After consideration of 
the ODC's submission in response to the deemed admitted order,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" class="fn" id="_ftnref2">2</a> the committee concluded that respondent accepted cases but did not complete the work or communicate with her clients, and left no way for her clients or the ODC to reach her.&nbsp; 
The committee found respondent's conduct was knowing and caused injury to her clients, the profession, and the disciplinary system.&nbsp; The committee recognized no mitigating factors, but determined numerous aggravating factors are present, namely respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">prior 
disciplinary offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the victims</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in 
the practice of law</span> (admitted 1993).&nbsp; Under these circumstances, the committee recommended that respondent be disbarred.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation.&nbsp; However, on March 27, 2002, the day before this matter was scheduled to be considered by the disciplinary board, respondent submitted a handwritten response to five of the six 
counts of formal charges, essentially denying any misconduct.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-033.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>

<p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board agreed respondent violated duties owed to her clients and as a professional.&nbsp; The board further determined that respondent's conduct was knowing, if not intentional, and caused injury to her clients.&nbsp; The baseline sanction for this conduct is 
disbarment.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">The board concurred in the aggravating factors cited by the committee, and agreed the record does not support a finding of any mitigating factors.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">In light of these considerations, the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, and the prior jurisprudence, the board concluded that disbarment is the appropriate sanction.&nbsp; The board also recommended respondent be ordered to make restitution to her clients, and 
that she be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of the court's judgment until paid.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

<p class="bodycopy">The deemed admitted facts in this case establish that respondent has neglected the legal matters of six clients and has abandoned her law practice without protecting the interests of her clients.&nbsp; Therefore, the sole issue presented for our consideration is the appropriate 
sanction for respondent's misconduct.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct.&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar 
Ass'n v. Reis</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:513 So.2d 1173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.&nbsp; The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.&nbsp;
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:459 So.2d 520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">In cases involving neglect and abandonment of multiple clients, we have frequently held that disbarment is an appropriate sanction.&nbsp; <i>See</i> <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Poirrier</i>, 01-1116, 01-1118 (La. 6/29/01), <a href="#!-- #ID:791 So.2d 94 --#">791 So. 2d 94</a></span>;
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Smith</i>, 98-619, 98-620 (La. 5/8/98), <a href="#!-- #ID:710 So.2d 241 --#">710 So. 2d 241</a></span>.&nbsp; Numerous aggravating factors are present in the instant case, including respondent's prior disciplinary record, dishonest or selfish motive, bad faith 
obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding, vulnerability of the victims, and substantial experience in the practice of law.&nbsp; We are unable to discern any mitigating factors from the record.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">We conclude the record demonstrates in a convincing fashion that respondent lacks the fitness necessary to practice law in this state. She must be disbarred.</p>

<h2>DECREE</h2>

<p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that the name of Amy E. Watley, Louisiana Bar Roll number 22223, be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that her license to practice law 
in the State of Louisiana be revoked.&nbsp; It is further ordered that respondent render a full accounting to Susan Ann Beckham, Brenda Hatfield, Charles Guillory, George Berry, Liza Ann Brown, and Deborah Greene and that she refund any unearned fees due those clients.&nbsp; All costs and expenses 
in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
