  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE:  ERMENCE DEBOSE-PARENT</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 03-DB-012</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE LOUISIANA ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a petition for consent discipline by
  Ermence Debose-Parent ("Respondent") of New Orleans, Louisiana, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of
  Louisiana. The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") has concurred in the petition. No formal charges have been
  filed in this matter. For reasons stated below, the Disciplinary Board accepts the petition and orders that a public
  reprimand be issued against Respondent, with the condition that within one year from the date of this ruling,
  Respondent attend and successfully complete the Louisiana State Bar Association's Ethics School.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On February 25, 2003, prior to the institution of formal charges, Respondent filed a petition for
  consent discipline, affidavit of consent, and a waiver of opportunity to withdraw consent; ODC filed its concurrence
  in the consent discipline and memorandum in support of the proposed sanction; and the parties filed a joint
  stipulation of facts.  In the petition, Respondent suggests that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction for
  her violation of Rule <span class="allegedrules">1.8(h)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<a href="#_ftn1"
  name="_ftnref1" class="fn" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A panel of the Board reviewed this matter on July 31, 2003. The parties waived appearances,
  therefore, oral argument was not held.</p>

  <h2> STIPULATION OF FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The stipulation of facts filed in this matter provides the following information relevant to
  Respondent's misconduct:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>* * * *</p>

    <p>On December 7, 1998, Complainant, Rosalie B. Barbarin, contacted Respondent's office and requested
    representation for a slip and fall accident she had two days earlier in a Wal-Mart store. On December 8, 1998, the
    Complainant and Respondent signed a Contingency Fee Agreement. During the early months of 1999, Respondent gathered
    information and forwarded available medicals to the claims adjuster for Wal-Mart. Upon receiving a final report and
    bill from the doctor, Respondent resubmitted the written settlement offer in November of 1999. Between mid-November
    and early December, several conversations took place between the claims adjuster and Respondent in an attempt to
    reach an acceptable settlement offer.</p>

    <p>In late-November of 1999, Respondent's law clerk prepared the Petition for Damages. Respondent reviewed it,
    specifically noting that the parish was wrong and needed to be changed to Jefferson Parish. However, Respondent
    signed the signature page as all that was needed to be corrected was the first page. On December 6, 1999,
    Respondent's law clerk fax-filed the Petition to Orleans Parish Civil District Court, in Respondent's absence.
    After Wal-Mart was served, its counsel filed an exception of improper venue. Thereafter, after having the case
    transferred to Jefferson [P]arish, Wal-Mart filed an exception of prescription, which was briefed and argued. The
    court granted the exception, dismissing the suit with prejudice. Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration with
    a second Memorandum and the Court denied the reconsideration. A motion for appeal was timely filed by Respondent.
    The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's judgment.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Barbarin was informed of what had happened after the first exception was filed in early 2000. Mrs. Barbarin
    was contacted by phone and kept informed throughout the proceedings as to what the [courts' rulings] were. After
    the Fifth Circuit's decision, Respondent met with Complainant in person and went through the entire scenario with
    her, from beginning to end. Respondent apologized to Complainant for what had happened.</p>

    <p>Thereafter, Respondent explained to the Complainant her intention to pay the claim and requested that Mrs.
    Barbarin gather all receipts for any out-of-pocket expenses so that they could determine the total amount of her
    damages. Respondent also informed the Complainant that she could obtain another attorney to explain to her
    Respondent's liability. She declined and said that she would get back with Respondent. Subsequently, Complainant
    came into Respondent's office, entered into a settlement agreement wherein she would receive $8,000.00 for her
    damages plus out-of-pocket expenses and Respondent would also take care of the medical bill. The agreement totaled
    $12,435.00. Mrs. Barbarin was paid in full and the medical bill was paid. Respondent bore all of the costs of the
    proceedings from the time it was transferred to Jefferson Parish throughout the appeals court decision. Respondent
    sincerely regrets the turn of events in this matter because her clients put their trust in her to be their
    advocate. Respondent takes that obligation very seriously and will do whatever it is in her power to prevent this
    from occurring again.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><b> APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rule
  <span class="Rules">1.8(h)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  The Board must accept that Respondent has
  violated this rule.  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96);
  <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given the rule violation, the Board is left to
  determine if the proposed sanction of public reprimand is appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX &sect;10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a finding of
  lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) Whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2) Whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) The amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) The existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board finds that Respondent violated duties owed to her client.  Respondent and ODC assert
  that Respondent's violation was unintentional. Based upon the definitions provided in the ABA's <i>Standards for
  Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, Respondent's actions were negligent.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> There appears to be little, if any, injury to Respondent's client.<a href="#_ftn3"
  name="_ftnref3" class="fn" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The parties assert that substantial experience in the practice of law is the sole aggravating
  factor present here.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" class="fn" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> However, a review of the
  Board's records show that Respondent received an admonition in 1997 for a violation of Rule 1.3 (lack of
  diligence).<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" class="fn" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a> <span class="CITE">Board Docket No.
  97-ADB-038</span>. Accordingly, the Board finds that the aggravating factors of a prior disciplinary
  record<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" class="fn" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a> and substantial experience in the practice of
  law are present.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The parties assert that the following mitigating factors exist: <span class="ABAstandard">absence
  of a dishonest or selfish motive</span> and <span class="ABAstandard">full and free disclosure to the disciplinary
  board</span>.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" class="fn" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a> The Board adopts these factors in
  mitigation of Respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <h2>DETERMINATION OF BASELINE SANCTION</h2>

  <h3>I. ABA Standards</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's Standards to determine the baseline sanction by
  "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's mental state and the extent of the injury caused; and then adjust the
  sanction in accordance with the aggravating and mitigating factors present."  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Quaid</i>,
  94-1316 (La. 11/30/94); <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343, 350</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The commentary to Standard 2.5 provides that "[a] reprimand is appropriate in cases where the
  lawyer's conduct, although violating ethical standards, is not serious enough to warrant suspension or disbarment."
  Here, Respondent has violated ethical standards; however, given the absence of any significant harm to her client,
  Respondent's misconduct is not serious enough to warrant suspension or disbarment.</p>

  <h3>II. Relevant Case Law</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board also looks to relevant case law for assistance in determining an appropriate sanction
  for violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. As the prior Louisiana disciplinary cases involving misconduct
  similar to that in which the Respondent has engaged involved additional violations of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct, they provide limited guidance here.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">For instance, in the matter of <span class="CITE"><i>In re Dunn</i>, 98-0535 (La. 6/5/98),
  <a href="../SC/1998-06-05_1998-0535.htm">713 So. 2d 461</a></span>, the Court imposed a deferred six-month suspension
  for the attorney's misconduct, which included trying to monetarily settle liability with his client without
  suggesting that the client seek advice from independent counsel.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In this matter, Respondent's misconduct does not include additional rule violations as seen in
  <i>Dunn</i>.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" class="fn" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a> Additionally, in <i>Dunn</i> the Board
  found several additional mitigating factors were present.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref9">[9]</a> Therefore, a public reprimand is appropriate to address Respondent's misconduct in this
  matter.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the petition for consent discipline be accepted, and
  that a public reprimand be issued against the respondent, Ermence Debose-Parent, Louisiana Bar Roll number 20534,
  with the condition that within one year from the date of this ruling, Respondent attend and successfully complete the
  Louisiana State Bar Association's Ethics School. It is further ordered that Respondent be assessed the costs and
  expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this
  Ruling until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" class="fn" id="_ftn1">[1]</a> Rule 1.8 is entitled "Conflict
  of Interest: Prohibited Transactions" and provides in pertinent part:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">* * *</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(h) A lawyer shall not make an agreement prospectively limiting the lawyer's liability to a
    client for malpractice unless permitted by law and the client is independently represented in making the agreement,
    or settle a claim for such liability with an unrepresented client or former client without first advising that
    person in writing that independent representation is appropriate in connection therewith.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">* * *</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" class="fn" id="_ftn2">[2]</a> According to the ABA
  Standards, negligence is "the failure of a lawyer to heed a substantial risk that circumstances exist or that a
  result will follow, which failure is a deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable lawyer would exercise in
  the situation." Knowledge is defined as "the conscious awareness of the nature or attendant circumstances of the
  conduct but without the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result." Intent is defined as "the
  conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result."</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" class="fn" id="_ftn3">[3]</a> In its concurrence, ODC
  states:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">While the rule violation exposed the client to potential harm, the facts appear to be that
    the client received $8,000.00, her medical expenses were paid by the Respondent, and the Respondent bore the court
    costs. Considering the nature of the client's personal injury claim, a slip and fall in a Wal-Mart store, it is
    certainly arguable that the end result here for the Complainant is that she probably received more money than she
    might have if the case had proceeded normally. While this in no way excuses the Respondent's misconduct, it does
    argue against actual harm to the Complainant.</p>
