  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">LOUISIANA ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE:  ARTHUR A. LEMANN III</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 00-DB-084</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a Joint Petition for Consent Discipline
  (herein "Petition") by the Respondent, Arthur A. Lemann III (herein "Respondent"), of New Orleans, Louisiana, and the
  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (herein "ODC") prior to the filing of formal charges.  The Board accepts the Joint
  Petition and orders a public reprimand be issued against Respondent.</p>

  <h2><b>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On July 12, 2000, prior to the filing of Formal Charges, Respondent and the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel filed a Joint Petition for Consent Discipline and a Joint Stipulation of Facts. Both parties
  recommended Respondent receive a public reprimand. On September 1, 2000, Respondent filed a Memorandum in Support of
  Petition. On September 28, 2000, a panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter. Deputy Counsel G. Fred Ours
  represented the ODC. Mr. Robert S. Glass represented Respondent</p>

  <h2><b>STIPULATED FACTS</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In November of 1996, Respondent undertook the representation of Benjamin Bura Rayburn, Sr. in
  connection with the criminal charges set forth in a federal grand jury indictment. The fee agreement between the
  parties consisted of an hourly rate of $275.00, plus expenses, with a cap of $70,000 on the hourly fee. Mr. Rayburn
  paid Respondent the $70,000 in three installments. However, there was no discussion between the parties regarding the
  "provisions of the state law to pay defense fees," which had to be authorized by specific act of the Legislature,
  pursuant to LSA-R.S. 13:5108.3, et seq. In addition, the fee agreement was not in writing.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In February or March of 1997, prior to the criminal trial, Respondent became aware of this
  statute. At a time near the conclusion of the trial, Respondent may have mentioned this statute to Mr. Rayburn, but
  this did not result in an agreement or written contract. However, Respondent states he believed in good faith that
  Mr. Rayburn agreed to change the capped fee to an open-ended hourly fee and that Mr. Rayburn would be indemnified by
  the State should he be acquitted. Mr. Rayburn denies these allegations. Thereafter, Respondent, consistent with his
  belief, continued to record and bill his hourly work even though the $70,000.00 cap had been reached.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Following Mr. Rayburn's acquittal in June of 1997, Respondent submitted a final invoice in the
  amount of $192,359.37. This amount was based upon Respondent's total hours expended in the criminal case, less a
  credit for the amount paid by Mr. Rayburn.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  In July of 1997, Respondent drafted a proposed lawsuit for declaratory relief against the State
  of Louisiana, wherein he requested Mr. Rayburn seek payment from the Legislature in the amount of $295,472.39,
  consisting of $262,359.37 set forth in Respondent's final invoice and an additional $29,053.57 Mr. Rayburn had paid
  to another attorney who had represented him prior to November of 1996. Although Mr. Rayburn refused to participate in
  that lawsuit and refused to request that the Legislature pay any amount in excess of the original $70,000 capped fee,
  he sought and received payment from the State of Louisiana in the amount of $99,053.57, consisting of the amount
  previously paid to Respondent and the amount previously paid to the other attorney.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In March of 1998, Respondent sued Mr. Rayburn in the 19<sup>th</sup> Judicial District Court for
  the $192,359.37 he alleged was due on the renegotiated fee agreement. The parties entered into stipulated facts and
  the court issued a judgment with written reasons dismissing Respondent's claim.</p>

  <h2><b>REQUEST FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE AND CONCURRENCE BY ODC</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> Based upon the Petition and the stipulated facts, ODC asserts that Respondent's conduct violated
  duties owed to the public, the profession, and his client. Respondent agrees that his conduct violated Rule
  <span class="allegedrules">1.5(b)</span><a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" class="fn" id="_ednref1">[i]</a>
  (communication of the basis for the fee).  The Petition contains no references to aggravating or mitigating factors. 
  Respondent tenders a conditional admission to the misconduct in exchange for a public reprimand. ODC concurs with the
  consent discipline.</p>

  <h2> <b>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p> 1. whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the
    profession;</p>

    <p>2. whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p>3. the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p>4. the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board finds that the Respondent has violated duties owed to the public, the legal system and
  the profession.  The Respondent's actions in this matter were negligent.  Further, the Board finds that the
  Respondent's failure to provide Mr. Rayburn with accurate or complete information relating to the basis of the fee
  charged caused potential injury to his client. The injury caused by the litigation filed by Respondent against Mr.
  Rayburn included substantial adverse publicity that reflected poorly on the profession.  The parties have also
  stipulated that any financial injury sustained by Mr. Rayburn as a result of the litigation was resolved and settled
  to his satisfaction at the time the court's judgment was issued. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As previously noted, there are no aggravating or mitigating factors specifically outlined in the
  Petition. However, a review of the record supports a finding that the aggravating factor of 9.22(i)
  (<span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>) and mitigating factors of 9.32(a)
  (<span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>), 9.32(e)
  (<span class="ABAstandard">cooperative attitude toward proceedings</span>), and 9.32(l)
  (<span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>) are present in this matter.</p>

  <h2><b>ANALYSIS</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rule
  <span class="Rules">1.5(b)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  The Board must accept that Respondent has
  violated this rule. <i> </i><span class="cite">In re Lieberman</span><span class="cite">, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96);
  <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given the violation of Rule 1.5(b), the Board is
  left to determine if the proposed sanction of a public reprimand is appropriate.  The Louisiana Supreme Court relies
  on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> to determine the baseline sanction by "the type of duty
  violated, the lawyer's mental state and the extent of the injury caused; and then adjust the sanction in accordance
  with the aggravating and mitigating factors present."  <span class="cite"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94);
  <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So.2d 343, 350</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The proposed sanction is in line with the ABA guidelines.  Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.63</span> provides for reprimand when "a lawyer negligently fails to provide a client
  with accurate or complete information, and causes actual or potential injury to the client."  Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">7.3</span> provides for reprimand when "a lawyer negligently engages in conduct that is a
  violation of a duty owed to the profession and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, or the
  legal system."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent violated his duty to his client, the public, and the legal profession by negligently
  failing to adequately communicate to his client the proposed change in his hourly fee schedule. As noted earlier, the
  injury caused by the litigation filed by Respondent against Mr. Rayburn included substantial adverse publicity that
  reflected poorly on the profession.  Any financial injury sustained by Rayburn as a result of Respondent's conduct
  was resolved and later settled to Mr. Rayburn's satisfaction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Research into this matter has revealed only one case with a specific reference to a violation of
  Rule 1.5(b), <span class="cite"><i>In re Queyrouze</i>, Board Docket No.
  <a href="1996-06-28_95-DB-040.htm">95-DB-040</a></span>. In that case, ODC filed formal charges, consisting of two
  counts, against the attorney. Count I charged that the attorney failed to have a signed written contingency contract,
  failed to communicate the basis of the fee, failed to give an accounting for the fee, and charged an excessive and
  unreasonable fee. Count II charged that the attorney failed to make prompt and proper remittance of the funds owed to
  the client.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Following the filing of the formal charges, the parties filed a joint petition for consent
  discipline and the record was submitted for review. The hearing committee found that the attorney had presented a
  contingent fee contract to the client for signature, but that the client had failed to return an executed contract to
  the attorney. In spite of this, the attorney proceeded with the representation, ultimately settling the matter. The
  Board publicly reprimanded the attorney "for his oversight in failing to have his former client execute a contingent
  fee contract" in accordance with Rule 1.5(c), which states in part that a contingency fee contract shall be in
  writing.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">While the instant matter can readily be distinguished from <i>Queyrouze</i>, the fact that the
  Board imposed a sanction of public reprimand in a matter involving multiple counts of alleged misconduct - including
  an alleged violation of Rule 1.5(b) - supports the conclusion that the misconduct in this matter does not warrant a
  more substantial discipline.  Therefore, the appropriate baseline sanction is public reprimand.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  The aggravating and mitigating factors noted by the Board do not justify an upward deviation
  from the proposed sanction of public reprimand.</p>

  <h2><b>RULING</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the petition for consent discipline be accepted, and
  that a public reprimand be issued against the respondent, Arthur A. Lemann III, for his violations of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct. It is further ordered that Respondent be assessed the costs and expenses of these proceedings,
  with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this ruling until paid.</p>
