  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, Michael H. O'Keefe, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana but currently on
  interim suspension.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></p>

  <h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Before we examine the current disciplinary charges, we find it helpful to review respondent's
  prior disciplinary history.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in Louisiana in 1955. In 1983, respondent was
  convicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana of one count of mail fraud and
  two counts of obstruction of justice arising from the sale of an apartment building. On December 22, 1983,
  respondent's conviction was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. United States v.
  O'Keefe, 722 F.2d 1175 (5 th Cir. 1983).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Following the finality of his conviction, respondent filed a petition for consent discipline with
  this court, seeking to be disbarred. On December 7, 1984, in an unpublished order, we accepted respondent's petition
  and ordered him disbarred, retroactive to December 22, 1983.
2</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Thereafter, respondent applied for readmission. On April 7, 1989, we granted respondent's
  application for readmission . In re: O'Keefe, 541 So. 2d 843 (La. 1989).</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <h3>The Felony Conviction Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In early 1991, Physicians National Risk Retention Group ("PNRRG"), a Louisiana medical
  malpractice insurer, began to experience financial problems that ultimately resulted in its liquidation. Respondent
  operated the company that was retained to manage PNRRG during this period of time. As part of the liquidation, and
  under the pretext of arranging for continued malpractice insurance coverage to protect the physicians insured by
  PNRRG, respondent arranged to have more than $10 million in cash assets of PNRRG transferred to his law firm's trust
  account. In fact, however, the insurance coverage was not maintained and claims were not paid for the insured
  physicians as promised. Instead, respondent and his cohorts diverted in excess of $7.5 million in assets of PNRRG to
  themselves personally and to companies they controlled.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 1995, a federal grand jury returned a multi-count indictment charging respondent and others
  with conspiracy, mail and wire fraud, and money laundering in connection with the fraudulent insurance scheme. United
  States v. Michael O'Keefe, Sr., et al., No. 95-0106 on the Criminal Docket of the United States District Court for
  the Eastern District of Louisiana. On March 21, 1996, a jury found respondent guilty of conspiracy to commit mail
  fraud and wire fraud, a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 (as to Count 1); wire fraud, a violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343
  and 1341 (as to Counts 2, 4, and 5-8); and money laundering, a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(2)(A) (as to Counts
  14-23).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On January 12, 1999, respondent was sentenced to serve 235 months in prison and was ordered to
  pay restitution to PNRRG in the amount of $1,174,849. On August 11, 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the
  Fifth Circuit affirmed respondent's conviction in an unpublished opinion. On June 11, 2001, the United States Supreme
  Court denied respondent's petition for writ of certiorari; his conviction became final on August 6, 2001, upon the
  Supreme Court's denial of rehearing in the matter.</p>

  <h3>The Solicitation Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The following recitation is based on the factual findings of the hearing committee, as well as
  the testimony and other evidence in the record.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Following respondent's 1983 felony conviction and his readmission to the bar in 1989, respondent
  resumed the practice of law with the New Orleans law firm of O'Keefe, O'Keefe &amp; Bernstein.<a name="fnref2"
  class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a> By all indications, the firm enjoyed a successful practice concentrated primarily in
  the defense of insurance companies and the Housing Authority of New Orleans. However, by the mid-1990's, the firm's
  traditional practice base began to decline as political regimes in New Orleans changed and several insurance carriers
  doing business in Louisiana failed or relocated.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Meanwhile, over the years, certain unscrupulous attorneys in the greater New Orleans area had
  begun using persons known as "runners" to locate potential accident victims.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3"
  id="fnref3">3</a> The practice was largely conducted in the open and was carried out with little fear of consequence
  or reprisal. The runners, who often earned as much as $600 cash for each person brought to a lawyer's office, spoke
  openly and publicly about their business. In time, this information came to be known by Ernest Aiavolasiti, who had
  previously worked as a legal assistant for a personal injury lawyer. Mr. Aiavolasiti realized that with his prior law
  firm experience, he could enter this business and thereby generate substantial income for himself, the runners, and
  the attorneys from whose office they operated.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Sometime in 1994, Mr. Aiavolasiti contacted his long-time friend, Michael Palmisano, about
  joining him in the plan. Mr. Aiavolasiti explained to Mr. Palmisano that in order to bring the plan to fruition, they
  would need to find a cooperating lawyer with start-up funds to pay the runners as well as the legitimate costs of
  funding the personal injury cases. Mr. Palmisano agreed to contact respondent, who years earlier had loaned him money
  for a business venture, to see if he might be interested in participating in the plan.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent agreed to meet with Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano, and after the operations were
  explained, he decided to participate. According to testimony in the record, respondent agreed to provide the law
  office, funding for the payment of runners, and "case development costs," as well as attorneys to try the cases that
  could not be settled. In exchange, respondent was to receive (through entities he owned or controlled) the legal fees
  generated from the settlement of the personal injury cases. Furthermore, loans and advances to clients were to be
  provided by finance companies owned or controlled by respondent, charging up to 36% interest and providing an
  additional source of cash flow to respondent. For their part, Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano would work in the law
  office as salaried "legal assistants" and were promised a bonus from profits.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was apparently concerned about processing these new personal injury cases through
  O'Keefe, O'Keefe &amp; Bernstein, as that firm was traditionally a defense firm. Accordingly, respondent approached
  Greer Goff, a young associate of the O'Keefe firm, about creating a separate law firm known as the "Law Offices of
  Greer Goff." Respondent explained to Ms. Goff that Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano were paralegals with "their own
  cases" to bring to her firm. Ms. Goff's role would be to try those cases that Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano could
  not settle out of court. Ms. Goff did not question this explanation and agreed to do as respondent asked.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano then began spreading the word to local runners that a new
  personal injury office was open for business. Slowly, but progressively faster,<a name="fnref4" class="fn" href="#fn4"
  id="fnref4">4</a> potential clients were brought by the runners to the third floor of the Canal Street building
  housing the O'Keefe, O'Keefe &amp; Bernstein firm. After paying the runners in cash from funds provided to them by
  respondent, Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano screened the cases and retained the clients on behalf of the "Law
  Offices of Greer Goff."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano referred the clients for medical treatment, negotiated
  settlements, and distributed the settlement funds to the clients. In the overwhelming number of cases, the clients
  never saw or spoke with Ms. Goff or any other lawyer; when questions arose in the course of the operation, Mr.
  Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano directed them to respondent. The legal fees generated by the personal injury cases were
  paid to O'Keefe &amp; O'Keefe, A.P.L.C., an entity owned by respondent, as well as to O'Keefe, O'Keefe &amp;
  Bernstein, an entity owned almost entirely by O'Keefe &amp; O'Keefe, A.P.L.C.<a name="fnref5" class="fn" href="#fn5"
  id="fnref5">5</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, certain doctors in the New Orleans area began paying kickbacks in the form of
  "referral fees" to lawyers who agreed to send injured claimants to their offices for medical treatment. Mr.
  Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano relayed that information to respondent, and pursuant to his instructions, they began
  referring some of their clients to Dr. Mark Schwaiger, a chiropractor willing to make such payments.<a name="fnref6"
  class="fn" href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a> Respondent kept two-thirds of the referral fees paid by Dr. Schwaiger for himself,
  while Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano split the remainder.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This arrangement continued for approximately two years. However, at some point, Ms. Goff began to
  realize that Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano were not only working on "their own cases," as originally
  contemplated, but were also acquiring new personal injury cases and using her name to do so. Ms. Goff confronted
  respondent, told him that she was no longer comfortable with the arrangement, and threatened to quit the firm.
  Respondent placated Ms. Goff for a period of time by promising to address her concerns, but the practice nevertheless
  continued. Eventually, Ms. Goff resigned from the firm. At about the same time, Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano
  left respondent's employ because the bonuses they had been promised had never materialized.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In April 1996, respondent approached his law partner, Stephen Bernstein, with a proposal that Mr.
  Bernstein create the "Law Offices of Stephen Bernstein" to serve as a vehicle for continuing the lucrative
  runner-based operation. Mr. Bernstein agreed, and within a relatively short time, the new firm was bringing in
  between 180 and 220 new personal injury clients per month. While the cash flow generated by the personal injury
  business provided a source of funds to pay runners and "case development costs," Mr. Bernstein still turned to
  respondent from time to time to provide capital for the operation. In turn, the legal fees generated by the personal
  injury cases were largely distributed to O'Keefe &amp; O'Keefe, A.P.L.C. and O'Keefe, O'Keefe &amp; Bernstein. The
  finance companies owned or controlled by respondent continued to provide funding for client advances, reaping 36%
  returns from clients. Finally, respondent maintained his "referral fee" relationship with Dr. Schwaiger, who met
  personally with respondent to discuss the arrangement and made those payments directly to him.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The scheme finally came to light in mid-1997, when the ODC commenced an in-depth investigation of
  the runner-based solicitation industry in New Orleans. As a result of this investigation, several disciplinary
  proceedings (and in some cases federal criminal proceedings) were instituted against the
  participants.<a name="fnref7" class="fn" href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed formal charges against respondent arising out of his felony conviction, alleging
  that his conduct constituted a violation of Rules 8.4(a) (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct), 8.4(b)
  (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on a lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer),
  and 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the solicitation matter, the ODC alleged that respondent's conduct violated Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">5.5(b)</span> (assisting a non-lawyer in the performance of an activity that constitutes
  the unauthorized practice of law), <span class="allegedrules">7.2(a)</span> (improper solicitation of professional
  employment by a lawyer or through others acting at his request or on his behalf),
  <span class="allegedrules">7.2(d)</span> (a lawyer shall not give anything of value to a person for recommending the
  lawyer's services), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span>, <span class="allegedrules">8.4(b)</span>, and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span>.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2002-12-23_02-DB-039.htm">Recommendation of the Hearing Committee (Felony
  Conviction Matter)</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Prior to a hearing on the formal charges, respondent filed a petition for consent discipline in
  which he sought the imposition of disbarment for his conviction. The ODC concurred in the petition, and the
  disciplinary board recommended the proposed discipline be accepted. However, on April 24, 2002, we rejected the
  petition for consent discipline and remanded the matter for consideration of the previously filed formal charges. Our
  order further instructed that on remand, "the hearing committee and disciplinary board may consider recommendation of
  the sanction of permanent disbarment, if appropriate, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, §§ 10(a) and 24, as amended
  effective August 1, 2001." In re: O'Keefe, 01-1643 (La. 4/24/02), 814 So. 2d 1288.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">By agreement of the parties, no formal hearing was conducted on remand and the matter was
  considered on documentary evidence alone. The hearing committee found the formal charges were proven by clear and
  convincing evidence and recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2002-12-27_00-DB-080.htm">Recommendation of the Hearing Committee (Solicitation
  Matter)</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After some delays related to discovery issues, this matter proceeded to a formal hearing on the
  merits, which was conducted by the hearing committee on May 20, 2002. The ODC submitted documentary evidence in
  support of the formal charges and called Ernest Aiavolasiti, Michael Palmisano, Greer Goff, Stephen Bernstein, and 
  Dr. Mark Schwaiger, among others, to testify before the committee. Respondent was incarcerated at the time of the
  hearing and thus did not appear in person. He elected not to retain counsel to represent him at the hearing and
  called no witnesses on his behalf. However, respondent submitted written questions which were posed to the ODC's
  witnesses by the hearing committee chairman on cross-examination.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">At the conclusion of the hearing, the committee found respondent violated Rule 7.2(a) by
  soliciting clients for his personal injury practice though the use of runners. The committee further found respondent
  violated Rule 7.2(d) by paying runners and other non-lawyers to obtain clients for his personal injury practice.
  Additionally, the committee found respondent violated Rule 5.5(b) by assisting Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano in
  the unauthorized practice of law. The committee determined respondent violated Rule 8.4(a) by violating the Rules of
  Professional Conduct, both personally and through Mr. Bernstein. Finally, the committee found respondent committed a
  criminal act, and thus violated Rule 8.4(b), when he paid Mr. Aiavolasiti, Mr. Palmisano, and runners to procure
  cases for his firm.<a name="fnref8" class="fn" href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee found respondent's conduct violated duties owed to clients, to the legal system,
  and the profession. Given the extensive planning involved, respondent's actions were clearly intentional. His actions
  resulted in actual and potential injury. It found hundreds of clients were deprived of the considered legal judgment
  of an attorney during the course of their representation. The legal system and the profession suffer actual injury
  when a lawyer engages in runner-based solicitation, a felony under state law. Based on the ABA's Standards for
  Imposing Lawyer Sanctions and the strong public policy expressed by this court in prior solicitation cases, the
  committee determined the baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the committee recognized respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">prior
  disciplinary offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">a pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the victims</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience
  in the practice of law</span> (admitted 1955). The committee found no mitigating factors are present. Under these
  circumstances, and considering the permanent disbarment guidelines set forth in Appendix E to the Rules for Lawyer
  Disciplinary Enforcement, the committee recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2003-11-17_00-DB-080.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the documentary evidence in the record in the felony conviction matter, the board found
  this charge was proven by clear and convincing evidence. The board concluded that permanent disbarment is the
  appropriate sanction. Likewise, the board found the record supports the committee's factual findings in the
  solicitation matter. The board agreed that permanent disbarment is the appropriate sanction for this misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation in the solicitation
  matter only, conceding that permanent disbarment is appropriate in the felony conviction matter. Accordingly, this
  case was docketed for oral argument pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(G)(1)(b).</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). When the disciplinary proceedings involve an attorney who has been convicted of a crime, the conviction is
  conclusive evidence of guilt and the sole issue presented is whether respondent's crimes warrant discipline, and if
  so, the extent thereof. Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 19(E); <span class="cite">In re: Boudreau, 02-0007 (La. 4/12/02),
  <a href="2002-04-12_2002-0007.htm">815 So. 2d 76</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v.
  Wilkinson, <a href="1990-06-04_1989-2016.htm">562 So. 2d 902</a> (La. 1990)</span>. The discipline to be imposed
  depends on the seriousness of the offense and the extent of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Perez, <a href="1989-10-23_1987-1967.htm">550 So. 2d 188</a> (La.
  1989)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was convicted in federal court in 1996 on charges of bilking millions of dollars from
  a failed insurance company. The hearing committee and disciplinary board found, and respondent concedes, that
  permanent disbarment is a proper sanction for this conviction. We agree. Respondent has been convicted of a "serious
  crime," as defined by Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 19, and that conviction was preceded by respondent's disbarment for a
  prior conviction of a serious crime. Permanent disbarment is therefore wholly appropriate under
  <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 9</span> of the permanent disbarment guidelines set forth in Appendix E to the
  Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Ordinarily, this finding would end our inquiry. Because the imposition of permanent disbarment is
  the most severe sanction that can be imposed on a lawyer, having the effect of forever removing the lawyer from the
  bar of this state, there is generally no need to discuss any additional misconduct the lawyer may have committed.
  However, the ODC asks us to make a finding of the appropriate sanction for the solicitation charges, because this
  sanction could become relevant in the event respondent's criminal conviction is reversed in post-conviction
  proceedings. Accordingly, we now address the solicitation matter.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Procedurally, respondent argues that he has been unable to defend the formal charges arising out
  of the runner-based solicitation scheme because he has not been given notice of the misconduct with which he is
  charged. We find no merit to this argument.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <span class="cite">In re Ruffalo, 390 U.S. 544, 550 (1968)</span>, the United States Supreme
  Court held that a lawyer facing discipline is "entitled to procedural due process, which includes fair notice of the
  charge." Likewise, Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E) requires that formal charges of misconduct must "give fair and
  adequate notice of the nature of the alleged misconduct."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A review of the ODC's formal charges in the solicitation matter, as amended on July 13, 2001,
  reveals these charges contain a detailed factual statement of respondent's activities in connection with the
  solicitation matter. The charges allege that respondent's activities, either directly or through the individuals
  named in the formal charges, violated Rules <span class="Rules">7.2(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">7.2(d)</span>,
  <span class="Rules">5.5(b)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(b)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span>, and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span>. These charges unquestionably gave respondent fair and adequate notice of the
  nature of the professional violations alleged by the ODC.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found no merit to respondent's procedural objections, we now consider whether the ODC met
  its burden of proving that respondent committed the misconduct alleged in the formal charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Pursuant to our original jurisdiction in bar disciplinary matters, we act as triers of fact and
  conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and
  convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646
  So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall,
  <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in any way by the
  findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error
  standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings. See <span class="cite">In re: Caulfield, 96-1401 (La.
  11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class="cite">In re: Pardue, 93-2865
  (La. 3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having reviewed the voluminous record of these proceedings, we find no error in the hearing
  committee's factual findings that respondent knowingly engaged in a scheme whereby he improperly solicited clients
  through paid runners and fostered the unauthorized practice of law by non-lawyers. The ODC presented testimony from
  key participants in the runner-based solicitation scheme. Without exception, these witnesses testified that
  respondent had a central role in the scheme. The hearing committee, which had the benefit of actually seeing and
  hearing these witnesses, found their testimony to be credible. Nothing in the record suggests that we should
  disregard that finding. See <span class="cite">In re: Bolton, 02-0257 (La. 6/21/02),
  <a href="2002-06-25_2002-0257.htm">820 So. 2d 548</a></span> ("Although this court is the trier of fact in bar
  disciplinary cases, we are not prepared to disregard the credibility evaluations made by those committee members who
  were present during respondent's testimony and who act as the eyes and ears of this court."). The factual findings of
  the hearing committee support the conclusion that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged in
  the amended formal charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional misconduct, the next issue presented for our consideration is the
  appropriate sanction to be imposed. In considering that issue, we are mindful that the purpose of lawyer disciplinary
  proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to maintain appropriate standards of professional
  conduct to safeguard the public, to preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from
  engaging in violations of the standards of the profession. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Guidry,
  <a href="1990-12-03_1988-0829.htm">571 So. 2d 161</a> (La. 1990)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances.  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This court has long condemned the practice of soliciting clients for pay. In
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Beard, <a href="1979-09-04_60462.htm">374 So. 2d 1179</a>, 1181 (La.
  1979)</span>, we explained that solicitation of clients for pay cannot be condoned as "the professional character of
  the practice of law could not survive the hunting down and marketing of personal injury claims." In
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. St. Romain, <a href="1990-04-30_1989-0252.htm">560 So. 2d 820</a>
  (La. 1990)</span>, we explained that "[s]olicitation is abhorrent to the legal profession and places lawyers in
  disrepute with the public." See also <span class="cite">In re: D'Amico, 94-3005 (La. 2/28/96),
  <a href="1996-02-28_1994-3005.htm">668 So. 2d 730</a></span> (solicitation "undermines the reputation of lawyers
  generally and the public's attitude toward the profession."). The serious nature of this misconduct is further
  reflected in our specific reference to it in the permanent disbarment guidelines set forth in Appendix E to Supreme
  Court Rule XIX. <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 6</span> suggests permanent disbarment may be appropriate when the
  lawyer engages in "[i]nsurance fraud, including but not limited to staged accidents or widespread runner-based
  solicitation." We have not hesitated to permanently disbar lawyers who knowingly participate in such activities. See

  <p class="Bodycopy">Unquestionably, respondent was at the epicenter of one of the largest runner-based solicitation
  schemes in Louisiana. Although respondent may not have originated the scheme, it is clear that it could not have
  existed without his funding and cooperation. Respondent's attempts to insulate himself from culpability though the
  formation of sham law corporations serves only to aggravate the seriousness of his actions. Rather than using his
  experience as a senior member of the bar to foster the highest ideals of professionalism in the younger attorneys
  working under him, respondent used these attorneys as pawns in his scheme. In addition to the harm to the countless
  clients who were unknowingly drawn into his solicitation scheme, respondent's activities caused grave harm to the
  entire legal profession in Louisiana.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">It is particularly disturbing that in 1989, in connection with his application for readmission to
  the bar, respondent represented to us that he had reformed following his 1983 conviction and that he possessed the
  moral fitness to return to the practice of law. It is now painfully obvious to this court that those representations
  were hollow. Instead of learning from his prior discipline, respondent almost immediately began engaging in the
  improper activities which culminated in his second criminal conviction and the runner-based solicitation charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In summary, this record demonstrates beyond any doubt whatsoever that respondent lacks the good
  moral character and fitness to practice law in Louisiana. In the face of the indisputable evidence of such a
  fundamental lack of moral fitness, we can conceive of no circumstance under which we would ever grant readmission to
  respondent. Accordingly, we find respondent must be permanently disbarred for his felony conviction. Additionally, we
  find that his activities in the runner-based solicitation matter form a separate and independent ground for which he
  must also be permanently disbarred.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is ordered that the name of Michael H. O'Keefe, Louisiana
  Bar Roll number 9951, be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of
  Louisiana be revoked based on his felony conviction as well as his activities in the runner-based solicitation
  matter. Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered that respondent be permanently prohibited
  from being readmitted to the practice of law in this state. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against
  respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the
  date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
