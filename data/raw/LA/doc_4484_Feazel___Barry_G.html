<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: BARRY G. FEAZEL</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<h2>PER CURIAM<a href="#fn_">*</a></h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from six counts of formal charges filed by the 
Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Barry G. Feazel. This 
court previously suspended respondent from the practice of law for a period of 
one year and one day. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Feazel</i>, 98-2060 (La. 10/9/98), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:718%20So.2d%20969 --#">718 So. 2d 969</a></span> (“<i>Feazel 
I</i>”).<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> Although more than two years have passed since respondent was eligible to 
apply for reinstatement from the suspension imposed in <i>Feazel I</i>, he has not 
sought reinstatement and therefore remains suspended.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<h3>The Randolph Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In October 1997, Phillip Randolph paid $1,300 to respondent to handle his 
divorce. Respondent represented to his client that he had filed the divorce, but 
in fact, respondent did little or nothing on Mr. Randolph’s behalf and failed to 
communicate with him. Eventually, Mr. Randolph’s former wife filed for divorce. 
In addition, Mr. Randolph asked respondent to handle the collection of an NSF 
check. Respondent failed to pursue the collection matter and failed to return 
the original NSF check to his client.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On October 23, 1998, respondent’s suspension in <i>Feazel I</i> became final. 
Respondent failed to inform Mr. Randolph of the suspension, failed to return his 
client’s file, and failed to account for or return the unearned portion of the 
fee Mr. Randolph paid.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Randolph filed a complaint with the ODC concerning respondent’s conduct. 
Respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in the investigation of the 
complaint. In particular, respondent failed to comply with the ODC’s requests 
for supplemental information.</p>
<h3>The Saucedo Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">On October 26, 1998, three days after respondent’s suspension in 
<i>Feazel I</i> become 
final, respondent accepted $900 from Kimberly Saucedo to handle an immigration 
matter for Mrs. Saucedo and her husband. Respondent represented to his clients 
that he was pursuing the matter, but in fact, respondent did little or nothing 
on his clients’ behalf and failed to communicate with them. Respondent failed to 
inform his clients of his suspension and failed to account for or return the 
unearned portion of the fee he was paid. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Mrs. Saucedo filed a complaint with the ODC concerning respondent’s conduct. 
Respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in the investigation of the 
complaint. In particular, respondent failed to comply with the ODC’s requests 
for supplemental information.</p>
<h3>The Samuels Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In May 1998, Barbara Samuels paid respondent $900 to handle a community 
property settlement. Respondent did little or nothing on Ms. Samuels’ behalf and 
failed to communicate with her. Later, respondent failed to inform Ms. Samuels 
that he was suspended from the practice of law. He also failed to return his 
client’s file and failed to account for or return the unearned portion of the 
fee he was paid. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Ms. Samuels filed a complaint with the ODC concerning respondent’s conduct. 
Respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in the investigation of the 
complaint. In particular, respondent failed to comply with the ODC’s requests 
for supplemental information.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Following an investigation, the ODC filed six counts of formal charges 
against respondent, three of which alleged substantive misconduct in the 
Randolph, Saucedo, and Samuels matters and three of which alleged respondent 
failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of this misconduct. The 
ODC alleged violations of Rules <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.1 --#">1.1</a></span> (lack of competence), 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.3 --#">1.3</a></span> (lack of

<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.16 --#">1.16</a></span>(d) (termination of the representation), 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.1 --#">8.1</a></span> (failure to cooperate with the 
ODC in its investigation), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a></span>(a) (violation of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a></span>(b) (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on the 
lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a></span>(c) (engaging in 
conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(d) 
(engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), and 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a></span>(g) 
(failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct, and of Supreme Court <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s26 --#">Rule XIX, § 26</a></span> (notice to clients, 
adverse parties, and counsel following the imposition of discipline). In 
addition, the ODC alleged that respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice 
of law in the Saucedo matter, a violation of Rule <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE5.5 --#">5.5</a></span> of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an answer to the formal charges. He denied any misconduct 
relating to the Randolph representation. With respect to the Saucedo matter, 
respondent stated that he may have been retained after his suspension was 
effective, but before he received notice of the court’s action. He contended 
that he prepared the Saucedos’ pleadings and mailed them to the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, although he admitted that there was some question 
whether the pleadings were received and processed by the INS. Because the 
clients “did not get what they paid for,” respondent agreed to return the fee 
the Saucedos paid. In the Samuels matter, respondent essentially admitted the 
misconduct charged in the formal charges. He also stated that he had agreed to 
return to Ms. Samuels her file and the fee she paid. Finally, respondent denied 
that he intentionally failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of 
the complaints filed against him.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-068.HC --#">Hearing Committee Recommendation
</a> </h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Shortly before the hearing scheduled in this matter, respondent and the ODC 
entered into a stipulation in which respondent acknowledged that the factual 
allegations set forth in the formal charges are true, with the exception of 
Count I pertaining to the Randolph matter. With respect to that count, 
respondent agreed that he failed to deposit disputed fees into a client trust 
account, in violation of Rules 1.5 and 1.15 (safekeeping property of clients or 
third persons) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The hearing committee 
accepted the stipulation of the parties, then permitted respondent to testify in 
mitigation.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent explained that his disciplinary problems began in 1996 when his 
solo practice collapsed. In the spring of that year, the attorneys with whom 
respondent had shared office space and a support staff moved to another 
location. Respondent’s wife, who had worked as his secretary, went to work with 
them. Respondent testified that he worked “very, very inefficiently” on his own, 
because he no longer had a staff to do the typing, the filing, and record 
keeping. As a result, respondent’s income suffered. His marriage ended in 
divorce shortly thereafter, and he became depressed. After closing his law 
practice, respondent taught school and cut grass to earn a living. At the time 
of the hearing, respondent was receiving unemployment compensation and was 
looking for work. Respondent further explained that he wanted to make 
restitution to his clients and had set aside some money to do so, but that he 
does not yet have the full amount Mr. Randolph, Mrs. Saucedo, and Ms. Samuels 
are due. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, as well as the stipulation of 
the parties, the hearing committee concluded that respondent violated the 
professional rules as charged.<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> In particular, the committee found that 
respondent exhibited a pattern of neglecting his clients’ legal matters and 
failing to communicate with his clients. The committee also found that 
respondent failed to properly and timely cooperate with the ODC in its 
investigation of the complaints filed against him.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Turning to the issue of an appropriate sanction, the committee suggested that 
the baseline sanction for respondent’s misconduct ranges from suspension to 
disbarment. As mitigating factors, the committee found respondent had personal 
and emotional problems at the time of the misconduct and displayed remorse for 
his actions. As aggravating factors, the committee recognized respondent’s prior 
disciplinary offenses, a pattern of misconduct, and substantial experience in 
the practice of law (admitted 1978). Considering all the evidence, the committee 
recommended that respondent be suspended from practice for three years.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the hearing committee’s 
recommendation.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-068.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The board found that respondent violated duties owed to his clients and to 
the profession, and that his conduct was knowing rather than intentional. The 
board suggested that the potential for serious injury is always present whenever 
an attorney neglects a legal matter, fails to safeguard client property, and 
fails to communicate fully with a client. In the instant matter, respondent’s 
clients experienced significant delays in the resolution of their legal matters, 
have been deprived of their money for an extended period of time, and were 
forced to obtain new legal counsel to resolve their cases. Moreover, the legal 
profession was harmed by respondent’s initial failure to cooperate in the 
disciplinary investigation of the complaints filed against him.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering the ABA’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> and the prior 
jurisprudence,<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> the board found the baseline sanction for respondent’s 
misconduct is a suspension from the practice of law. Given his prior 
disciplinary record, the board suggested that a lengthy suspension is 
appropriate. However, the board recognized that respondent’s current and prior 
misconduct arose at the same time as his divorce and the breakdown of his 
“support system” for his solo practice. Concluding that neither respondent nor 
the public would be well served by a flat three-year suspension, the board 
recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for three 
years, with one year deferred, followed by one year of supervised probation with 
conditions, including his attendance at Ethics School. The board further 
recommended that respondent be required to pay restitution to his clients and be 
assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest 
to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of the court’s 
judgment until paid.<br>
Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board’s 
recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record supports a finding that respondent neglected his clients’ legal 
matters, failed to communicate with his clients, failed to account for or refund 
unearned fees, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation.<a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> 
Therefore, the sole issue presented for our consideration is the appropriate 
sanction for this misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary 
proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the 
public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. 
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to 
be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the 
offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 
1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent’s conduct harmed his clients by delaying resolution of their legal 
matters and depriving them of their funds. Under similar facts, this court has 
imposed lengthy suspensions. See, e.g., <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Powers</i>, 99-2069 (La. 9/24/99), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:744%20So.2d%201275 --#">744 So. 2d 1275</a></span> (three-year suspension imposed on attorney with a prior 
disciplinary record for similar misconduct who neglected three clients’ legal 
matters, failed to communicate with the clients, failed to account for and 
return unearned fees, and failed to cooperate with the ODC). Aggravating factors 
are present, such as a pattern of misconduct, respondent’s substantial 
experience in the practice of law, and his prior disciplinary record.<a class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a> However, 
we also recognize the presence of mitigating factors, including respondent’s 
personal and emotional problems at the time of the misconduct, his remorse for 
his actions, and his belated cooperation with the ODC, as demonstrated by his 
stipulation acknowledging most of the charges against him.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will adopt the disciplinary board’s recommendation and 
suspend respondent from the practice of law for three years, with one year 
deferred, followed by a one-year period of supervised probation subject to the 
conditions set forth by the disciplinary board.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and 
disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that Barry G. 
Feazel be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of three 
years, with one year deferred, followed by a one-year period of supervised 
probation subject to the conditions set forth by the disciplinary board. 
Respondent is ordered to make restitution of any unearned portion of the fees 
paid by his clients. Payment of restitution or good faith efforts at restitution 
may be considered in the event respondent seeks reinstatement to the practice of 
law. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in 
accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence 
thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s judgment until paid.</p>
<hr noshade="" color="#000000" align="left" width="100" size="1">
<p class="footnotetext">&nbsp;<a name="fn_">*</a> Retired Judge Robert L. Lobrano, assigned as 
Justice Pro Tempore, participating in the decision.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> In <i>Feazel I</i>, respondent was retained to handle his 
client’s divorce. Respondent represented to his client that he had filed the 
divorce, but in fact, he had not. He then failed to return the unearned legal 
fee for more than a year.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> Notably, the hearing committee did not find that 
respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. The committee found that 
while respondent accepted the Saucedo representation after he was suspended by 
this court, “the evidence indicates that the notice was not mailed to Mr. Feazel 
by the Supreme Court until November 12, 1998.” The committee is mistaken, 
however. Respondent was suspended on October 9, 1998, and the judgment became 
final fourteen days later. The notice mailed by this court on November 12, 1998 
was simply the dissemination of the court’s ruling to all courts in this state, 
as required by Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 17(C).</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> Standard 4.42 suggests that suspension is generally 
appropriate when a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for a client or 
engages in a pattern of neglect and causes injury or potential injury to a 
client. Under Standard 4.41, disbarment is appropriate for such misconduct when 
the injury or potential injury is serious. Standard 7.2 suggests that suspension 
is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a 
violation of a duty owed to the profession, and causes injury or potential 
injury to a client, the public, or the legal system. Under Standard 7.1, 
disbarment is appropriate for such misconduct when the lawyer intends to obtain 
a benefit for himself. The board found the facts of this case do not support 
application of the disbarment standards.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> In <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Bivins</i>, 98-2513 (La. 12/11/98), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:724%20So.2d%20198 --#">724 So. 2d 198</a></span>, 
this court suspended the attorney for one year and one day, followed by an 
eighteen-month period of probation, based on misconduct similar to that at issue 
in the instant case. </p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">5</a> Concerning the unauthorized practice of law issue, the 
record does not reflect when respondent received notice of his suspension in 
<i>Feazel I</i>. However, we assume it would have been shortly after the opinion was 
rendered on October 9, 1998. Respondent did not apply for a rehearing from the 
court’s ruling, and accordingly, the judgment became final on October 23, 1998. 
Three days later, respondent accepted a $900 check from Mrs. Saucedo. He 
subsequently discontinued any activities which constituted the practice of law. 
Thus, it appears that respondent did not knowingly violate the prohibition 
against practicing law after he was suspended and that any violation of Rule 5.5 
of the Rules of Professional Conduct was strictly technical in nature.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn6">6</a> We decline to consider <i>Feazel I</i> as prior discipline, 
because most of respondent’s misconduct in this case occurred prior to the 
rendition of that opinion. Nonetheless, we recognize, as we did in <i>Feazel I</i>, 
that respondent was reprimanded in 1986 for charging an excessive fee and in 
1987 for commingling funds.<br>
