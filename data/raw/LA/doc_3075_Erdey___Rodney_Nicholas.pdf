  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE:  RODNEY NICHOLAS ERDEY</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 03-DB-006</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE LOUISIANA ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a petition for consent discipline by
  Rodney Nicholas Erdey ("Respondent") of Denham Springs, Louisiana, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State
  of Louisiana. The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") has concurred in the petition. No formal charges have been
  filed in this matter. For reasons stated below, the Disciplinary Board accepts the petition and orders that a public
  reprimand be issued against Respondent.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On January 29, 2003, prior to the institution of formal charges, Respondent filed a petition for
  consent discipline, stipulation of facts, affidavit of consent, and a waiver of opportunity to withdraw consent.  In
  the petition, Respondent suggests that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction for his violation of Rule
  <span class="Rules">1.15(b)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> On the same day, ODC filed its concurrence in the consent discipline and memorandum in support
  of the proposed sanction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A panel of the Board reviewed this matter on April 24, 2003. The parties waived appearances,
  therefore, oral argument was not held.</p>

  <h3> STIPULATION OF FACTS<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" class="fn" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></h3>

  <p>The stipulation of facts filed in this matter provides the following information relevant to Respondent's
  misconduct:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div id="fc03-DB-006">
      <p>*****</p>

      <h4>I.</h4>

      <p>Mr. Rodney Nicholas Erdey whose bar number is 20540 was admitted to practice law on April 15<sup>th</sup>,
      1991. During the time period of this complaint, Mr. Erdey worked as a sole practitioner.</p>

      <h4>II.</h4>

      <p>Mr. Erdey has no prior attorney discipline and is eligible to practice law in the State of Louisiana.</p>

      <h4>III.</h4>

      <p>The Office of Disciplinary Counsel received a complaint from Ms. Sondra Renee Thompson in June of 2002
      alleging violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct by Mr. Erdey. Ms. Thompson retained Mr. Erdey to
      represent her after a neighbor's dog bit her daughter. The complainant has alleged that the settlement was
      supposed to cover all medical bills, but that some of them were not paid. The case went to trial and a judgment
      was obtained. The award was for $35,000 plus special damages of $9330.43 less $1000.00 that had already been
      provided Ms. Thompson. After trial, the defendants offered a reduced amount[,] $38,500[,] with the condition that
      they would not seek appellate review. The defendants would also get credit for the $1000 already paid. After
      discussing the matter, Ms. Thompson accepted the settlement. The parties disagree as to what was explained about
      the settlement. Funds were obtained and disbursed to the client. Although they perfected a lien, Our Lady of the
      Lake [Regional Medical Center] was not paid at the time that funds were disbursed to the client.</p>

      <p>According to the [r]espondent, there was confusion as to the exact balance of medical bills to be paid. In
      fact, the [r]espondent prepared two settlement accountings. The first settlement accounting included Our Lady of
      the Lake, the second one omitted them. At issue was whether Our Lady of the Lake's costs [were] included in Subro
      Audit's billing. According to Mr. Erdey, he was to confirm if money was owed and get a reduction, if necessary.
      Instead of waiting for the issued to be resolved, the clients were given all the remaining funds and they signed
      a settlement statement indicating they would be responsible for any outstanding bills. After further
      investigation, Mr. Erdey discovered additional monies owed and let his clients know that they were responsible
      for paying the money. After finding out that the money needed to be paid, the Thompsons filed a complaint. The
      [r]espondent's actions in the case violated Rule <span class="allegedrules">1.15(b)</span> of the Rules of
      Professional Conduct.</p>

      <h4>IV.</h4>

      <p>In mitigation, Mr. Erdey submits that any violation of the Rules of Professional conduct [were] unintentional
      and that he has taken steps to ensure that Our Lady of the Lake has been paid.</p>

  <h2><b>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rule 1.15(b) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.  The Board must accept that Respondent has violated this rule.  <span class="CITE"><i>In re
  Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96); <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given the
  rule violation, the Board is left to determine if the proposed sanction of public reprimand is appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX §10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a finding of
  lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) Whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2) Whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) The amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) The existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board finds that Respondent violated duties owed to the legal profession.  Respondent asserts
  that his violation was unintentional. Based upon the definitions provided in the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing
  Lawyer Sanctions</i>, Respondent's actions were negligent.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Actual injury occurred here in that Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center was deprived
  of funds it was owed.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon a review of the documents filed in this matter, the Board finds that there are no
  aggravating factors present in this matter.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" class="fn" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> The
  Board finds that the following mitigating factors are present: <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior
  disciplinary record</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest or selfish motive</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">timely good faith effort to make restitution or to rectify consequences of the
  misconduct</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board and cooperative
  attitude toward the proceedings</span>.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" class="fn" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>

  <h2>DETERMINATION OF BASELINE SANCTION</h2>

  <h3>I.          ABA Standards</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's Standards to determine the baseline sanction by
  "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's mental state and the extent of the injury caused; and then adjust the
  sanction in accordance with the aggravating and mitigating factors present."  <i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La.
  11/30/94); 646 So. 2d 343, 350.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The proposed sanction is in line with the ABA guidelines.  Under A.B.A. Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">7.3</span>, a "[r]eprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer negligently engages in
  conduct that is a violation of a duty owed to the profession, and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the
  public, or the legal system." The commentary to this standard states that:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Reprimand is the appropriate sanction in most cases of a violation of a duty owed to the
  profession. Usually there is little or no injury to a client, the public, or the legal system, and the purposes of
  lawyer discipline will be best served by imposing a public sanction that helps educate the respondent lawyer and
  deter future violations. A public sanction also informs both the public and other members of the profession that this
  behavior is improper.</p>

  <h3>II.        Relevant Case Law</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board also looks to relevant case law for assistance in determining an appropriate sanction
  for violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The following cases offer guidance: <span class="CITE"><i>In re
  McIntire</i>, 2002-0587 (La. 6/6/2002), <a href="../SC/2002-06-06_2002-0587.htm">819 So. 2d 305</a>, <i>aff'g</i>
  <a href="2002-02-01_00-DB-066.htm">00-DB-066</a> (La.Atty.Discp.Bd. 2/1/2002)</span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re
  Jones</i>, <a href="1999-04-21_99-DB-002.htm">99-DB-002</a> (La.Atty.Discp.Bd. 4/13/99)</span>; and
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Mann</i>, <a href="1999-03-08_98-DB-091.htm">98-DB-091</a> (La.Atty.Discp.Bd.
  3/8/99)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <i>McIntire</i>, <i>supra</i>, despite issuing a letter of guarantee to a chiropractor who had
  provided care to the attorney's client, the attorney failed to make full payment to the chiropractor. After
  conducting a formal hearing, the hearing committee determined that McIntire did not violate Rule 1.15(b) as charged.
  However, upon review, the Board concluded that the committee had erred in finding no violation and ordered that a
  public reprimand be issued against the attorney. <i>Id.</i> at 4-5. As mitigating factors, the Board recognized that
  McIntire's actions were negligent and that he had no prior disciplinary record. Substantial experience in the
  practice of law was the only aggravating factor found by the Board. <i>Id.</i> at 3.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <i>Jones</i>, <i>supra</i>, the attorney failed to deliver all the funds claimed by a medical
  provider, despite executing a letter of guarantee in favor of the provider. The doctor's bill totaled $6,023.75, and
  the attorney paid only $1,000. The remainder of the settlement funds was disbursed to the client. <i>Id.</i> at
  1.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Jones and ODC filed a joint petition for consent discipline prior to the filing of formal
  charges. A public reprimand was the proposed sanction. The Board found that Jones engaged in negligent misconduct and
  identified several mitigating factors, including a cooperative attitude, no dishonest or selfish motive, good faith
  efforts at restitution, and no prior discipline. The Board agreed that a reprimand was appropriate for this single
  act of misconduct. <i>Id.</i> at 2-3.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <i>Mann</i>, <i>supra</i>, two complaints were filed against the attorney. The first alleged
  his failure to notify and deliver funds claimed by the medical provider, despite his executing a letter of guarantee
  in favor of the provider. Apparently, Mann gave all of the settlement funds to the client. Several months later, the
  provider was paid. This conduct was found to have violated Rule 1.15(b). <i>Id.</i> at 1.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the second complaint, Mann failed to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client
  and failed to supervise his employees, resulting in prescription of a claim. The client then engaged other counsel,
  and a malpractice action was filed. <i>Id.</i> at 2.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mann and ODC filed a joint petition for consent discipline, in which Mann admitted his misconduct
  and requested that a public reprimand be issued. The Board found that Mann engaged in negligent, rather than
  intentional misconduct, that he cooperated with the proceedings, and that he had no dishonest or selfish motive.
  Despite a prior admonition and substantial experience in the practice of law, the Board found the proposed discipline
  was appropriate. <i>Id.</i> at 2-3.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the petition for consent discipline be accepted, and
  that a public reprimand be issued against the respondent, Rodney Nicholas Erdey. It is further ordered that
  Respondent be assessed the costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty
  days from the date of finality of this Ruling until paid.</p>

    interest shall be one of which the lawyer has actual knowledge, and shall be limited to a statutory lien or
    privilege, a final judgment addressing disposition of those funds or property, or a written agreement by the client
    or the lawyer on behalf of the client guaranteeing payment out of those funds or property. Except as stated in this
    rule or otherwise permitted by law or by agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client
    or third person any funds or other property that the client or third person is entitled to receive and, upon
    request by the client or third person, shall promptly render a full accounting regarding such property.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" class="fn" id="_ftn2">[2]</a> ODC did not sign the
  stipulation of facts nor did it concur in the stipulated facts in its concurrence to the proposed discipline.
  Respondent did not include a certificate of service on his petition for consent discipline or his stipulation of
  facts. Based upon documents in the file, ODC was aware of Respondent's filings. Since ODC has not objected to the
  stipulation of facts, as filed by Respondent, the Board has proceeded in reviewing this matter.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" class="fn" id="_ftn3">[3]</a> According to the ABA
  Standards, negligence is "the failure of a lawyer to heed a substantial risk that circumstances exist or that a
  result will follow, which failure is a deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable lawyer would exercise in
  the situation." Knowledge is defined as "the conscious awareness of the nature or attendant circumstances of the
  conduct but without the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result." Intent is defined as "the
  conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result."</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">Although I concur in the result reached by the majority, I dissent in part.  The Board
    correctly recognizes a violation of Rule 1.15(b) inasmuch as the respondent has entered an admission and affidavit
    of consent.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">What troubles me is the fact that the Rules of Professional Conduct are used to impose an
    ethical violation for simple negligence.  In this case there seems to be confusion as to the exact balance of
    medical bills to be reimbursed to a health care provider who had perfected a lien.  The majority, in its opinion,
    concludes that the respondent's actions were negligent and finds that there were no aggravating factors present in
    the respondent's conduct. Especially as it relates to sole practitioners, the automatic equating of simple
    negligence to ethical misconduct must be addressed.  In this case the respondent, who has an unblemished ethical
    record, will be given a public reprimand in a situation in which there was no intention whatsoever to act in an
    unethical fashion.  For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>
