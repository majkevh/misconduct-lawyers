No. 95-B-0983.<br>
IN RE: Jami I. MITCHELL.<br>
<br>
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>PER CURIAM</p>
<p>*************************************************************************************</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On August 1, 1994, pursuant to a guilty plea in the U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas, San Antonio Division, Jami I. Mitchell was convicted of one count of possession with the intent to distribute marijuana, a felony, in violation of <span class="CITE">21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1).</span>&nbsp; On September 30, 1994, Respondent was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment, to be followed by three years' supervised release.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On January 11, 1995, formal charges were filed, alleging that Respondent violated <span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a>(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct when he committed a criminal act.&nbsp; The charges also allege that said crime adversely affects Respondent's moral fitness to practice law under<a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s19'></a>Respondent's role in the drug transaction was to transport 85.37 pounds of marijuana from San Antonio, Texas to New Orleans, Louisiana for a fee.&nbsp; The following mitigating factors were presented <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Ad28a?an=JD_HC9502 --##'>at the hearing</a>:&nbsp; no prior record, cooperation with the disciplinary system in agreeing to an interim suspension, one which the court was going to order, prior good character, and imposition of the criminal sanction.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Hearing Committee found that Respondent's acts were intentional, and recommended that Respondent be disbarred.&nbsp; The Disciplinary Board agreed with the facts and recommendations of the Hearing Committee, having concluded that disbarment is the appropriate baseline sanction for a criminal conviction involving a lawyer's participation in the business of distributing illegal drugs.<p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the record and the recommendations of the<a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Ad28a?an=JD_HC9502 --##'> Hearing Committee </a>and <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A821a?an=JD_95-DB-002 --##'>Disciplinary Board</a>, it is the decision of the court that the Disciplinary Board's recommendation be adopted.<br>
 it is ordered that Jami I. Mitchell be disbarred, and that his name be stricken from the rolls of attorneys licensed to practice.<br>
DISBARRED.</p>
