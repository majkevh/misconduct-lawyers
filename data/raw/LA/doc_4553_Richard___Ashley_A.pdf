  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 01-B-3409</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: ASHLEY A. RICHARD</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from one count of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Ashley A. Richard, an attorney formerly licensed to practice law in
  Louisiana, but currently disbarred.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In November, 1998, Nolan Michel retained respondent for $125 in connection with a donation
  matter. At the time respondent accepted the representation, he was ineligible to practice law because he has failed
  to pay his bar dues or satisfy his mandatory continuing legal education requirements since 1994.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, Mr. Michel learned respondent had been ineligible to practice law at the time the
  donation was effectuated. Accordingly, Mr. Michel filed a complaint with the ODC. In connection with the ODC's
  investigation, respondent admitted that at the time he assumed the representation of Mr. Michel, he was aware he was
  ineligible to practice law.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed one count of formal charges. The charges alleged respondent's
  actions violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">5.5(a)</span> (violating a disciplinary regulation of another jurisdiction through
  unauthorized practice of law in that jurisdiction), <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate
  with the ODC in its investigation), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving deceit,
  dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial
  to the administration of justice) and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the
  ODC).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent failed to file an answer to the complaint. Accordingly, the matter was submitted to
  the hearing committee on documentary evidence only.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/1999-11-02_99-DB-039.htm">Recommendation of the Hearing
  Committee</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee determined the ODC proved the formal charges by clear and convincing
  evidence. It found that respondent knowingly and intentionally accepted representation while he was ineligible to
  practice law. The committee recognized respondent, after receiving notice of his ineligibility, took no measures to
  be reinstated as a licensed attorney in good standing. Considering these factors, the committee recommended
  respondent be disbarred from the practice of law.</p>

  <h3><a href="../DB/2000-05-19_99-DB-039.htm">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board adopted the findings of the hearing committee in all respects. The board
  determined respondent intentionally violated duties owed to his client, the legal system and the profession. It
  pointed out that Mr. Michel's legal matter was delayed approximately eight months because of respondent's misconduct.
  Further, it noted respondent caused injury to the profession and the legal system when he practiced law while
  ineligible.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Relying on Standards <span class="ABAstandard">7.1</span> and
  <span class="ABAstandard">8.1</span> of the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions,<a name="fnref1" class="fn"
  href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a> the board found the baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct was disbarment. As
  aggravating factors, the board recognized respondent had a prior disciplinary history, observing that during the
  pendency of the instant proceedings, he had been disbarred by this court for unrelated conduct. <span class="cite">In
  re: Richard, 00-1418 (La. 8/31/00), <a href="2000-09-01_2000-1418.htm">767 So. 2d 36</a></span> ("Richard I"). The
  board also found the aggravating factors of <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith obstruction of the
  disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency</span> and
  <span class="ABAstandard">refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the misconduct</span>. The board identified
  no mitigating factors. Accordingly, the board recommended respondent be disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the recommendation of the
  disciplinary board.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94 1316
  (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in
  any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the
  manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings. See <span class="cite">In re: Caulfield,
  96 1401 (La. 11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class="cite">In re:
  Pardue, 93 2865 (La. 3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on our independent review, we conclude the findings of the hearing committee are supported
  by the record. The undisputed evidence demonstrates that respondent knowingly and intentionally engaged in the
  practice of law while he was ineligible to do so under the rules of this court.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional violations, we now turn to a determination of the appropriate sanction
  for this misconduct. The purpose of disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to
  maintain the appropriate standards of professional conduct, to preserve the integrity of the legal profession and to
  deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the standards of the profession. <span class="CITE"><i>In re:
  Vaughan</i>, 00 1892 (La. 10/27/00), <a href="2000-10-27_2000-1892.htm">772 So. 2d 87</a></span>;
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Lain</i>, 00 0148 (La. 5/26/00), <a href="2000-05-26_2000-0148.htm">760 So. 2d
  1152</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Levy</i>, <a href="1981-07-02_60464.htm">400 So.
  2d 1355</a> (La. 1981)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness
  of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Redd</i>, 95 1472 (La. 9/15/95), <a href="1995-09-15_1995-1472.htm">660 So. 2d
  839</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In reviewing the misconduct, we find that it occurred within the same general time frame as the
  misconduct at issue in <i>Richard I</i>. In <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain</i>,
  <a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 So. 2d 470</a> (La. 1991)</span>, we observed that when a second attorney
  disciplinary proceeding involves conduct which occurred during the same time period as the first proceeding, the
  overall discipline to be imposed should be determined as if both proceedings were before the court simultaneously. In
  that case, involving an attorney who was already disbarred, we declined to disbar the respondent again or extend the
  minimum period for readmission. Rather, we adjudged the attorney guilty of additional misconduct which could be
  considered in the event the attorney sought readmission. See also <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Gros</i>,
  <a href="2002-03-15_1998-0772.htm">98-0772</a> (La. 3/15/02), ___ So. 2d___</span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re:
  Parker</i>, <a href="2002-03-15_2001-3532.htm">00-3532</a> (La. 3/15/02), ___ So. 2d ___</span>;
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Patrick</i>, <a href="2002-03-15_2001-1419.htm">01-1419</a> (La. 3/15/02), ___ So. 2d
  ___</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In imposing a sanction in the instant case, we believe the approach of Chatelain is instructive.
  Accordingly, our determination of a sanction will be based upon the appropriate sanction we would have imposed if
  these charges had been before the court at the same time as the charges in respondent's previous disciplinary
  proceeding.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's decision to knowingly and intentionally engage in the practice of law while
  ineligible to do so is a serious affront to the authority of this court. See <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Jones</i>,
  99-1036 (La. 10/19/99), <a href="1999-10-19_1999-1036.htm">747 So. 2d 1081</a></span> (attorney disbarred for
  practicing law while ineligible). Had the instant charges been filed simultaneously with those charges forming the
  basis of <i>Richard I</i>, which also involved practice of law while ineligible, they would have only reinforced our
  view that respondent must be disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Therefore, as in Chatelain, we will adjudge respondent guilty of additional violations which
  warrant disbarment and which will be added to his record for consideration in the event he applies for readmission
  after becoming eligible to do so. We further emphasize that although respondent may have a procedural right to apply
  for readmission, this court retains absolute discretion to grant or deny such an application. In light of
  respondent's prior disciplinary history, this court will carefully scrutinize any application for readmission with a
  critical eye.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the
  record, it is ordered that respondent is adjudged guilty of additional violations which warrant disbarment and may be
  considered in the event that he applies for readmission from his disbarment in <i>In re: Richard</i>, 00-1418 (La.
  8/31/00), <a href="2000-09-01_2000-1418.htm">767 So. 2d 36</a>, after becoming eligible to do so. All costs and
  expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal
  interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"> <a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> Standard 7.1 provides disbarment is
  generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional
  with the intent to obtain benefit for the lawyer or another, and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a
  client, the public, or the legal system; Standard 8.1 provides disbarment is generally appropriate when a lawyer: (a)
  intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or
  potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession; or (b) has been suspended for the same
  or similar misconduct, and intentionally or knowingly engages in further acts of misconduct that causes injury or
  potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession.</p>
