IN RE: BURTON GUIDRY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDING</p>
<p><font size="3" color="#0000AA">HALL, Justice</font></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After receiving a complaint in 1986, the Committee n Professional Responsibility (the Committee) of the Louisiana State Bar Association investigated a specification of misconduct on the part of attorney Burton Guidry concerning Guidry's representation of two nursing homes in 1982.&nbsp; The alleged misconduct involves commingling and conversion of a client's funds and the neglect of a legal matter entrusted to the attorney.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Committee held a formal investigative hearing on May 1, 1987.&nbsp; The Committee, by unanimous vote, found that Guidry had violated the laws of professional conduct of lawyers and that these violations were of sufficient gravity to evidence a lack of moral fitness for the practice of law.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">On April 6, 1988, the Committee filed a petition for disciplinary action.&nbsp; Guidry timely filed an answer to &quot;lie petition, and a Commissioner was appointed on September 22, 1988.&nbsp; Guidry represented himself at the Commissioner's hearing on November 4, 1988.&nbsp; The Commissioner filed his report with the court, but subsequently Guidry retained counsel and requested a second Commissioner's hearing.&nbsp; This motion was granted, and the Commissioner held a hearing on October 25, 1989.&nbsp; The Commissioner filed a supplemental report with the court, and this matter proceeded to oral argument on October 22, 1990.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The misconduct alleged is that Guidry's handling of the two cases in question constituted a violation of </font></span>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=DR6-101'></a>(A)(3), and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=DR9-102'></a>(A)(B) <font size="3">of the Code of Professional Responsibility of the Louisiana State Bar Association The Bar Association has </font><font size="2">burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that Guidry was guilty of the alleged specifications of misconduct.&nbsp; </font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">Louisiana State Bar Association v. Dowd, 445 So.2d 723 (La. 1984).</font></span></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman'>The facts in this matter are not really in dispute. the evidence taken at the hearings established - that&nbsp; Guidry, Practicing as a member of the law firm of Edwards &amp; Guidry, was employed in 1982 by his friend, David Guillot, owner of Gonzales Health Care (Gonzales), and part owner of Amite Nursing Home (Amite), to represent him in defense of suits brought against the operators of the nursing homes by American Mutual Insurance Company of Boston.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman'>Guidry contacted the counsel for the plaintiff and offered to settle the two cases.&nbsp; Apparently, there was a misunderstanding concerning this settlement discussion. </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> Nevertheless, Guidry, believing that his proposal had been accepted, notified Mr. Guillot, who sent him checks from each entity ($1,635.50 from Gonzales, and $1,500.00 from Amite).&nbsp; These checks were deposited by Guidry into his firm's general account, which was overdrawn at the time.&nbsp; No settlement payment was made from these funds in either case, and the account was subsequently depleted by paying firm obligations when the law firm was dissolved in late 1982.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Gonzales case was continued and rescheduled a number of times with notice given to Guidry each time.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Guidry failed to take any steps to protect his client, and a judgment was rendered against Mr. Guillot.&nbsp; Mr. Guillot subsequently had the judgment cancelled by remitting $5,316.00 to American Mutual Insurance Company.&nbsp; Mr. Guillot hired other counsel to represent him in the Amite matter, and that case was subsequently settled for $4,500.00.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">The</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="2"> findings of the Commissioner were that Guidry's negligence resulted in a commingling of his client's funds with those of his law firm, and a conversion of those funds for his benefit.&nbsp; He also neglected the legal matter entrusted to him by allowing a default judgment to be entered against his client.&nbsp; Guidry's actions were clearly violations of </font>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=DR6-101'></a>(A)(3), and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=DR9-102'></a>(A)(B)<font face='Times New Roman' size="2"> of the Code of Professional Responsibility.&nbsp; These findings are not contested by Guidry.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The recommendation of the Commissioner after his first hearing was that Guidry be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months.&nbsp; As previously noted, Guidry then retained counsel to represent him in this matter and was granted a reopening of the Commissioner's hearing.&nbsp; At this second hearing, it was revealed that Guidry had been suffering from clinical depression and a resulting mixed substance abuse (food and marijuana) stemming from events which occurred during the same time period as the misconduct involved in this matter.&nbsp; These events were the traumatic divorce from his first wife and the breakup of his law partnership with Stephen Edwards.&nbsp; Guidry points to this depression in mitigation of his apparent lack of cooperation with, and belligerent attitude toward, the Committee.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After this second hearing, the Commissioner filed a supplemental report recommending that Guidry be suspended for a period of six months with the further proviso that the period be shortened upon a showing that he has been rehabilitated.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The recommendation of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel is a suspension from the practice of law for two years, with the condition that Guidry must prove that his depression and marijuana use have been treated and removed prior to reinstatement. </font><span class="footnotereference"><font face='Times New Roman' size="1" color="#008000">2</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Guidry argues that he has been sufficiently punished by the public scruinty of these ongoing proceedings since the investigation was begun in April of 1986. He also argues that he has been fully rehabilitated, having been free from substance abuse and in continuing psychiatric treatment since June of 1989. Guidry asserts that he is well and urges this court to fashion a remedy which recognizes his assumption of the responsibility for his acts and his successful efforts at rehabilitation.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">The discipline to be imposed on an attorney for ethical violations will depend on the seriousness of the offense involved and the facts and circumstances of each case..</font></span><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2"> Louisiana State Bar Association -vs White 538 So.256,261 (La.1989.</font></span></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">The choice of sanctions is not governed by strict rules, but rather depends on the degree of misconduct in the individual case. I</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><u>n </u></font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">Louisiana State Bar Association v Hinrchs,&nbsp; 486 So.2d 116 1986),</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> we set forth categories of discipline for commingling and conversion cases. Factors which are to be considered in making this determination include: whether the lawyer acts in bad faith; commits fraud or forgery; makes restitution, and whether such restitution is before or after disciplinary or legal proceedings</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="1"><b>&nbsp; </b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b>the </b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">magnitude and duration. Of the deprivation and the magnitude or risk of damage, expense or inconvenience to the client.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have examined the facts involves in this matter and the various proposals for discipline and are of the</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="1"> ,</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">opinion ,that this case f</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b>its </b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">within the category warranting suspension of a&nbsp; year or less.&nbsp; This category of commingling and conversion cases was recently evaluated </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><u>by- this court </u></font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">Louisiana State Bar Association v Gold, 563 'So.2d 855 (La. 1990).</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">As&nbsp; in Gold, several mitigating factors indicate a suspension of six months rather than a more severe discipline.&nbsp; Guidry's misconduct resulted from negligence on his part rather than from an intentional wrongdoing.&nbsp; He had developed a heavy case load and took on these additional matters which he apparently had neither the time nor the expertise to handle.&nbsp; His ethical violations were caused by his inexperience, carelessness, and neglect.&nbsp; While his actions were serious breaches of his ethical responsibilities, they were not done with the intent to harm or deprive his client.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Guidry has reimbursed Mr. Guillot fully for all of his damages.&nbsp; While part of this reimbursement did not come until after the Committee investigative hearing, it was a full reimbursement, and Guidry has expressed remorse and apologies for his conduct.&nbsp; Additionally, Guidry has not sought to excuse or lighten the seriousness of his misconduct.&nbsp; He had no disciplinary charges prior to the conduct complained of in this case. </font></span><span class="footnotereference"><font face='Times New Roman' size="1" color="#008000">3</font></span></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An additional mitigating factor in this case is the delay in bringing and concluding disciplinary action.&nbsp; This is an ordeal which punishes a respondent over and beyond the discipline imposed by this court.&nbsp; </font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">Louisiana State Bar Association v. Edwards, 387 So.2d 1137, 1139 (La. 1980); Louisiana State Bar Association v. Gold, supra.</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; The offenses involved in this case occurred approximately eight years ago.&nbsp; While some of the delay was caused by Guidry seeking a second Commissioner's hearing, the Committee did not file a petition for </font><span class="BodyText">disciplinary action until approximately six years after the misconduct and about three years after receiving the Initial complaint.&nbsp; As stated in </span><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">Gold and Edwards</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">, this court takes into consideration unreasonable delay in imposing discipline on an attorney who has used the intervening years wisely in rehabilitating himself.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fact that an attorney was suffering from personal or emotional problems at the time of his misconduct is a mitigating factor.&nbsp; In this case, Guidry clearly had emotional problems subsequent to his misconduct.&nbsp; He was experiencing several emotional events at the time of the misconduct, but the record indicates that his clinical depression was not diagnosed until 1986.&nbsp; The fact that he was suffering from clinical depression during the early stages of these proceedings has the effect of excusing, at least to some extent, his belligerent attitude toward, and failure to cooperate with, the Committee in the early stages of these proceedings before he began treatment of his depression.&nbsp; It has the additional effect of raising the issue of whether Guidry is emotionally fit to practice law at this time.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Guidry began treatment for his depression in June of 1989, and declares that he has been free of marijuana use since that time.&nbsp; His treating psychiatrist, Dr. Krishna Yalamanchili, stated that as of October 1990, Guidry was continuing his counseling sessions once a month and seemed to have a good insight into his condition and a willingness to go along with his treatment plan.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Guidry is presently working for the Baton Rouge Public Defender's Office and has a small private practice out of his home.&nbsp; He has apparently done well with the Public Defender's Office and has volunteered for service </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="2">with the State Bar Association's Committee which aids fellow attorneys with substance abuse problems.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Any imposition of discipline must take into consideration the purposes of disciplinary proceedings, that is, to maintain appropriate standards of professional conduct and thus safeguard the public; to preserve the integrity of the legal profession; and to deter other attorneys from engaging in violations of the standards of the profession.&nbsp; </font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">Louisiana State Bar Association v. White,</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> </font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">supra, at 261.</font></span></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taking these purposes and the mitigating factors into consideration, we are of the opinion that a suspension from the practice of law for a period of six months is warranted.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We recognize the harshness of any suspension from practice after such a long period of time has elapsed since the violation, and we are also aware of the possible detrimental effect this could have on the progress of Guidry's rehabilitation.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the severity of the violations warrant a suspension rather than a reprimand or some form of probation.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Guidry's emotional health is of concern to the court and he must be sufficiently rehabilitated before he is allowed to be reinstated to the practice of law.&nbsp; Therefore, as an additional disciplinary measure, in order for him to be-reinstated, Guidry will be required to petition this court for reinstatement at the end of his six-month suspension.&nbsp; At that time, he will be required to show that he has continued his psychiatric treatments and that he has the emotional stability to handle the legal matters of his clients.</font></p>
<p><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the foregoing reasons, respondent Guidry is </font>suspended<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> from the practice of law for </font>six months<font face='Times New Roman' size="3">, effective from the finality of this judgment.&nbsp; It is .further ordered that for Guidry to be reinstated, he must petition the court at the conclusion of his six-month suspension for such reinstatement and make a showing that he has continued his psychiatric treatments and is emotionally fit to practice law.&nbsp; All costs of these proceedings are assessed to respondent.</font></p>
