  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: DONALD R. DOBBINS</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM <a class="fn" href="#fn">*</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This disciplinary proceeding arises from one count of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Donald R. Dobbins, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State
  of Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent represented Mona Ray LeBlanc in a worker's compensation case. Subsequently, he
  negotiated a settlement in the amount of $13,258.48 on behalf of his client. Respondent deposited the settlement
  check into his client trust account, and issued a check to Ms. LeBlanc from the trust account in the amount of
  $10,258.48. Approximately one month later, Ms. LeBlanc deposited respondent's check into her bank account; however,
  it was returned for insufficient funds. As a result, several of her personal checks were dishonored. Ms. LeBlanc
  attempted to contact respondent to resolve the matter, but was unable to reach him for several weeks. Eventually,
  respondent wired funds to Ms. LeBlanc in three separate installments over a five-day period. Ms. LeBlanc later filed
  a complaint with the ODC as a result of the incident.<span><a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></span></p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Hearing</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC filed formal charges against respondent, alleging commingling and conversion of client
  funds.<span><a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a></span>  Respondent filed an answer, admitting to the misconduct, but
  claiming his actions stemmed from his inexperience in handling client funds, rather than dishonest motive. He
  acknowledged his "bookkeeping left a great deal to be desired" and that he had taken measures to rectify the problem
  by retaining a certified public accountant to monitor his operating and trust accounts and to advise him on all
  accounting matters.</p>

  <h3>Formal Hearing</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">At the formal hearing, the ODC submitted a report from its expert witness, certified public
  accountant Ronald White. Mr. White testified his investigation revealed respondent used his client trust account as
  both an office account and a trust account. He found a portion of Ms. LeBlanc's funds were used to pay off the
  overdraft in the account. Thus, he determined respondent committed conversion by using a portion of the funds due to
  Ms. LeBlanc for his own personal purposes. However, Mr. White found there was no evidence that respondent's actions
  were intended to be deceptive.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent testified he never kept any money in his trust account, but would instead deposit the
  funds as he wrote checks. As a result, he always had his clients contact him prior to cashing their checks to make
  sure he had time to speak to someone at the bank to guarantee their checks would be honored. He stated he never had
  problems in the past because his clients would generally cash their checks immediately after they received them from
  him.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2000-11-28_00-DB-079.htm">Recommendation of the Hearing
  Committee</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The hearing committee determined respondent violated Rules 1.15(a) (failure to keep client and
  third-party funds separate from the lawyer's own property) and 1.15(b) (failure to promptly deliver funds or property
  owed to a client or third party). It concluded respondent's failure to establish proper accounting practices to
  manage his trust account represented a serious deficiency.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In imposing sanctions, the committee recognized respondent made full restitution to Ms. LeBlanc
  prior to the institution of the disciplinary complaint, and found there was no evidence respondent intended to
  convert client funds. Citing the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, the committee proposed that
  respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months, but that the suspension be fully
  deferred, subject to a one-year period of probation with conditions.<span><a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a></span></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC filed an objection to the leniency of the proposed sanction.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a  href="../DB/2001-07-10_00-DB-079.htm">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board concurred in the finding of the hearing committee that respondent violated
  the professional rules as charged. It noted respondent violated duties owed to his client by failing to hold Ms.
  LeBlanc's funds separate from his own property and failing to timely make her funds available to her due to
  insufficient funds in his account. The board found respondent's actions of commingling and conversion were not
  intentional, but that he knew or should have known that his bookkeeping methods were improper. Citing jurisprudence
  from this court, the board determined the baseline sanction is suspension.<span><a class="fn"
  href="#fn4">4</a></span> Accordingly, the board recommended respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a
  period of one year, with ten months deferred, subject to a one-year period of probation subject to the conditions
  recommended by the hearing committee.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC filed an objection to the leniency of the proposed sanction.  Accordingly, the case was
  docketed for briefing and argument in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
  11(G).</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The record clearly establishes that respondent commingled and converted client funds in violation
  of Rule 1.15 of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Therefore, the sole issue before us is the appropriate sanction
  for respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In making a determination of the appropriate sanction, we are mindful that the purpose of lawyer
  disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to maintain appropriate standards of
  professional conduct to safeguard the public, to preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and to deter other
  lawyers from engaging in violations of the standards of the profession. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Guidry</i>, <a  href="1990-12-03_1988-0829.htm">571 So. 2d 161</a> (La. 1990)</span>. The
  discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered
  in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v.
  Whittington</i>, <a  href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Commingling and conversion are among the most serious professional breaches an attorney can
  commit. Aggravating factors exist in this case, including respondent's prior disciplinary
  offenses,<span><a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a></span> pattern of misconduct stemming from the long history of
  mishandling his trust account, and substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted 1991). However,
  significant mitigating factors are present, such as respondent's absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, his
  cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings, his good character and reputation, remorse, and his timely
  good faith effort to make restitution and rectify the consequences of his misconduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Following the guidelines set forth in <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v.
  Hinrichs</i>, <a  href="1986-03-31_1984-1459.htm">486 So. 2d 116</a> (La. 1986)</span>, a suspension
  from the practice of law of at least one year is warranted under these facts. Nonetheless, we are convinced that
  respondent's actions resulted more from negligence than an intentional desire on his part to convert client funds.
  Respondent has recognized his deficiencies and has made efforts to avoid future problems. Under these circumstances,
  we will suspend respondent from the practice of law for a period of one year, but defer all but six months of that
  suspension, subject to a one-year period of probation governed by the conditions recommended by the hearing
  committee. Any misconduct during the probationary period will be grounds for making the deferred period of suspension
  executory and/or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate.<span><a class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a></span></p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, briefs and oral argument, it is ordered that Donald R. Dobbins be suspended from the
  practice of law for a period of one year. All but six months of the suspension shall be deferred, subject to a
  one-year period of probation governed by the conditions recommended by the hearing committee. It is further ordered
  that any misconduct during the probationary period will be grounds for making the deferred period of suspension
  executory and/or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed
  against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, §10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from
  the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  error to the attention of the hearing committee, advising the proper rule violations were Rules 1.15(a) (failure to
  keep client and third-party funds separate from the lawyer's own property) and
  <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=RULE1.15$t=document-frameset.htm" >1.15</a>(b) (failure to promptly

  <a  href="1986-03-31_1984-1459.htm">486 So. 2d 116</a> (La. 1986)</span>, in which this  court suspended an
  attorney for two years for gross negligence in the handling of client funds. The board also relied on

  suspension, fully deferred, subject to a one-year period of supervised probation with conditions was imposed by
  consent on an attorney with a prior disciplinary record, who mishandled $2,000 in client funds), and
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Jones</i>, 99-0971 (La. 11/6/98), <a  href="1998-11-06_1998-0971.htm">721

  imposed on an attorney without a prior disciplinary record, who withheld $2,500 from a client's settlement to pay

  on numerous occasions).</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5" id="fn5">5</a> On April 20, 1998, respondent was admonished for violating Rule
  1.5(c) when he failed to have a contingency fee agreement in a case. See No. 99-ADB-025. On February 25, 1999,
  respondent was admonished again for violating Rule 1.5(c) when he failed to have contingency fee agreements in two
  client matters and failed to provide a client an accounting in a case he handled in the early 1990's. See No.
  99-ADB-017.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn6" id="fn6">6</a> The question of deferral of all or part of a suspension has
  caused some confusion in the past. Without some mechanism to make the deferral executory, deferral is meaningless.
  Accordingly, in cases where the disciplinary board recommends that all or part of a suspension be deferred, it should
  also recommend either a period of probation, or a period within which the deferred suspension may become executory,
  in the event of misconduct by the respondent during this period.</p>
