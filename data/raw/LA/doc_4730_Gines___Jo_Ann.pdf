  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 03-B-2827</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: JOANN GINES</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, JoAnn Gines, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC filed two sets of formal charges against respondent.  The first, consisting of one count
  and bearing the disciplinary board's docket number 99-DB-095, was filed on September 27, 1999 and supplemented and
  amended on June 14, 2002.  The second set of formal charges, bearing the disciplinary board's docket number
  00-DB-044, was filed on March 3, 2000 and encompasses three counts of misconduct.</p>

  <h3>99-DB-095</h3>

  <h4>The Ferguson Matter</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">In July 1997, Martha Ferguson retained respondent to review and notarize documents relating to
  Ms. Ferguson's sale of an annuity to the J. G. Wentworth S.S.C. Limited Partnership ("Wentworth").  Respondent
  performed the services and charged Ms. Ferguson a fee of 20% of the sales price, amounting to approximately $4,000. 
  Ms. Ferguson was dissatisfied with the fee retained by respondent, but respondent declined to refund any portion of
  the fee, contending that it was fully earned.  Furthermore, in connection with the sale, respondent instructed
  Wentworth's representatives to wire transfer the sales proceeds to a specified bank account maintained by respondent
  at Hibernia National Bank.  The wire transfer was accomplished pursuant to respondent's instructions, and she later
  disbursed funds to Ms. Ferguson from that account.  However, the Hibernia account contained respondent's personal
  funds and was not a client trust account.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct violated the following provisions of the Louisiana
  Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.5</span> (fee arrangements),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.15(a)</span> (failure to hold client property separate from the lawyer's own property),
  and <span class="allegedrules">1.15(c)</span> (failure to deposit disputed funds in trust).</p>

  <h3>00-DB-044</h3>

  <h4>Count I - The Pipkins Matter</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">In July 1998, Joan Pipkins, a resident of South Carolina, paid respondent $1,146.01 to handle the
  succession of her late mother, a Shreveport resident.  Ms. Pipkins gave respondent her mother's will and other
  original documents.  Respondent prepared some pleadings in the succession matter, but she did not file them, nor did
  she complete the matter.  Ms. Pipkins made numerous attempts to communicate with respondent for over one year, but to
  no avail.  Respondent also failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the complaint filed by Ms.
  Pipkins.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct violated the following provisions of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct: Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable diligence and
  promptness in representing a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a client),
  1.5, 1.15 (safekeeping property of clients or third persons), and <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure
  to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation).</p>

  <h4>Count II - The Edwards Matter</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">In August 1996, Calvin Edwards retained respondent to handle a medical malpractice matter against
  a Shreveport hospital.  At the time of the retention, the hospital had an outstanding settlement offer to Mr. Edwards
  in the amount of $60,000.00.  On September 3, 1996, counsel for the hospital wrote to respondent increasing its
  settlement offer to $62,500.00.  Respondent took no action in response to the settlement offer, nor did she file suit
  on behalf of Mr. Edwards or otherwise protect his interests before his malpractice claim prescribed. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">When Mr. Edwards attempted to contact respondent in 1998 to inquire about his malpractice claim,
  respondent failed to return his telephone calls.  Thereafter, when Mr. Edwards was finally able to speak with
  respondent, she falsely represented the status of the matter, asserting that prescription had been interrupted and
  that the case was pending before a medical review panel.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct violated the following provisions of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct: Rules 1.3, 1.4, <span class="allegedrules">1.8</span> (conflict of interest/prohibited
  transactions between a client and a lawyer), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving
  dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct
  prejudicial to the administration of justice).</p>

  <h4>Count III - The McClave Matter</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">In January 1999, Alice McClave paid respondent $500 to handle a sexual harassment and employment
  discrimination claim.  While respondent forwarded a letter to Ms. McClave's employer concerning the matter, she
  failed to take any further action.  Ms. McClave made numerous attempts to contact respondent, but to no avail.  When
  respondent finally spoke to her client, the statute of limitations had run on the claim.  Notwithstanding, respondent
  demanded an additional fee to take further measures in the matter. Respondent also failed to cooperate with the ODC
  in its investigation of the complaint filed by Ms. McClave.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct violated the following provisions of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct: Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span>, and 8.4(c).</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent initially did not file an answer to either set of formal charges, and the factual
  allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence.  The disciplinary
  board consolidated the two sets of formal charges and recommended respondent be disbarred.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent then made her first formal appearance in the proceedings by filing an objection in
  this court to the disciplinary board's recommendation.  In her brief and at oral argument, respondent asserted that
  her failure to participate in the disciplinary process was unintentional and stemmed from her incapacity to respond
  to the charges of misconduct.<a name="_ftnref1" class="fn" href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">1</a> After reviewing the
  evidence presented by respondent in support of her allegations, we agreed that she was unable to meaningfully
  participate in the disciplinary proceedings.  Accordingly, we vacated the orders of the hearing committee deeming the
  formal charges admitted, and we remanded the matter for a formal hearing before a hearing committee. 
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Gines</i>, 01-2844 (La. 4/19/02), <a href="2002-04-19_2001-2844.htm">817 So. 2d
  1122</a>.</span></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Following remand, respondent answered the formal charges and denied any misconduct in connection
  with her handling of the client matters at issue.  The matter then proceeded to a formal hearing on the merits, which
  was conducted by the hearing committee on August 1, 2002.  Despite notice, respondent did not appear at the
  hearing.</p>

  <h3><span class="CITE"><a href="../HC/2002-09-19_99-DB-095.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">After reviewing the evidence presented at the hearing, the hearing committee made the following
  factual findings and legal conclusions:</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In 99-DB-095, the Ferguson matter, the committee found that respondent's work on her client's
  behalf consisted of reviewing some sixty pages of documents, with which she was already familiar, advising Ms.
  Ferguson, and notarizing her signature on several of the documents.  This was an uncomplicated legal matter, and the
  work was performed in one day.  There was no written retainer or contingency fee agreement between respondent and Ms.
  Ferguson, but respondent had previously performed similar legal services for Ms. Ferguson and had charged her a $500
  fee.  Nevertheless, after respondent received the proceeds of the annuity sale from Wentworth, she deducted 20% or
  $3,995.00 as her fee and delivered the remainder, $16,000.00, to Ms. Ferguson.  Ms. Ferguson testified that until she
  received the $16,000.00 check, she was unaware that respondent intended to charge her 20% to handle the sales
  transaction.  The committee concluded that by her conduct in this matter, respondent charged an excessive fee in
  violation of Rule 1.5of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  Furthermore, after a dispute arose as to the fees,
  respondent failed to deposit the disputed amount in trust until the dispute was resolved, in violation of Rule
  <span class="Rules">1.15(c)</span>.<a name="_ftnref2" class="fn" href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">2</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In Count I of 00-DB-044, the Pipkins matter, the committee found that respondent was paid
  $1,146.01 to handle a succession matter.  Respondent failed to communicate with Ms. Pipkin, did little or no work in
  the succession matter, and did not account to her client for the legal fee she was paid.  The committee concluded
  that by her conduct in this matter, respondent violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span>,
  <span class="Rules">1.4</span>, and <span class="Rules">1.5</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In Count II of 00-DB-044, the Edwards matter, the committee found that in August 1996, Calvin
  Edwards retained respondent to handle a medical malpractice claim against a Shreveport hospital stemming from an
  injury that occurred in January 1996.  Respondent received the file from Mr. Edwards' prior attorney well in advance
  of the prescriptive date, yet she failed to communicate with her client or to file suit or any claim with the medical
  review panel to protect her client's interest.  Rather, respondent allowed Mr. Edwards' claim to prescribe, and then
  she deceived him as to the status of the case by falsely representing that she had filed a claim.  The committee
  concluded that by her conduct in this matter, respondent violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span>,
  and <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Finally, in Count III of 00-DB-044, the McClave matter, the committee found that in January 1999,
  Alice McClave hired respondent to pursue a sexual harassment and discrimination claim against her employer.  On
  January 22, 1999, Ms. McClave paid respondent $500.00 for her services.  On February 12, 1999, respondent wrote a
  letter to the employer stating that she would file an EEOC claim within 10 days if she received no response.  Ms.
  McClave repeatedly sought to contact respondent regarding her claim but never received a response.  Respondent failed
  to account for the fee received or to refund the unearned portion of the same. An EEOC claim was never timely filed
  by respondent on behalf of Alice McClave.  The committee concluded that by her conduct in this matter, respondent
  violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The committee noted that respondent has demonstrated a consistent pattern of disregard for her
  obligations under the Rules of Professional Conduct,<a name="_ftnref3" class="fn" href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">3</a>
  and that despite her earlier assertions of incapacity, she presented no evidence at the hearing on remand to
  substantiate her claims.  The committee further found that respondent's conduct was intentional in part, knowing in
  part, and negligent in part.  Considering these facts, and in light of respondent's failure to make restitution to
  her former clients, the committee recommended that respondent be disbarred.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On February 20, 2003, five months after the hearing committee issued its recommendation,
  respondent filed a pleading with the disciplinary board in which she asserted that she is unable to participate in
  these proceedings due to depression.  Respondent also objected to the sanction recommended by the hearing
  committee.</p>

  <h3><span class="CITE"><a href="../DB/2003-10-10_99-DB-095.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board found the hearing committee's findings of fact are not manifestly
  erroneous, and that its application of the Rules of Professional Conduct was proper, with the exception of the
  committee's failure to find that respondent did not cooperate with the ODC's investigation in the Pipkins and McClave
  matters (Counts I and III, respectively, of 00-DB-044).  In both of those matters, respondent's initial failure to
  cooperate caused the ODC to have to take depositions and/or sworn statements.  Accordingly, in addition to the rule
  violations found by the committee, the board concluded that respondent violated Rule 8.1(c) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The board determined respondent violated duties owed to her clients and to the profession.  The
  board further determined that respondent's conduct was knowing, if not intentional, and caused actual harm to her
  clients.  The baseline sanction for this conduct ranges from suspension to disbarment.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The board found the following aggravating factors are present: <span class="ABAstandard">prior
  disciplinary offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply
  with rules and orders of the disciplinary agency</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the
  victim</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span> (admitted 1984), and
  <span class="ABAstandard">indifference to making restitution</span>.  The board also found that respondent suffers
  from depression and that the mitigating factor of <span class="ABAstandard">personal or emotional problems</span> is
  present.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In light of these considerations, the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, and
  the prior jurisprudence, the board concluded that disbarment is the appropriate sanction.  The board also recommended
  respondent be ordered to make restitution to her clients, and that she be assessed with all costs and expenses of
  these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of the court's
  judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent's misconduct includes a pattern of neglect of legal matters, failure to communicate
  with clients, and failure to account for her fees.  Respondent has demonstrated a serious lack of concern for the
  welfare of her clients.  Additionally, respondent has charged a clearly excessive legal fee and has failed to
  cooperate with the disciplinary authorities.  The baseline sanction for such misconduct ranges from a lengthy
  suspension to disbarment.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Numerous aggravating factors are present, including respondent's prior disciplinary offenses,
  dishonest or selfish motive, pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of
  the conduct, vulnerability of the victim, substantial experience in the practice of law, and indifference to making
  restitution.  While some mitigating factors are apparent from the record, those factors pale in comparison to the
  applicable aggravating factors.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The record demonstrates in a convincing fashion that respondent lacks concern for the welfare of
  her clients and shows a total disregard for her professional obligations.  She lacks the fitness to practice law in
  this state.  Under these circumstances, she must be disbarred.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that the name of JoAnn Gines, Louisiana Bar Roll number 8399, be stricken
  from the roll of attorneys and that her license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked.  It is further
  ordered that respondent render a full accounting to Martha Ferguson, Joan Pipkins, and Alice McClave and that she
  refund any unearned fees due those clients.  All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in
  accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality
  of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn1" class="fn" href="#_ftnref1" id="_ftn1">1</a> Respondent maintained that she
  suffered from depression and/or some other mental problem, which required that she be hospitalized for an extended
  period of time at a psychiatric facility. </p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn2" class="fn" href="#_ftnref2" id="_ftn2">2</a> Though the ODC did not raise the
  issue in this court, we observe that neither the hearing committee nor the disciplinary board made a finding as to
  the commingling allegations set forth in the ODC's supplemental and amended formal charges.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn3" class="fn" href="#_ftnref3" id="_ftn3">3</a> In 1989, respondent was publicly
  reprimanded by the Committee on Professional Responsibility of the Louisiana State Bar Association for improperly
  soliciting a client.  In 1994, respondent was admonished by the disciplinary board in 94-ADB-033 for failing to
  cooperate with the ODC in a disciplinary investigation.</p>
