<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 01-B-2584</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: MARK V. MARINOFF</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p><b>PER CURIAM<a href="#fn_">*</a></b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary matter arises from a recommendation of the 
disciplinary board that the formal charges against respondent, Mark V. Marinoff, 
be dismissed. Following a request of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) 
for review of that recommendation, this court ordered briefing from the parties 
and set the matter on the docket for oral argument.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">On the evening of November 17, 1994, respondent, an assistant city/parish 
attorney in Baton Rouge, went to the Pastime Bar &amp; Lounge in Baton Rouge with 
his secretary, Sandra Book.<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> Respondent and Mrs. Book consumed a significant 
amount of alcohol over the course of the evening, and the evidence shows that 
both were intoxicated when they departed the bar together in respondent’s new 
Ford Mustang convertible.<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> Traveling down River Road in East Baton Rouge Parish 
at a high rate of speed, respondent lost control of the vehicle and struck a 
ditch, causing the car to roll over several times before it came to rest 
upside-down on the levee, several hundred feet from the point where it first 
left the road. Respondent received relatively minor injuries in the accident; 
Mrs. Book was ejected from the car and thrown some distance away.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">A short time later, Jerry Ghoram and Veronica Hayes were driving down River Road 
past the scene of the accident when they heard someone yelling for help. They 
stopped and found respondent standing away from his vehicle, complaining that he 
had “wrecked his “f * * * ing car.” Respondent also said that everyone in the 
car was dead and that he had killed everyone in the car. Mr. Ghoram and Ms. 
Hayes went immediately to the nearest house and called 911. When they returned, 
respondent was standing near the road. He asked them several times to take him 
away from the scene, indicating he did not want any attention drawn to himself 
because he had “already been in trouble once before.”<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> Contrary to his earlier 
statements that everyone in the car was dead, respondent now claimed that there 
was no one else in the car and that no one was dead. He demanded repeatedly that 
Mr. Ghoram and Ms. Hayes not call for help because he did not need any help. 
When told that an ambulance was already on its way, respondent cursed Mr. Ghoram 
and Ms. Hayes, “telling us to just take him away from the scene, there wasn’t 
nobody in the car, . . .” However, Ms. Hayes spotted a child’s car seat near the 
wreckage and decided to look around to make sure that no one else had been 
injured in the accident. She then stumbled over Mrs. Book, who was sprawled on 
the ground near a fence, severely injured. Ms. Hayes stayed with Mrs. Book and 
prayed with her until the ambulance arrived. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana State Trooper Terry Mayeaux arrived at the accident scene after 
everyone had gone. He found respondent’s car upside-down on the levee, took some 
photographs, and called for a tow truck. After learning that the car belonged to 
respondent, whom he knew well, Trooper Mayeaux went to the hospital where 
respondent and Mrs. Book were being treated. At the hospital, respondent claimed 
to have no recollection of the accident. He repeatedly denied that he was 
driving the car when the accident occurred; instead, he insisted that he had 
been asleep and that a man named “Jason” was driving. Knowing there was no other 
male passenger in the car, Trooper Mayeaux told respondent to “get off of the 
Jason story.” Respondent made no further reference to “Jason” but continued to 
maintain that he (respondent) was not the driver. Nevertheless, following an 
investigation by the district attorney’s office, respondent was indicted by a 
grand jury on a misdemeanor charge of negligent injuring, a violation of
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.legis.state.la.us/tsrs/tsrs.asp?lawbody=RS&title=14&section=39">La. R.S. 
14:39</a>. The state subsequently filed a bill of particulars alleging that 
respondent was driving the car at the time of the accident.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The criminal case proceeded to trial in July 1997. Respondent did not testify 
during the two-day bench trial. After considering the evidence presented, the 
district court concluded that sufficient evidence existed to find beyond a 
reasonable doubt that respondent was driving the car at the time of the accident 
and that the accident resulted from criminal negligence which caused grave 
injuries to Mrs. Book. The district court also concluded that respondent made a 
conscious effort to conceal his involvement in the accident:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]t was apparent from the very beginning your purpose was to shield your 
involvement in this accident. You first indicated that the other persons in the 
vehicle were dead. You later stated that you were the only person in the vehicle 
and you made repeated attempts to have them simply take you away from the scene, 
not to wait for the ambulance, not to stay there and receive medical attention 
for your own injuries. Your primary concern was to be taken away from the scene 
of the accident and not have any attention drawn to you in this incident. That 
indicates, in my mind, an active intention on your part to evade any liability 
for what occurred in this case. Had the passersby not used their own good 
judgment and had they taken you away from the scene and had they not taken the 
effort to look for other people who were in the vehicle, there is a good chance 
that Sandy Book would not have survived her injuries. . . . When you go to the 
hospital, you speak to a trooper who happens to be a friend and acquaintance of 
all the parties involved, . . . you indicated that there was a third person, a 
phantom driver, an individual by the name of Jason who you said took you away 
from the Pastime because you were too intoxicated to drive and that that person 
had fled the scene of the accident. Again, in the court’s estimation, that was a 
deliberate attempt on your part to shield yourself from any responsibility in 
this case. . . . [I]t’s clear to me from your actions at the scene and at the 
hospital you not only remembered the accident, but you were conscious enough of 
your own actions to make deliberate efforts to conceal your culpability in this 
matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Bodycopy">The district court found respondent guilty of negligent injuring and sentenced 
him to six months imprisonment with all but fifteen days suspended, which were 
ordered to be served on alternating weekends. Respondent sought review of his 
conviction and sentence by application for supervisory writs, which were denied 
by the court of appeal and by this court.<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a></p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Through counsel, respondent self-reported his conviction to the ODC in July 
1997. The ODC filed one count of formal charges on January 16, 1998, alleging 
violations of Rules <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a></span>(a) (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct), 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a></span>(b) (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on the lawyer’s 
honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a></span>(c) (engaging in conduct 
involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a></span>(d) (engaging 
in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct.5 Respondent answered the formal charges and denied that 
his misdemeanor conviction reflected adversely on his fitness as a lawyer.</p>
<h3>Formal Hearing</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">At the formal hearing, the ODC introduced documentary evidence in support of the 
formal charges, including the transcript of respondent’s criminal trial and 
sentencing. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent testified on his own behalf, but indicated he has a very limited 
recollection of the evening of the accident. Describing his condition that night 
as “out of it,” respondent testified that he remembers going to the Pastime and 
drinking with Mrs. Book, but the next thing he remembers is “being in an 
ambulance.”<a class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a> Respondent attributed his inability to recall the accident itself, 
or the events which occurred immediately thereafter, to a concussion he claimed 
to have suffered in the accident. Respondent specifically denied any 
recollection of asking Mr. Ghoram and Ms. Hayes to take him away from the scene 
of the accident. However, he admitted he “may have said those things, . . . I 
don’t recall.” Respondent testified that the accident and its aftermath caused a 
great deal of harm to his family, both emotionally and financially,<a class="fn" href="#fn7">7</a> and 
strained his relationship with Mr. and Mrs. Book, with whom he no longer 
speaks.<a class="fn" href="#fn8">8</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent also called as witnesses Frank Gremillion, an attorney and former 
member of the Disciplinary Board and the Committee on Professional 
Responsibility, and retired Judge Frank Saia. Both of these witnesses testified 
that in their opinion respondent’s conviction of negligent injuring does not 
adversely reflect upon his fitness to practice law.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- ID:98-DB-002.HC --">Recommendation of the Hearing Committee
</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After consideration, the hearing committee recommended that the formal charges 
against respondent be dismissed, on the ground that the ODC failed to prove the 
alleged violations by sufficient clear and convincing evidence. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As a preliminary matter, the committee noted that it was not bound by the 
factual findings made in respondent’s criminal trial because his conviction was 
not yet final at the time of the hearing. Furthermore, after considering the 
testimony of the witnesses and the evidence presented, the committee concluded 
that respondent’s actions on the night of the accident do not constitute a 
violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. In particular, the committee 
found respondent’s actions do not reflect adversely on his honesty, 
trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer. In reaching this conclusion, the 
committee primarily relied on its determination that respondent was not being 
dishonest when he stated he suffered a head injury in the accident and 
consequently had no recollection of the events of that evening.<a class="fn" href="#fn9">9
</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee’s failure to find a 
violation of the professional rules.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- ID:98-DB-002.DB --">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board reluctantly accepted the findings and recommendation of 
the hearing committee and agreed that the formal charges should be dismissed. 
Based on its review of the record, the board concluded there was no manifest 
error in the committee’s factual findings that respondent was unable to remember 
the accident and that his memory loss was attributable to a concussion he 
suffered in the accident. While the board indicated it probably would have 
reached a different conclusion had it been the trier of fact, it recognized the 
committee’s findings were not clearly wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It cannot be said that the Committee committed manifest error when it chose to 
believe respondent’s testimony that he could not remember the accident or 
explain his actions post-accident over the trial judge’s belief that 
Respondent’s actions were intentional and calculated to shield himself from 
responsibility. Certainly, Respondent’s claim of memory loss is convenient and 
were this Board free to make an independent factual finding on this issue, 
unfettered by the manifest error standard of review, perhaps a different 
conclusion would be reached. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Bodycopy">Having found no manifest error in the committee’s factual findings, the board 
accepted the committee’s legal conclusion that respondent’s actions did not 
violate the Rules of Professional Conduct. In particular, it noted that in the 
absence of a finding of intentional, deliberate, or calculated behavior on 
respondent’s part, there was no conduct that reflected adversely on his honesty, 
trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer, nor conduct that is dishonest, 
deceitful, or prejudicial to the administration of justice for purposes of Rule 
8.4. Accordingly, the disciplinary board recommended that the formal charges 
against respondent be dismissed. <br>
The ODC sought review in this court of the disciplinary board’s recommendation. 
This court set the matter on the docket for oral argument and ordered briefing 
from the parties “addressing the issue of whether the disciplinary board erred 
in dismissing the charges against respondent, and if so, what type of sanction 
would be appropriate in this case.”<a class="fn" href="#fn10">10</a></p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. 
La. Const. art. V, §5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an 
independent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has 
been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 
11/30/94), <a href="#!-- #ID:646%20So.2d%20343 --#">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; 
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Boutall</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:597%20So.2d%20444 --#">597 So. 2d 444</a> 
(La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in any way by the findings and 
recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held 
the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee’s factual findings. 
See <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Caulfield</i>, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:683%20So.2d%20714 --#">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; 
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 
93-2865 (La. 3/11/94),<a href="#!-- #ID: 633%20So.2d%20150 --#"> 633 So. 2d 150</a></span>. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In disciplinary proceedings based upon an attorney’s conviction of a crime, 
evidence of the conviction constitutes conclusive evidence of the attorney’s 
guilt of the charged offense, and the attorney may not offer any evidence which 
is inconsistent with the essential elements of the crime. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Huddleston</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:595%20So.2d%201141 --#">595 
So. 2d 1141</a> (La. 1992)</span>. The difficulty presented in the case at hand is that the 
conduct which forms the basis of the disciplinary charges encompasses more than 
the criminal offense itself. In particular, we must determine whether respondent 
acted intentionally in attempting to draw suspicion away from himself following 
the accident. In the context of respondent’s criminal trial, the district court 
made a specific factual finding that respondent acted intentionally in 
attempting to shield himself from culpability; however, the fact that the 
offender intentionally engaged in deceitful conduct is not an essential element 
of the crime of negligent injuring. Rather, the sole element of the crime, as 
set forth in La. R.S. 14:39, is “the inflicting of any injury upon the person of 
another by criminal negligence.” “Criminal negligence” is defined in La. R.S. 
14:12 as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Criminal negligence exists when, although neither specific nor general criminal 
intent is present, there is such disregard of the interest of others that the 
offender's conduct amounts to a gross deviation below the standard of care 
expected to be maintained by a reasonably careful man under like circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Bodycopy">Reading La. R.S. 14:39 together with La. R.S. 14:12, it is clear that an intent 
to deceive persons in order to shield the offender from culpability following an 
accident is not an essential element of the crime of negligent injuring. 
Accordingly, the district court’s factual finding that respondent intended to 
deceive others to shield himself from culpability was not essential to the 
conviction. Respondent is, therefore, not precluded from offering evidence on 
this issue in a subsequent bar disciplinary proceeding.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">While respondent’s post-accident conduct is not an essential element of the 
crime under La. R.S. 14:39, it is highly relevant to the question of whether he 
engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation for 
purposes of Rule 8.4(c). The ODC proved by clear and convincing evidence that 
respondent made the post-accident statements.<a class="fn" href="#fn11">11</a> Taken objectively, the content 
of the statements evidences an intent to deceive or misrepresent the facts, as 
the thrust of the statements was that respondent was the sole occupant of the 
vehicle, a fact which was unquestionably false. Therefore, the ODC satisfied its 
burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that respondent made 
statements which violated Rule 8.4(c). At this point, the burden shifted to 
respondent to prove his lack of culpability for the statements.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent argued in defense that he suffered a head injury in the accident and 
as a result should not be held legally responsible for what he said after the 
accident. In order to assert this defense, respondent was essentially required 
to prove two elements: (1) that he sustained a head injury, and (2) that the 
nature of the head injury was such that it impaired his consciousness and 
ability to understand what he was saying.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As to the first element, the hearing committee accepted respondent’s testimony 
that he sustained a head injury as a result of the accident. While the evidence 
on this point is somewhat questionable, we cannot say that factual finding is 
clearly wrong based on our review of the record. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">With regard to the second element, the record demonstrates that respondent 
introduced no evidence, such as testimony from expert witnesses, which would 
have established that the head injury he suffered in the accident was sufficient 
to impair his responsibility for the statements. Ordinary human experience 
suggests that head injuries can encompass a range of conditions, from total 
unconsciousness to mild disorientation. In the absence of any evidence which 
would prove respondent’s injury was significant enough to impair his 
consciousness, we find the hearing committee erred when it automatically assumed 
that respondent’s head injury completely absolved him of any responsibility for 
his statements. On the evidence presented, we cannot say respondent proved his 
head injury was sufficient to deprive him of culpability for his statements.<a class="fn" href="#fn12">12
</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Having found the ODC proved a violation of Rule 8.4(c), we now turn to the 
appropriate sanction for respondent’s misconduct. In doing so, we are mindful 
that the purpose of disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the 
lawyer, but rather to maintain the appropriate standards of professional 
conduct, to preserve the integrity of the legal profession and to deter other 
lawyers from engaging in violations of the standards of the profession.<span class="CITE">

the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating 
and mitigating circumstances.<span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Redd</i>, 95-1472 (La. 9/15/95),

<p class="Bodycopy">We have found that respondent’s post-accident conduct involved elements of 
fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c). Such conduct is 
particularly egregious because it occurred while respondent was serving as an 
assistant city/parish attorney. This court has previously held that an attorney 
occupying a position of public trust is held to a higher standard of conduct 
than an ordinary attorney. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Naccari</i>, 97 1546 (La. 12/19/97),

<a href="#!-- #ID:694%20So.2d%20906 --#">694 So. 2d 906</a></span>. It is also 
significant that respondent’s accident and the subsequent criminal proceedings 
received some coverage in the local media. Such adverse publicity causes harm to 
the public’s perception of the legal profession. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Bankston</i>, 01 2780 (La. 
3/8/02), <a href="#!-- #ID:810%20So.2d%201113 --#">810 So. 2d 1113</a></span>. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Although no actual harm resulted from respondent’s post-accident conduct, there 
was clearly a great potential for harm. Mrs. Book was thrown from the car in the 
accident, and she suffered grave injuries as a result. Had the bystanders 
accepted respondent’s statement that he was the sole occupant of the car, a 
strong possibility exists that Mrs. Book’s body would not have been discovered 
and that she would not have survived her injuries.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering these facts, we conclude respondent engaged in fraud, deceit, or 
misrepresentation which had the potential for causing injury. The baseline 
sanction for such misconduct is a suspension from the practice of law.<a class="fn" href="#fn13">13</a> As 
aggravating factors, we recognize respondent’s prior disciplinary record, 
vulnerability of the victim, and his substantial experience in the practice of 
law (admitted 1984). In mitigation, we find respondent made full and free 
disclosure to the disciplinary board, as demonstrated by his self-reporting of 
the misconduct. Other mitigating factors include respondent’s good character and 
reputation and the imposition of other penalties resulting from his criminal 
conviction.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering the facts of this case, we conclude the appropriate sanction for 
respondent’s misconduct is a suspension from the practice of law for a period of 
six months. </p>
<h2>DECREE </h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and the 
disciplinary board, and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is 
ordered that Mark V. Marinoff be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana 
for a period of six months. All costs and expenses in this matter are assessed 
against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal 
interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s 
judgment until paid. <br>

involved in an accident, as his first words to the bystanders were to the effect 
that he had “wrecked his “f * * * ing car.” Likewise, respondent was aware that 
there could be criminal ramifications as a result of the accident, indicating he 
did not want any attention drawn to himself because he had “already been in 
trouble once before.” Respondent was presumably remembering his prior DWI

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn13">13</a> The evidence is insufficient to support the conclusion that respondent made
