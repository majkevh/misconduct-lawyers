  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 04-B-0168</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: CHESTER JOHN CASKEY, JR.</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This matter arises from a petition for consent discipline filed by respondent, Chester John
  Caskey, Jr., an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.  For his misconduct, respondent proposed that he be
  suspended from the practice of law for six months, fully deferred, subject to a one-year period of supervised
  probation with conditions.  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") concurred in respondent's petition, and the
  disciplinary board recommended the proposed discipline be accepted.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent retained attorney's fees in his client trust account for a period of several months in
  1997 and 1998, thereby commingling his funds with those of his clients.  Respondent's trust account records for that
  time period reveal no evidence of any conversion of client funds.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Petition for Consent Discipline</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Prior to the institution of formal charges, respondent filed a petition for consent discipline,
  admitting his conduct violated Rule <span class="Rules">1.15(a)</span> (safekeeping property of clients or third
  persons) of the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct.  For his misconduct, respondent proposed that he be
  suspended from the practice of law for six months, fully deferred, subject to a one-year period of supervised
  probation with the condition that quarterly audits of his trust account are to be performed by a CPA during the
  period of probation.  The ODC concurred in respondent's petition for consent discipline.</p>

  <h3><span class="CITE"><a href="../DB/2004-01-16_03-DB-015.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board found that respondent's conduct was negligent and violated a duty owed to
  his clients.  Potential injury was present in that client funds were commingled with attorney's fees, and withdrawals
  were made from the trust account.  However, no actual injury is apparent from the record.  The baseline sanction for
  such misconduct is a suspension from the practice of law.<a name="_ftnref1" class="fn" href="#_ftn1"
  id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board determined the sole aggravating factor present is <span class="ABAstandard">substantial
  experience in the practice of law</span> (admitted 1978).  In mitigation, the board recognized the
  <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a
  dishonest or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">personal problems</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">full and free disclosure to disciplinary counsel</span>, and
  <span class="ABAstandard">character or reputation</span>.  After reviewing the prior jurisprudence of this court
  dealing with misconduct similar to respondent's,<a name="_ftnref2" class="fn" href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> the
  board determined the proposed consent discipline is appropriate.  Accordingly, the board recommended that respondent
  be suspended from the practice of law for six months, fully deferred, subject to a one-year period of supervised
  probation governed by the conditions set forth in the petition for consent discipline.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As the petition for consent discipline demonstrates, respondent has improperly handled his client
  trust account, in violation of Rule 1.15 of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  However, it is undisputed that there
  is no evidence of conversion of client funds, nor is there any evidence respondent's conduct caused any harm to his
  clients.  Given these facts, and in light of the mitigating factors present, we conclude the proposed fully deferred
  suspension is appropriate. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the petition for consent discipline.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the
  record filed herein, it is ordered that Chester John Caskey, Louisiana Bar Roll number 3981, be suspended from the
  practice of law in Louisiana for a period of six months.  It is further ordered that said suspension shall be fully
  deferred, subject to respondent's successful completion of a one-year period of supervised probation governed by the
  conditions set forth in the petition for consent discipline.  Any violation of the conditions of probation or any
  other misconduct during the probationary period may be grounds for making the deferred portion of the suspension
  executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate.  All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed
  against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days
  from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <span class="ABAstandard">4.12</span> of the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> provides that
  suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knows or should know that he is dealing improperly with client

  330</a></span>, in which the lawyer was suspended for six months, fully deferred, for failing to remove legal fees
  from his client trust account.</p>
