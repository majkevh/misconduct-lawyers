SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 02-B-0149</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: WALTER C. DUMAS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p><b>PER CURIAM</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary proceeding arises from one count of formal charges filed by 
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Walter C. Dumas, 
an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">In April 1995, Vanessa Bolinger retained respondent to represent her in 
connection with a personal injury matter stemming from a vehicular accident. 
Approximately one year later, respondent settled the personal injury claim for 
$7,250. Respondent apparently indicated to Ms. Bolinger that she would receive 
sufficient proceeds from the settlement to allow her to purchase a used vehicle 
to replace her vehicle, which had been totaled in the accident.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On April 2, 1996, Ms. Bolinger went to respondent’s office where she endorsed 
the settlement check. At that time, respondent learned his client’s share of the 
settlement would not be enough to allow her to purchase the car. As a result, 
respondent agreed to reduce his legal fee from $2,400 to $992.50. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent provided Ms. Bolinger with $500 in cash claiming it was an “advance” 
on the settlement since it would allegedly take approximately ten days for the 
check to clear the bank. Moreover, respondent advised Ms. Bolinger that he would 
withhold the funds owed to the third party medical providers and pay them 
directly. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Because Ms. Bolinger was anxious to purchase the vehicle, respondent wrote a 
letter to the automobile dealership advising that she would be receiving her 
funds in about ten days (April 12, 1996) “or shortly thereafter.”<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> Ms. Bolinger 
gave the dealership the $500 respondent advanced to her and wrote a check to the 
dealership for the balance, $3000. The dealership agreed to hold this check for 
a period of at least ten days.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The following day, respondent cashed the settlement check. However, respondent 
did not place these funds in his client trust account, as that account had been 
seized ten days earlier by the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) 
for non-payment of back taxes due on his law practice.<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> According to respondent, 
his tax attorney advised respondent not to deposit any client funds in his trust 
account, because those funds could be subject to seizure by the IRS. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Five days after cashing the check, respondent gave his client a cash payment of 
$100, representing another “advance” on her settlement so that she could pay 
insurance on the vehicle she intended to purchase. At that time, respondent 
failed to advise his client that he had already cashed the settlement check and 
was personally holding the funds until the check cleared his bank.<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent failed to provide Ms. Bolinger with her funds within ten days of the 
settlement, as he had promised. As a result, when the dealership deposited her 
check, it was returned for insufficient funds. As a consequence, the bank 
imposed NSF charges on Ms. Bolinger’s account, resulting in several of Ms. 
Bolinger’s previously issued checks being dishonored and creating an overdraft 
in her account. While her bank assumed some charges, she was still required to 
go to individual merchants and pay NSF charges that were imposed on the 
dishonored checks.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Ms. Bolinger made numerous attempts to contact respondent by telephone, but to 
no avail. On April 22, 1996, Ms. Bolinger went to respondent’s office. At 
respondent’s direction, his secretary prepared a settlement disbursement sheet, 
which indicated Ms. Bolinger was due $3,100 after the appropriate deductions 
were taken.<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> The secretary provided Ms. Bolinger this amount in cash.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In an effort to protect her interests, Ms. Bolinger contacted her medical 
providers and learned a total of $1,577.50 in outstanding medical expenses were 
still owed. Three days after Ms. Bolinger picked up her file from respondent’s 
office, he had issued three checks, dated May 11, 1996, drawn on his operating 
account and directed to the three medical providers. However, none of the checks 
were forwarded in payment for the services rendered since respondent 
inadvertently failed to send them out after waiting for his accounts to become 
operational with the consent of the IRS and his tax attorney. </p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>The Complaint</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Ms. Bolinger filed a complaint with the ODC advising of respondent’s misconduct. 
In the month following his receipt of the complaint, respondent issued checks to 
two of the medical providers in the amounts of $445 and $458, respectively. In 
the course of the ODC’s investigation, respondent gave a sworn statement 
asserting that, prior to responding to the disciplinary complaint, he had 
believed the three checks issued to the health care providers on May 11, 1996 
had been sent out. Although one of the medical providers had not been paid, 
respondent nevertheless testified that he had since forwarded payment to all 
three health care providers and was able to provide such proof. Finally, ten 
months after the complaint had been filed, respondent paid the last medical 
provider. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, Ms. Bolinger instituted a malpractice suit against respondent. In 
December 1998, respondent paid his former client $10,000 to settle his civil 
liability in connection with the matter.</p>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC instituted one count of formal charges alleging respondent violated 
Rules <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.15 --#">1.15</a>(a)</span> (failure to keep funds of a client or third party separate from 
attorney’s own funds), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.15 --#">1.15</a>(b)</span> (failure to refund and account for client funds) 
and <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or 
misrepresentation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an answer admitting there was delay in paying some of the 
medical providers; however, he urged that the delay was understandable because 
of the confusion surrounding the seizure of his client trust account. He denied 
that there was ever any intent to conceal his actions from his client, or that 
any commingling or conversion of funds took place. In mitigation, respondent 
noted that he had substantially reduced his legal fee, and only sought to 
protect his client’s interest. Finally, he pointed out that his actions did not 
involve a selfish or venal motive, or result in personal gain to him. </p>
<h3>Formal Hearing</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The matter was presented for formal hearing before a hearing committee. Ms. 
Bolinger testified respondent knew her receipt of the settlement funds was 
critical because she was a single mother without transportation and needed to 
purchase a vehicle. She testified as to the injury to her finances based on 
respondent’s failure to timely disburse the funds.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent’s tax attorney, Timothy Burgmeier, testified respondent’s financial 
records were “sloppy, in a little bit of disarray” and there was no segregation 
of each client’s funds from those of respondent. He alleged respondent’s 
operating account had virtually no funds in it at the time the trust account was 
seized. Mr. Burgmeier testified he advised his client not to deposit any funds 
in the seized account, and was unaware of respondent’s handling of the Bolinger 
matter.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent testified that he failed to place the settlement funds in his trust 
account based on the general legal advice given by Mr. Burgmeier, but conceded 
Mr. Burgmeier had no specific knowledge of the Bolinger matter, or that 
respondent cashed the check and withheld the funds. Respondent disputed his 
client’s testimony that he would not speak to her following the period her check 
to the automobile dealership was returned for insufficient funds. Specifically, 
he testified that he had numerous conversations with his client advising her to 
come to his office to get her portion of the funds, but she refused because she 
was unsatisfied with the amount she was to receive.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-085.HC --#">Hearing Committee Recommendation
</a> </h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee found the ODC proved by clear and convincing evidence the 
allegations subject of the formal charges. It determined that respondent 
converted and commingled client funds in violation of Rule 1.15 (failure to safe 
keep client and third party property) and failed to advise his client of the IRS 
lien on his account and the status of payments to the medical providers in 
violation of Rule 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving deceit, dishonesty, 
fraud, or misrepresentation).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Relying on <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Pasquier</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:545%20So.2d%201014 --#">545 So. 2d 1014</a> (La. 1989)</span>, 
the committee found no merit in respondent’s defense that he failed to deposit 
the funds because he feared the money would be seized by the IRS.<a class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a> In support, 
it noted that his retention of funds for his client did not excuse him from 
complying with the professional rules regarding the management of funds. 
Moreover, it pointed out that respondent could have had separately issued checks 
from the bank, rather than cashing the check and retaining the funds. The 
committee found that the record conclusively established respondent did not 
properly account to his client for the disposition of the settlement funds or 
his failure to timely pay the third party medical providers. As aggravating 
factors, the committee recognized respondent’s failure to account for the funds, 
improper use of his operating account to disburse client funds, prior 
disciplinary record,<a class="fn" href="#fn7">7</a> dishonest or selfish motive, lack of remorse, pattern of 
misconduct and multiple offenses. It found respondent did not present credible 
evidence in mitigation. Accordingly, the committee recommended respondent be 
suspended for a period of three years, subject to a one year period of 
supervised probation.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-085.HC --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board accepted the committee’s findings that clear and 
convincing evidence exists to support violations of Rules 1.15(a) (failure to 
keep funds of a client or third party separate from attorney’s own funds), 
1.15(b) (failure to refund and account for client funds) and 8.4(c) (engaging in 
conduct involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation). </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In addressing the issue of sanctions, the board concluded respondent knowingly 
violated duties owed to his client by failing to hold Ms. Bolinger’s funds 
separate from his own and by not making the funds available to her in a timely 
fashion. The board found that respondent knew or should have known that he 
failed to make the funds available within ten days as promised and that he 
failed to timely pay the third party medical providers. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">At the same time, the board recognized respondent’s arguments asserted in 
mitigation. Specifically, it pointed out that $600 in settlement funds were 
delivered to Ms. Bollinger in cash, and the remainder of the funds was paid in 
nineteen days. Also, respondent took a reduction in his legal fee, and the 
medical providers were ultimately paid. Moreover, it pointed out the settlement 
funds were not deposited in respondent’s trust account upon a tax attorney’s 
advice to avoid IRS seizure of the funds. The board maintained that, while it 
did not excuse or justify respondent’s conduct, it did militate against the 
severity of the sanctions to be imposed. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the board recognized respondent’s prior disciplinary 
conduct, dishonest or selfish motive, vulnerability of the victim, substantial 
experience in the practice of law<a class="fn" href="#fn8">8</a> and imposition of other penalties or 
sanctions. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Relying on Standard 4.12 of the ABA’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions,<a class="fn" href="#fn9">9</a> 
the board determined the baseline sanction was suspension. Applying 
jurisprudence from this court,<a class="fn" href="#fn10">10</a> the board deviated downward from the 
committee’s proposed three-year suspension and instead recommended respondent be 
suspended for one year and one day, with six months and one day deferred, 
followed by a one year supervised probation. Two board members dissented finding 
the proposed sanction to be unduly lenient.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Both the ODC and respondent filed an objection to the board’s findings and 
recommendation. As such, the matter was set on the court’s docket for oral 
argument pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(G)(1)(b). </p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. 
La. Const. art. V, § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an 
independent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has 
been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Quaid</i>, 94 1316 (La. 
11/30/94), <a href="#!-- #ID:646%20So.2d%20343 --#">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; 
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Boutall</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:597%20So.2d%20444 --#">597 So. 2d 444</a> 
(La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in any way by the findings and 
recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held 
the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee’s factual findings. 
See <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Caulfield</i>, 96 1401 (La. 11/25/96), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:683%20So.2d%20714 --#">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; 
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93 
2865 (La. 3/11/94), <a href="#!-- #ID:633%20So.2d%20150 --#">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on our review, we conclude the record supports the committee’s factual 
findings. The heart of respondent’s disciplinary violation was his commingling 
of client and third party funds in violation of Rule 1.15. While respondent’s 
decision to cash the settlement check and retain the funds may have been 
motivated by a desire to protect these funds from seizure by the IRS, there were 
alternatives available to him that would have protected the interests of all 
parties and would have allowed a timely disbursement of the funds to Ms. 
Bolinger and her healthcare providers. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Having found violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, we now turn to a 
determination of an appropriate sanction for this misconduct. The purpose of 
disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to 
maintain the appropriate standards of professional conduct, to preserve the 
integrity of the legal profession and to deter other lawyers from engaging in 
violations of the standards of the profession. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Vaughan</i>, 00 1892 (La. 
10/27/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:772%20So.2d%2087 --#">772 So. 2d 87</a></span>; 
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Lain</i>, 00 0148 (La. 5/26/00),

<a href="#!-- #ID:400%20So.2d%201355 --#">400 So. 2d 1355</a> (La. 1981)</span>. The discipline to 
be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the 
offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Redd</i>, 95 1472 (La. 9/15/95), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:660%20So.2d%20839 --#">660 So. 2d 839</a></span>;

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent’s misconduct created a strong potential of harm, because it exposed 
his client and the third party health care providers to the danger of losing 
their funds. His actions caused emotional and financial harm to his client. The 
baseline sanction for this misconduct is a suspension.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, we recognize respondent’s prior disciplinary record, 
substantial experience in the practice of law and the vulnerability of the 
victim. In mitigation, we find respondent sincerely believed he was acting in 
the best interest of his client. Additionally, the commingling of funds only 
lasted for a short length of the time. While restitution was not fully paid 
prior to the disciplinary complaint being filed, it was effectuated shortly 
thereafter. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering these factors, we conclude a one-year suspension, with six months 
deferred, subject to a one year period of supervised probation, is the 
appropriate penalty. </p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and 
disciplinary board, and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is 
ordered that Walter C. Dumas be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana 
for a period of one year. Six months of the suspension shall be deferred, and 
respondent shall be placed on probation for a period of one year, subject to the 
provision that any misconduct during this time will be grounds for making the 
deferred portion of the suspension executory or imposing additional discipline, 
as appropriate. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against 
respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal 
interest to commence thirty days from the date of the finality of this court’s 
judgment until paid. </p>
<hr noshade="" color="#000000" align="left" width="100" size="1">
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> According to Ms. Bolinger, the “shortly thereafter” was to indicate 
the funds were to clear after ten business days.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> There was $1,468.08 in respondent’s client trust account at the time of the 
levy, which lasted approximately twenty-one days, and respondent was unable to 
state how much of the seized funds were his own and how much were his clients. </p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> Apparently, respondent was concerned about the solvency of the insurance 
company which issued the settlement check. Ultimately, the check cleared.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> Specifically, the disbursement sheet indicated $4,150 in deductions ($992.50 
in attorney’s fees + $600 in cash advances + $2557.50 in medical expenses) from 
the $7,250 settlement award.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">5</a> The formal charges only cite a violation of Rule 1.15. However, the written 
allegations of misconduct describe conduct, with more specificity, in violation 
of sections (a) (failure to keep funds of a client or third party separate from 
attorney’s own funds) and (b) (failure to refund and account for client funds) 
of that provision. </p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn6">6</a> In <i>Pasquier</i>, we held “[a]lthough respondent’s motive in retaining funds for 
the protection of the purchasers was proper, this does not excuse him from 
complying with rules on managing these funds.”</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn7">7</a> Respondent has a prior disciplinary record consisting of two reprimands: File 
No. 7528-A (9/15/96) (incompetence, neglect and engaging in a conflict of 
interest) and File No. 7860-A (2/17/87) (withholding a fee in excess of that 
specified in an employment contract, failure to pay third party medical 
providers and failure to place disputed funds in trust).</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn8">8</a> Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in Louisiana in 1972 and, thus, 
had been practicing for 22 years at the time of the misconduct.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn9">9</a> Standard 4.12 provides “[s]uspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer 
knows or should know that he is dealing improperly with client property and 
causes injury or potential injury to a client.”</p>
