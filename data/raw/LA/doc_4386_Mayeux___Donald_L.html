<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: DONALD L. MAYEUX</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p>PER CURIAM<a href="#fn_">*</a><br>
VICTORY, J., dissenting<br>
KNOLL, J., dissenting</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from formal charges filed by 
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Donald L. Mayeux, 
an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana.</p>
<p align="center"><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The underlying facts are not disputed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In April 1992, Bernice Tyler retained 
respondent to represent her in a personal injury matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent personally guaranteed Ms. 
Tyler's medical expenses and advanced her monies for living expenses and medical 
tests during the course of the litigation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>The case proceeded to trial in 1994.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although respondent successfully 
obtained a judgment in favor of his client which totaled $42,483.89, including 
judicial interest, the amount of this judgment was not sufficient to cover 
respondent's attorney's fees and all of the costs and medical expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite this fact, respondent reduced 
his legal fee in order to give Ms. Tyler $2,000 from the proceeds of the 
judgment.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After obtaining the required endorsements on the settlement 
draft,<sup><a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> respondent deposited it into his collection 
account,<sup><a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> rather than his trust account, with the intent of 
attempting to negotiate a reduction in the medical expenses of the third-party 
medical providers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Over the next 
several months, it is undisputed that on several occasions, the balance of 
respondent's collection account dropped below the amount held for these 
third-party medical providers, and on at least one occasion dropped to 
zero.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By September 1994, respondent 
successfully negotiated a reduction in the medical expenses and fully paid all 
the third-party health care providers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>As a result of the reduction in the medical expenses, respondent was able 
to cover his attorney's fees, and he refunded an additional $300 to Ms. 
Tyler.</p>
<p align="center"><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In July 1997, Ms. Tyler filed a complaint with the ODC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In reviewing the documentation submitted 
by respondent in connection with the complaint, the ODC concluded that 
respondent improperly commingled and converted the funds he retained from the 
judgment to pay the third-party medical providers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ODC subsequently filed formal 
charges against respondent, alleging his conduct violated Rules <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.3"></a> (failure to act with diligence and 
promptness in representing a client), <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15"></a> (safekeeping property of a client or 
third person), <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4"></a>(a) (violation of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct), <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4"></a>(b) (commission of a criminal act 
reflecting adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a 
lawyer), and <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4"></a>(c) (engaging in conduct involving 
dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct. Respondent timely filed an answer to the formal charges, and the matter 
was set for a formal hearing before the hearing committee.</p>
<p align="center"><i><a href="#!-- ID:98-DB-067.HC --">Hearing 
Committee Recommendation</a></i></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">At the hearing, the ODC presented evidence showing that respondent 
commingled the Tyler settlement funds by placing them in his collection account, 
rather than his trust account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It 
further produced evidence that respondent converted the funds, because the 
balance in his collection account dropped below the amount of the retained funds 
on several occasions.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent testified on his own behalf and denied any 
misconduct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although he admitted 
that he deposited the settlement draft into his collection account, not into his 
trust account, he pointed out that he had personally guaranteed all of the 
medical expenses incurred by Ms. Tyler, and the balances owed to the medical 
providers were his personal obligation.<sup><a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Thus, respondent argued that 
this portion of the judgment did not represent funds belonging to a client or a 
third party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, he contended 
that because of the unique way his accounts were set up, the funds were never in 
any danger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He explained that the 
money in his collection account was actually linked to his money market account 
(known as a "Hi-Fi" account) and was additionally protected by a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>$10,000 line of 
credit.<sup><a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After considering the witness testimony and documentary evidence, the 
hearing committee concluded respondent "unintentionally" commingled 
client/third-party funds, thereby committing a "technical violation" of Rules <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15"></a> and <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4"></a>(a) of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the committee 
found there was no clear and convincing evidence that respondent converted or 
misappropriated the funds to his own use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>Additionally, the committee found there was no evidence to support a 
finding that respondent violated Rules <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.3"></a>, <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4"></a>(b), or <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4"></a>(c) of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Turning to the appropriate discipline for respondent's misconduct, the 
committee recognized as an aggravating factor that respondent has a prior 
disciplinary record.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, as a 
mitigating factor, it found there was no evidence of harm to respondent's client 
or to any third party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering 
all these factors, the committee recommended that respondent be publicly 
reprimanded and ordered to pay the costs of these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC objected to the recommended sanction as too lenient.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent objected and asked that the 
formal charges be dismissed.</p>
<p align="center"><i><a href="#!-- ID:98-DB-067.BD --">Disciplinary Board 
Recommendation</a></i></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board found the record supported the hearing committee's 
findings of fact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The board agreed 
that a commingling of funds occurred in violation of Rule <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15"></a> (a) <sup><a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> when respondent 
failed to place Ms. Tyler's settlement check in his trust account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the board rejected the charge 
of conversion, based on evidence of respondent's banking arrangements, 
specifically his "Hi-Fi" account and $10,000 line of credit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The board felt that no actual injury or 
harm resulted from his actions, and considering the banking arrangements, there 
was little, if any, potential for harm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>The board also concurred in the hearing committee's assessment of the 
aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As a sanction, the disciplinary board recommended that respondent receive 
a fully deferred three-month suspension, subject to six months of supervised 
probation with conditions.<sup><a class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> The board also recommended that 
respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Both respondent and the ODC filed objections in this court to the 
disciplinary board's recommendation, and the matter was set on the court's 
docket for oral argument pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r1911">11</a>(G)(1)(b).</p>
<p align="center"><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">It is well settled that a lawyer must deposit all funds of a client paid 
to him, other than advances for costs and expenses, in an identifiable client 
trust account. Rule <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15"></a> of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Louisiana State Bar 
Ass’n v. Krasnoff,</i> 488 So. 2d 1002 (La. 1986).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In the instant case, the record clearly demonstrates that respondent 
commingled funds in violation of Rule <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15"></a> of the Rules of Professional Conduct 
when he deposited Ms. Tyler's settlement check into his collection account, 
rather than his trust account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>Respondent attempts to argue these funds were his personal funds because 
he had personally guaranteed Ms. Tyler's medical expenses, and were not 
third-party funds because the medical providers at issue had not asserted a 
privilege on the judgment proceeds pursuant to La.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>R.S. 9:4751 <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">et seq.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i>We agree that, as a practical 
matter, the third-party providers may have looked solely to respondent for 
payment of the medical expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>Nevertheless, the fact remains that his client is legally liable for her 
medical expenses, regardless of respondent's guarantee or the absence of an 
assertion of a statutory privilege by the medical provider.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As such, the settlement check contained property of a client or third 
person, and under Rule <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15"></a>, respondent was bound to safeguard the 
funds separate from his own by placing them in his trust account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The lawyer's mistake, good faith, or 
lack of conscious wrongdoing does not negate an infraction of the rule, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Louisiana State</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bar Ass'n v. Hinrichs, </i>486 So. 
2d 116 (La. 1986), but bears only on the penalty to be imposed.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As to the conversion charge, it is undisputed that on several occasions, 
the balance of respondent's collection account dropped below the amount he 
withheld from the Tyler settlement to pay the medical providers, including at 
least one occasion when the balance of the account was zero.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent concedes these facts but 
argues that due to his banking arrangements, the funds were fully protected at 
all times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While we agree the funds 
may have never been in actual danger of loss due to the presence of respondent's 
line of credit and other accounts, there is no basis in the professional rules 
or in the jurisprudence for a finding that an attorney who has sufficient 
personal assets to cover client or third-party funds under this care is immune 
from a charge of conversion.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Turning to the issue of the appropriate sanction for respondent's 
misconduct, we are mindful that the purpose of lawyer disciplinary proceedings 
is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to maintain appropriate 
standards of professional conduct to safeguard the public, to preserve the 
integrity of the legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from engaging in 
violations of the standards of the profession. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Guidry, </i>571 
So. 2d 161 (La. 1990).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">We find there are significant mitigating factors present in this 
case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The record demonstrates that 
no actual harm resulted from respondent's misconduct, either to a client or to a 
third party, and respondent gained no personal benefit from his misconduct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, respondent refunded $2,000 of 
his attorney's fees to the client in order to give her some money from the short 
recovery, and refunded an additional S300 to her after successfully negotiating 
a reduction in the medical expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>Additional mitigating factors are the absence of a dishonest or selfish 
motive, cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings, character and 
reputation, and remorse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only 
significant aggravating factor present is respondent's prior discipline, 
<sup><a class="fn" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> which is unrelated to the conduct at issue.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering all these factors, we conclude a public reprimand is the 
appropriate sanction in this case.</p>
<p align="center"><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee 
and the disciplinary board, and considering the record, briefs, and oral 
argument, it is ordered that Donald L. Mayeux be publicly reprimanded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All costs and expenses in this matter 
are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r1910.1">10.1</a>, 
with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this 
court's judgment until paid.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">(FN1)</a> The settlement draft was payable to Ms. Tyler, 
respondent, and Haik &amp; Minvielle, the law firm which represented the 
hospital where Ms. Tyler received medical treatment following her accident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.legis.state.la.us/tsrs/tsrs.asp?lawbody=RS&title=9&section=4751">La. R.S. 9:4751</a> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">et seq</i>., the hospital asserted a 
privilege on the judgment proceeds in the sum of $1,490.58. To secure Haik &amp; 
Minvielle's endorsement on the settlement draft, respondent issued a check in 
that amount payable to the law firm.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">(FN2)</a> Respondent advances his clients' expenses from his 
collection account.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">(FN3)</a> Respondent submitted affidavits from several of Ms. 
Tyler's health care providers to the effect that each provider looked solely to 
respondent for payment of Ms. Tyler's medical expenses, and that had respondent 
not guaranteed her expenses, the provider would not have treated Ms. Tyler.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">(FN4)</a> In addition to the collection account previously 
discussed, respondent maintains three other checking accounts: a regular 
account, from which he disburses his office expenses; a trust account, for funds 
in which clients and third parties have an interest; and a "Hi-Fi" account, a 
money market investment account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As 
the balance increases in the collection account, idle funds are transferred to 
the "Hi-Fi" account in order to earn interest; as the balance decreases in the 
collection account, funds are transferred from the "Hi-Fi" account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Given the way the collection and "Hi-Fi" 
accounts function, respondent testified that he considered the accounts as 
one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent also has a $10,000 
line of credit connected to the collection account.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">(FN5)</a> The board also recognized that it was constrained to 
find a violation of Rule <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4"></a>(a), but concluded that finding "does 
not add anything to the case." The board felt that respondent's violations were 
“technical,” although it conceded that this assessment relates only to the 
sanction to be imposed.</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINE PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p>KNOLL, J., dissenting.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In this technical violation case, there were significant mitigating 
circumstances and no harm resulted to the client, the public, or the 
profession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While I agree with the 
majority's findings, in my view this case does not rise to the level 
necessitating the filing of formal charges, but should have been handled through 
the ODC by means of a diversionary program or a private reprimand, which would 
have been just as effective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This 
is the type of case that is recognized in the comments to the 1991 A.B.A. 
Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, Standards 1.2 (Public Nature of Lawyer 
Discipline), which provides in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">[I]t is important to note that there are certain 
situations in which it may be appropriate to impose private discipline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In cases of minor misconduct, when there 
is little or no injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the 
profession, and when there is little or no likelihood of repetition, the court 
or disciplinary counsel should consider imposing an admonition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A private sanction in such cases informs 
the lawyer that his or her actions are unethical, but does not unnecessarily 
stigmatize a lawyer from whom the public needs no protection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To deter other lawyers, the court can 
still issue a public report describing the facts in cases where admonitions are 
imposed, but omitting the names of the disciplined lawyers.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Our rules do not provide for a private discipline once formal charges 
have been filed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Supreme Court Rule 
XIX, § <a href="#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r1910">10</a>(A)(5).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You cannot "unring" the bell of a public 
discipline which bears harsh consequences to a respondent and should be reserved 
only for the well deserved cases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>In my view, this case demonstrates the need for our rules to be refined 
to include some means for this Court to issue a private discipline.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>
