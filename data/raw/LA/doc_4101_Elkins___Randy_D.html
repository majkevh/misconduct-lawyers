  <p class='headingstyle'>NO. 94-B-2070</p>

  <p class='headingstyle'>IN RE: RANDY ELKINS</p>

  <p class='headingstyle'>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class='signature'>PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"><span class="BodyText">On March 31, 1992, respondent, Randy Elkins, was convicted in federal
  court of three counts of willfully and knowingly making false statements to a bank for the purpose of influencing a
  loan decision in violation of</span> <span class="Style2">18 U. S. C. ' 10 14</span>.  On September 21, 1992, as a
  result of the conviction, this court suspended respondent from the practice of law on an interim basis.  Thereafter,
  respondent was formally charged with violation of Rules <span class="allegedrules">8.4(b)</span> and (c) of the
  Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The facts developed at the hearing indicated that respondent represented to Webster Bank &amp;
  Trust that he owned certain real property in order to obtain loans from the bank.  The property was actually owned by
  respondent's brother.  Although respondent timely repaid the loans, he was convicted of fraud as a result of the
  misrepresentations.  In addition, respondent's actions constituted "professional misconduct" under Rule 8.4 and the
  <a href="../HC/1994-02-28_92-DB-050.htm">hearing committee recommended</a> that respondent be suspended from the
  practice of law for a period of two years and six months, effective from the date of the interim suspension.  A
  harsher penalty was not suggested because of the existence of several mitigating circumstances, including
  respondent's exemplary candor to the committee and full restitution to the bank.  The disciplinary board subsequently
  adopted the recommendation of the hearing committee.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon <a href="../DB/1994-08-02_92-DB-050.htm">review of the record of the disciplinary board's
  findings and recommendations,</a> and the record filed herein, it is the decision of the court that the disciplinary
  board's recommendations be adopted.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, it is ordered that Randy Elkins be suspended from the practice of law for a period
  of two years and six months, said suspension effective from September 21, 1992.  All costs of this proceeding are
  assessed to respondent.</p>
