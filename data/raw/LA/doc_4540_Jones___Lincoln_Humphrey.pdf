<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 02-B-0982</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: LINCOLN H. JONES</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p><b>PER CURIAM</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This matter arises from reciprocal disciplinary proceedings filed by the Office 
of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, §21 against 
respondent, Lincoln H. Jones, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State 
of Louisiana and in the State of Kentucky. </p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">On October 1, 1997, respondent applied to sit for the February 1998 Kentucky Bar 
Examination. At that time, the Character and Fitness Committee of the Kentucky 
Board of Bar Examiners (“Committee”) expressed reservation over respondent’s 
outstanding student loan indebtedness. As a result, respondent and the Committee 
entered into a consent agreement which would allow respondent to be 
conditionally admitted to practice law in Kentucky once he passed the bar 
examination. Specifically, the agreement provided, in part, during the period of 
conditional admission, respondent would: “(a) submit proof of payment or, during 
periods of non-payment submit certification of compliance, on a monthly basis on 
the . . . loan; (b) provide proof of payment on [his] . . . loan for not less 
than 12 payments in amounts acceptable to the . . . Loan Program.”</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, respondent successfully passed the Kentucky Bar Examination and 
was conditionally admitted to practice law in that state. From May 31, 1998 to 
February 1, 1999, respondent mailed each month essentially identical letters to 
the Committee, each explaining that no payment was due since the current status 
of his loan was either “forbearance” or “in-school deferment” based on his 
understanding of the loan program’s regulations.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The Committee requested in writing that respondent provide an explanation for 
his failure to satisfy his monthly financial obligations, as well as provide 
evidence of his alleged in-school deferment. When respondent refused to produce 
the requested information, the Committee issued an order to show cause why 
respondent’s conditional admission should not be revoked. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, the Committee filed a motion with the Supreme Court of Kentucky 
seeking to revoke respondent’s law license based on his failure to comply with 
the terms and conditions of the conditional admission agreement. In response, 
respondent alleged that he complied with the terms of the consent agreement 
during its term, and was no longer subject to the agreement since the one year 
conditional period of admission had expired. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On December 20, 2001, the Supreme Court of Kentucky revoked respondent’s license 
to practice. The court found respondent violated Kentucky Supreme Court Rule 
3.3(a)(2) by failing to disclose a material fact to a tribunal (the Committee) 
when disclosure was necessary to avoid a fraud being perpetuated upon the 
tribunal. <span class="CITE"><i>Character and Fitness Committee v. Jones</i>, 62 S.W.3d 28 (Ky. 2001)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After the Kentucky disciplinary proceedings became final, the ODC filed a motion 
in this court to initiate reciprocal discipline pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 
XIX, §21. Attached to the motion were certified copies of the record developed 
in the Kentucky proceedings. By order dated April 5, 2002, we granted respondent 
and the ODC thirty days to inform the court “of any claim, predicated upon the 
grounds set forth in Supreme Court Rule XIX §21(D), that the imposition of 
identical discipline in Louisiana would be unwarranted and the reasons for that 
claim.” Respondent did not make any filing in response to that order.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the record, we find none of the factors which would warrant the 
imposition of different discipline under Supreme Court Rule XIX, §21(D)<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> are 
present in this case. As a result, the rule directs us to impose the “identical 
discipline” to that imposed by the Supreme Court of Kentucky. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Because the discipline adopted by Kentucky was revocation of respondent’s 
conditional right to practice, it is difficult for us to impose identical 
discipline in Louisiana. Under the facts, we conclude the closest form of 
discipline in this state is an indefinite suspension of respondent’s law 
license. In the event respondent is readmitted to practice in Kentucky, or can 
show any significant change in circumstance, he may petition for reinstatement 
in Louisiana pursuant to the provisions of Supreme Court Rule XIX, §21(E).</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">For the reasons assigned, it is ordered that respondent, Lincoln H. Jones, be 
suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana pending further order of this 
court. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in 
accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence 
thirty days from the date of the finality of this court’s judgment until paid. </p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">&nbsp;1</a> Supreme Court Rule XIX, §21(D) provides:<br>
<br>
Upon the expiration of thirty days from service of the notice pursuant to the 
provisions of paragraph B, the court shall impose the identical discipline 
imposed by the other state, unless disciplinary counsel or the lawyer 
demonstrates, or this court finds that it clearly appears upon the face of the 
record from which the discipline is predicated, that:<br>
<br>
(1) The procedure was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to 
constitute a deprivation of due process; or<br>
<br>
(2) There was such infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct as to give 
rise to the clear conviction that the court could not, consistent with its duty, 
accept as final the conclusion on that subject; or<br>
<br>
(3) The imposition of the same discipline by the court would result in grave 
injustice; or<br>
<br>
(4) The misconduct established warrants substantially different discipline in 
this state.<br>
<br>
If this court determines that any of those elements exists, this court shall 
enter such other order as it deems appropriate. The burden is on the party 
seeking different discipline in this jurisdiction to demonstrate that the 
imposition of the same discipline is not appropriate.</p>
