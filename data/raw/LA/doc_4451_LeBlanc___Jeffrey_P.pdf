<p style='text-indent:.5in'>The heirs of Harold Thomas Shealy

$27,373 in sale proceeds in an escrow account pending resolution of a dispute
among the heirs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The closing occurred
on May 30, 1997, and by November 1997, respondent’s escrow account had fallen
below the original sum necessary to pay all the heirs’ claims.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Through January 1, 1998, respondent’s escrow
account balance never exceeded $200 and from July 1997 forward, the balance in
his separate trust account did not exceed $3,500.<span style="mso-spacerun:

23, 1997, and paid three of the five siblings their respective pro rata shares
of $29,219.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The account should have
reflected a balance of $58,438, however, after respondent paid one of the
remaining siblings his portion, the account’s balance was $10,644.21, which was
insufficient to satisfy Mr. Brumfield’s share.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Subsequently, respondent obtained funds to satisfy the balance owed to
Mr. Brumfield.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On November 13, 1997, respondent

matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thereafter, respondent did not

consistently failed and refused to cooperate with its ongoing

notices of the complaints to respondent, however, he refused to accept the
certified mail or accepted it and refused to respond.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Additionally, respondent failed to honor the deposition subpoenas
which were personally served on him and did not appear at the scheduled
hearings.</p>



<p><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>

<p><i>Formal Charges</i></p>



<p style='text-indent:.5in'>After investigation, the ODC filed
a total of nine counts of formal charges against respondent alleging violations
of Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=RULE1.3'></a> (lack of diligence), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=RULE1.4'></a> (failure to communicate), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=RULE1.5'></a>
(failure to return unearned fees), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=RULE1.15'></a>
(commingling and conversion of client funds),<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=RULE8.1'></a>(c) and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=RULE8.4'></a>(g)
(failure to cooperate with the ODC), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=RULE8.4'></a>(b)
(commission of a criminal act adversely reflecting on a lawyer’s honesty,
trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=RULE8.4'></a>(c)
(engaging in conduct involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation)
of the Rules of Professional Conduct. </p>



<p style='text-indent:.5in'>Respondent did not file an
answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Accordingly, the hearing was
limited to documentary evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
ODC submitted evidence and a pre-hearing memorandum; respondent made no filing.</p>



<p><a target="hit" href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=hitlist&t=hitlist-frame.htm&tf=doc&tt=document-frame.htm&d=DR(header01054.htm)&h1=Title[,500]&ht=hitlist-j.htm&c=redirect&s=relevance-weight&a=Title&q=2001-0099'>Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></p>



<p style='text-indent:.5in'>After consideration of the
evidence, the hearing committee found respondent violated the Rules of
Professional Conduct as charged and that the ODC proved the formal charges by
clear and convincing evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
committee determined respondent’s conduct violated duties owed to his clients,
caused them actual injury, and reflected intentional misconduct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It also pointed out the record does not
support any mitigating factors. Noting respondent’s prior disciplinary record<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn3' href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>2</span></span></a>
and citing jurisprudence from this court, the committee recommended respondent
be disbarred and ordered to pay restitution.</p>



<p><a target="hit" href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=hitlist&t=hitlist-frame.htm&tf=doc&tt=document-frame.htm&d=DR(header00655.htm)&h1=Title[,500]&ht=hitlist-j.htm&c=redirect&s=relevance-weight&a=Title&q=2001-0099'>Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></p>



<p style='text-indent:.5in'>The disciplinary board concurred in
the hearing committee’s findings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It
found his conduct was intentional and caused actual injury to his clients. </p>



<p style='text-indent:.5in'>Like the committee, the board found
no evidence in support of any mitigating factors.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>However, it recognized several aggravating factors, including
prior disciplinary offenses, dishonest or selfish motive, a pattern of
misconduct, multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary
process by intentionally failing to comply with the rules or orders of the
disciplinary agency, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the
misconduct, vulnerability of the victims, and indifference to making restitution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Citing Standards 4.11 and 4.41 of the<i> </i>ABA’s
<i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> and jurisprudence from this
court, the board recommended respondent be disbarred from the practice of law
and ordered to pay restitution and/or return unearned fees to his clients.</p>



<p style='text-indent:.5in'>Neither respondent nor the ODC
filed an objection in this court to the recommendation of the disciplinary
board.</p>



<p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>



<p style='text-indent:.5in'>The record supports the findings of
the hearing committee that respondent violated the professional rules as charged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Therefore, the only issue to be addressed by
the court is the appropriateness of the proposed sanction.</p>



<p style='text-indent:.5in'>In making a determination of the
appropriate sanction, we are mindful that the purpose of lawyer disciplinary
proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to maintain
appropriate standards of professional conduct to safeguard the public, to
preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from
engaging in violations of the standards of the profession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Guidry</i>,
571 So. 2d 161 (La. 1990).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the
seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating
and mitigating circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Louisiana
State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>, 459 So. 2d 520 (La. 1984).</p>



<p style='text-indent:.5in'>Respondent’s misconduct is clearly
serious in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He deprived clients
of their funds for significant periods of time, neglected legal matters
entrusted to him, and failed to communicate with his clients.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We are unable to identify any mitigating
factors from the record.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, we
recognize the existence of numerous aggravating factors, including respondent’s
prior disciplinary history in this court and his substantial experience in the
practice of law (admitted 1981). Under these circumstances, we must conclude
respondent lacks the moral fitness to practice law in the State of
Louisiana.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Accordingly, we will accept
the disciplinary board’s recommendation and disbar respondent.</p>



<p><b>DECREE</b></p>



<p style='text-indent:.5in'>Upon review of the findings and
recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the record filed
herein, it is ordered that the name of Jeffrey P. LeBlanc be stricken from the
roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana
be revoked. Respondent is ordered to make full restitution to his victims.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All costs and expenses in the matter are
assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=r19s10.1'>10.1</a>, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the
date of finality of this court’s judgment until paid. </p>
