<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
September 1984, Cynthia Ratcliff retained the law firm of DuBarry and Boydell<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn2' href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[i]<![endif]></span></span></a>
to represent her in a wrongful death and survival action arising out of the
death of her husband.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The firm filed
suit on behalf of Mrs. Ratcliff and her two-year-old son in October 1984.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The case was set for trial in October 1985,
but during jury selection, the parties agreed to settle the matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The settlement consisted of an immediate
cash payment to Mrs. Ratcliff (the “cash portion”), in addition to a deferred
portion which was placed into an annuity (the “structured portion”) for the
benefit of herself and her son.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Because the
firm had not previously handled a settlement structured in this fashion,
respondent was unsure how to calculate the 40% contingency fee due the firm
under its agreement with Mrs. Ratcliff.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn3' href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[ii]<![endif]></span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, during settlement negotiations,
counsel for one of the defendants told respondent that the fee was properly
based upon the present-day value of the structured portion, and that an expert
qualified to compute present-day values, such as an economist, an actuary, or a
structured settlement broker, should be consulted.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Respondent did no heed this advice, but instead telephoned his
CPA to discuss the value of the settlement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The CPA advised respondent that without knowing either the applicable
interest rate or the cost of the annuity, he could only calculate a range of
present-day values based upon various interest rates.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Respondent selected a number in the middle of the range, $112,500,
upon which to calculate the attorney’s fees on the structured portion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Respondent asserts that Mrs. Ratcliff agreed
to this method of calculating the attorney’s fees, but she denied any such
agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nevertheless, what is clear
is that respondent did not consult an economist, an actuary, or a structured
settlement broker – either before or at any time after the settlement was
confected – to determine the actual value of the deferred payments.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Respondent
disbursed the settlement funds to Mrs. Ratcliff at a November 5, 1985
meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At that time, respondent
deducted attorney’s fees of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>$90,000 and
costs of $17,217.50 from the cash portion.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn4' href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[iii]<![endif]></span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He also deducted an additional $45,000 in
attorney’s fees which he charged on the structured portion, based upon his
representation that the annuity had a present-day value of $112,500.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, it was later revealed that the
actual cost of the annuity was only $49,465, and a 40% attorney’s fee on the
structured portion should have been less than $20,000.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There is
some question whether Mrs. Ratcliff expressed any reservations about
respondent’s calculations during the November 5, 1985 meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>According to Mrs. Ratcliff, she had not felt
comfortable with respondent during the representation and asked if she could
take some time to review his figures, particularly the calculation of the
attorney’s fees on the structured portion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Respondent accused her of not trusting him, and in tears, she ultimately
backed down and took the settlement check.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>By contrast, respondent testified that Mrs. Ratcliff never expressed any
concern about the attorney’s fees and “happily” left the November meeting with
a check for $72,782.50, her net share of the cash portion of the
settlement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The same day, the firm’s
share of the settlement was paid to respondent, Ms. DuBarry, and Barbara
Arnold, the associate who referred the case to the firm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mrs. Ratcliff deposited her check into her
checking account three days later.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>On November
21, 1985, Mrs. Ratcliff wrote to respondent, stating she was “unclear” on the
fee assessment and requesting “a written explanation of the calculations that
you sued to determine” the present-day value of the annuity, “or the name of
the financial expert who provided you with this value…” On November 22, 1985,
respondent sent a letter in reply, stating “[o]ur estimate of present day value
was based on information from both attorneys and accountants, all of whom were
quire familiar with structured settlements,” and indicating “[o]ur estimation
was as accurate as one can get, and you willingly accepted it.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Mrs.
Ratcliff subsequently retained a new attorney, Dawn Barrios, who sought to
obtain a refund from respondent of more than $25,000 in attorney’s fees charged
on the structured portion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In a January
29, 1986 letter to respondent, Ms. Barrios included a report from an economist,
Dr. Melville Wolfson, who estimated that the cost of Mrs. Ratcliff’s annuity
was $44,900. Based on Dr. Wolfson’s report, Ms. Barrios asked respondent “to
refund to my client, Cynthia Ratcliff, the difference between the attorney’s
fees retained on the structured settlement and those your firm is entitled to.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Faced with
this demand, respondent sent a March 12, 1986 letter directly to Mrs.
Ratcliff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He informed her that because
she had “decided to look ‘a gift-horse in the mouth’” by retaining new counsel,
the firm was billing her $14,244 for legal services performed incident to the
wrongful death suit.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn5' href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[iv]<![endif]></span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Respondent informed Mrs. Ratcliff that if
the firm did not receive prompt payment of the invoice, “we will return in kind
a suit against you to recover unpaid fees for services rendered.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>On June 23,
1986, Mrs. Ratcliff, through her attorney, Dawn Barrios, filed suit against
respondent, Ms. DuBarry, and the law firm to recover the disputed attorney’s
fees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Cynthia Ledet Ratcliff, et al.
v. Earl M. J. Boydell, Jr. and Deonne DuBarry d/b/a DuBarry &amp; Boydell, and
DuBarry &amp; Boydell, APLC,</i> No. 86-11313 c/w 86-15175, 86-19056, and
90-2303 on the docket of the Civil District Court for the Parish of
Orleans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Over the next several years,
respondent filed numerous reconventional demands, motions and other pleadings
against Ms. Barrios and Mrs. Ratcliff.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn6' href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[v]<![endif]></span></span></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Mrs.
Ratcliff ultimately prevailed in her suit, and on June 5, 1992, the district
court awarded her $25,214 in disputed attorney’s fees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most significantly, the district court also
awarded Mrs. Ratcliff sanctions against respondent and Ms. DuBarry in the
amount of $43,000 for abuse of process, $12,000 for unethical practices, fraud
and conversion, and $18,000 for intentional infliction of emotional
distress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In discussing the latter
claim, the district court stated:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:1.5in;text-align:justify'>Considering the
foregoing law in light of the facts of this case, the court finds that
plaintiff has sustained her burden of proving an intentional tort by defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is further felt that DuBarry and
Boydell’s vindictive, obstreperous, and dilatory tactics over the six-year
course of this litigation amounted to nothing short of extreme and outrageous
conduct against this plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
launched a counterattack against Ratcliff and Barrios by filing million dollar
defamation suits against plaintiff, her attorney, and her attorney’s
husband.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Over the course of this
self-protracted litigation, DuBarry and Boydell admittedly falsely sued
Ratcliff for additional attorneys’ fees not owed; they, without due diligence,
used a private process serve calculated to intentionally upset plaintiff by
serving her at home and work rather than through her attorney of record; they
obstinately refused to answer Ratcliff’s petition, in an attempt to wear her
down, for nearly three and on half (3 ½ ) years and then took a devolutive
appeal form a court order to answer; and they frivolously filed motions,
exceptions, third-party and reconventional demands (for many of which article
863 sanctions were awarded), devolutive appeals, unwarranted requests, to stay
proceedings, and other delaying requests to stay proceedings, and other
delaying requests too numerous to state.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:1.5in;text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">When one considers the fact that none of defendants’
counter-actions were found to be meritorious, or were based upon informed
advice of competent experts or counsel, such vile conduct is indeed so extreme
or outrageous as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded
as utterly intolerable in civilized community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The long history of intimidating tactics, multitudinous pleadings, and
unwarranted delays reveal a clear and convincing pattern of deliberate,
repeated harassment over a period in excess of six years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These extreme actions obviate any bona fide
legal privilege DuBarry and Boydell may have enjoyed…[T]he evidence is
uncontroverted that plaintiff was particularly susceptible to emotional
distress and that DuBarry had knowledge of such susceptibility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Furthermore, by his own admission, Earl
Boydell indicated that he intended to cause plaintiff some degree of
distress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When viewed in its totality,
this court finds that DuBarry and Boydell’s conduct amounted to more than a
lesser degree of fright, humiliation, embarrassment or worry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their conduct can only be classified as
extreme and outrageous conduct intended or calculated to cause Ratcliff severe
emotional distress.</p>

provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility, including DR <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=DR7-102'>7-102</a>(A) (engaging in harassing or malicious actions) and

fees on the structured portion of the tort settlement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because respondent’s firm had never handled
a structured settlement in the past, the committee pointed out that it was
incumbent upon respondent to seek competent assistance in determining how the

time the settlement funds were disbursed on November 5, 1985.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because respondent was unaware of a dispute

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
disciplinary board generally adopted the hearing committee’s report.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First, the board agreed that insufficient
evidence was presented to support a finding that Mrs. Ratcliff questioned the
calculation of respondent’s fee at the time of the settlement conference.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because respondent could not have been aware
of a fee dispute that day, he was not obligated to put the funds in trust.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Accordingly, the board concluded that
respondent did not violate DR <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=DR9-102'>9-102</a> and did not
commingle or convert client funds.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>However,
the board did note that when respondent received the economist’s report in
January 1986 which demonstrated that his fee was clearly improper, he was
obligated at that point to return the unearned portion of his fee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The board found that by failing to do so,
respondent violated DR <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=DR9-102'>9-102</a>(B)(4), which requires a
prompt return of client funds.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Turning to
the appropriate sanction for respondent’s misconduct, the board found that
respondent violated duties owed to his client, the public, and the legal
system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The board noted that
respondent’s actions were knowing and intentional, and caused a great amount
actual injury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In particular, the board
found that because respondent failed to return the unearned fee at issue for at
least eleven years, Mrs. Ratcliff had to endure years of litigation over the
fee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She was also made a defendant in
meritless, harassing lawsuits filed by respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The board determined that the only mitigating factor present is
no prior discipline.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The board
pointed out that it had been unable to find any prior case dealing with “such
egregious conduct.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At first glance,
however, the board felt that disbarment was appropriated under <i>Louisiana
State Bar Ass’n v. Hinrichs, </i>486 So. 2d 116 (La. 1986), given that
respondent clearly acted in bad faith, intended a result inconsistent with his
client’s interest, caused great expense and inconvenience to Mrs. Ratcliff, and
did to make restitution until a judgment was rendered against him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nevertheless, after considering the Office
of Disciplinary Counsel’s recommendation, the ABA’s <i>Standards for Imposing
Lawyer Sanctions, </i>and the mitigating factor of no prior discipline, the
board concluded that the three-year suspension recommended by the majority of
the hearing committee is appropriate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The Board also recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs
and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running
thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s judgment until paid.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The record
supports the findings of fact made by the majority of the hearing
committee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While there is conflicting
testimony regarding whether Mrs. Ratcliff questioned respondent’s fee
calculations at the November 5, 1985 meeting, the committee made a factual
finding that respondent was not aware there was a fee dispute at that
time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>We are unable to say this
factual finding is clearly wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Accordingly, we agree that respondent’s failure to segregate the
disputed portion of the fee at this time does not constitute commingling or
conversion in violation of DR 9-102.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Nonetheless,
the record reveals that by January, 1986, respondent received information form
an economist which clearly called his fee calculation into question and
indicated the fee he charged was higher that he was entitled to receive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At that point, respondent had an obligation
under DR <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=DR9-102'>9-102</a> (B)(4) to promptly refund the unearned
portion of the fee to his client.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

litigation over the fee.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Indeed, the

respondent against his former client.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

the district court concluded respondent’s actions “can only be classified as
extreme and outrageous conduct intended or calculated to cause Ratcliff severe
emotional distress.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The district
court’s findings in this regard are unquestionably supported by the voluminous
transcript of the district court proceedings which were introduced into the

attempts to justify his conduct in the underlying litigation on the ground that
he was acting in “self defense” in response to the aggressive tactics of his
opposing counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We find little
support for this defense in the record.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However, even assuming respondent was seeking to “defend his honor,” as
he suggests, the fact remains that he is subject to a professional obligation
to refrain from engaging in harassing or malicious litigation. Respondent’s
actions caused actual and substantial harm to his former client, as well as to
the legal system.</p>

determining the appropriate sanction for respondent’s misconduct, we are
mindful that the purpose of lawyer disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to
punish the lawyer, but rather to maintain appropriate standards of professional

profession, and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the standards
of the profession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Louisiana State
