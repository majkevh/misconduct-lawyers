<p class="HEADINGSTYLE"><a href="#dissent">LEMMON, J., Dissenting</a></p>
&nbsp;<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">This 
attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from formal charges instituted by the 
Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Hobart O. Pardue, an 
attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana. The charges 
primarily arise from respondent’s conviction for one count of willfully making 
and subscribing a false tax return.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn1"><font size="1">1</font></a></span></p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">On April 6, 1995, 
respondent pled guilty in the United States District Court for the Middle 
District of Louisiana to one count of willfully making and subscribing a false 
tax return in violation of
<a target="_blank" href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/7206.html">26 
U.S.C. § 7206</a>(1), a felony under federal law. The charge was based on 
respondent’s failure to report income of $213,348.30 and $182,904.89 for the 
years 1988 and 1989, respectively. The court sentenced respondent to a 
three-year period of probation with six months to be served in a halfway house, 
and fined him $20,000, together with back taxes and penalties.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">In an unrelated 
matter, respondent represented Patsy Tunnard and her minor son in a wrongful 
death suit instituted against the State of Louisiana. The ODC alleged that 
respondent contacted Thomas E. Aswell, a claims adjuster for the Office of Risk 
Management of the State of Louisiana, and attempted to negotiate a settlement of 
the pending lawsuit, without the knowledge or consent of Glenn P. Marcel, 
counsel for the State of Louisiana. Subsequently, respondent spoke with State 
Representative Juba Diez and advised him to contact Mr. Aswell in an effort to 
facilitate a settlement.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">After conducting 
an investigation, the ODC instituted formal charges against respondent. As to 
the tax matter, the ODC alleged that respondent engaged in a criminal act that 
adversely reflected on his honesty and moral fitness to practice law, in 
violation of Rule <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(b) of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn2"><font size="1">2</font></a></span> 
As to the Tunnard matter, the ODC alleged respondent improperly&nbsp; 
communicated with a party represented by counsel, in violation of Rule
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE4.2 --#">4.2</a> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn3"><font size="1">3</font></a></span></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Respondent filed 
an answer essentially denying any misconduct. A formal hearing was conducted and 
several parties, including respondent, testified. Respondent testified that he 
suffered two heart attacks in 1988, did not practice law for almost one year and 
had difficulty concentrating. In light of his medical condition, he filed his 
income tax returns “not caring whether the records were right or wrong.” He also 
asserted that rather than going through the full criminal process, he pled 
guilty so that he could spend more time with his wife, who had recently been 
diagnosed with cancer.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Respondent also 
presented the testimony of William Sykes, an accountant and former IRS agent. 
Mr. Sykes testified that it was the policy of the Criminal Investigation 
Division of the IRS that a person have at least three years of unstated income 
prior to prosecuting that person for criminal tax fraud. In the instant matter, 
he stated that the investigating agent examined respondent’s records from 1988, 
1989, and 1990 and found no substantial mistakes or errors in the 1990 return, 
suggesting the 1988 and 1989 returns were an aberration. Respondent’s 
cardiologist, Dr. Carl S. Luikart, testified respondent had suffered heart 
attacks in March, 1988 and August, 1988. He stated that the condition could have 
resulted in the respondent's lack of concentration, depression and confusion.&nbsp; 
When asked by disciplinary counsel whether the respondent’s lack of 
concentration could have affected his preparation of a complicated income tax 
return, Dr. Luikart testified it was “within the realm of reasonable 
possibility.” As to the Tunnard matter, respondent testified that he thought Mr. 
Aswell was an attorney, although he admitted he had never seen Mr. Aswell’s name 
on pleadings and he knew Mr. Marcel was handling the case. He stated he made the 
contact out of frustration because Mr. Marcel was “dragging his feet” on the 
case.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:95-DB-043.HC --#">Hearing Committee Report</a></h3>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">The hearing 
committee found respondent’s conviction for willfully making and subscribing a 
false tax return constituted a violation of Rule <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">
8.4</a>(d), in that he committed a criminal act that reflected adversely upon 
his honesty, trustworthiness and fitness. It concluded respondent’s failure to 
pay taxes was knowing and intentional and resulted in a loss to the public. With 
respect to the Tunnard matter, the committee found respondent’s direct contact 
with Mr. Aswell, and indirect contact through Representative Diez, constituted a 
violation of Rule <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE4.2 --#">4.2</a>. It reasoned such 
improper communication presented a potential for harm, since it circumvented the 
state’s legal counsel.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">In determining the 
appropriate sanction for respondent’s conduct, the committee recognized several 
aggravating factors: prior discipline,<span style="vertical-align: super"><font size="1"><a href="#fn4">4</a></font></span> 
multiple offenses, dishonest and selfish&nbsp; motives, substantial legal 
experience and refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of the conduct with 
respect to the Tunnard matter. In mitigation, it found that respondent 
acknowledged his guilt with respect to the income tax conviction, and did not 
cause any client injury. It also recognized in mitigation the health problems of 
respondent and his wife.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Based on these 
factors, the hearing committee recommended that respondent be suspended from 
practice for a period of three years, with all but one year and one day 
deferred, followed by a two year period of probation with conditions.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:95-DB-043.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Report</a></h3>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">The disciplinary 
board concurred in the factual findings of the hearing committee. Citing the 
American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Discipline, the 
disciplinary board recognized the baseline sanction for a violation of Rule 8.4 
was suspension and the baseline 5 sanction for a violation of Rule 4.2 was a 
reprimand. The board cited this court’s opinion in 6 <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar 
Ass’n v. O’Halloran</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:412%20So.2d%20523 --#">412 So. 2d 523</a> 
(La. 1982)</span>, for the proposition that respondent’s filing of a false tax return 
was an action involving moral turpitude, and noted this court had in the past 
imposed actual suspensions for misdemeanor failure to file tax returns.
<span class="CITE"> <i>In 
re: Huckaby</i>, 96-2643 (La. 5/20/97)</span>, <a href="#!-- #ID:694%20So.2d%20906 --#">
694 So. 2d 906</a>; <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Stout</i>, 97-0217 (La. 5/20/97),
<a href="#!-- #ID:694%20So.2d%20908 --#">694 So. 2d 908</a></span>. Based on these 
authorities, and considering the aggravating and mitigating factors, the 
disciplinary board recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of 
law for a period of two years.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Respondent filed 
an objection in this court to the disciplinary board’s recommendation, and the 
matter was set on our docket for oral argument, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 
XIX, § <a href="#!-- #ID:r19s11g --#">11</a>(G)(1)(b).</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Respondent’s 
conviction for willfully making and subscribing a false tax return in violation 
of <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/7206.html">26 U.S.C. § 7206</a>(1) 
is a serious crime for purposes of Rule <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a> of 
the Rules of Professional Conduct. As the disciplinary board found, the baseline 
sanction for such a violation is a suspension from the practice of law. After 
considering the aggravating and mitigating factors, the disciplinary board 
recommended respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of two 
years. Based upon our review of the record, we conclude this sanction is 
appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Upon review of the 
findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, and 
considering the record briefs and oral argument, it is ordered that respondent, 
Hobart O. Pardue, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of two 
years, commencing from the date of finality of this judgment. Respondent is 
assessed with all costs and expenses of this proceeding in accordance with 
Supreme Court Rule XIX, § <a href="#!-- #ID:r19s10.1 --#">10.1</a>.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn">*</a> Knoll, J. not on panel. Rule IV, Part II, §3.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> Respondent was also charged by the ODC with conduct 
prejudicial to the administration of justice and failure to cooperate. Both the 
hearing committee and the disciplinary board found the ODC presented 
insufficient evidence to support these charges, and the ODC does not object to 
this finding. Accordingly, these charges will not be addressed in our opinion.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="DISSENT"><dissent>DISSENT Lemmon, J.</dissent></a></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Respondent’s guilty plea to one count of willfully making and subscribing a 
false tax return under 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/7206.html">26 U.S.C. §7206</a>(1) is the primary basis upon which the 
majority
imposes a lengthy suspension this matter.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#dissent_fn1"><font size="1">1</font></a></span> I disagree with the severity of the 
penalty&nbsp; for several reasons.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">First, the tax offense to which respondent pleaded guilty is much less 
serious than that involved in <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. O’Halloran</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:412%20So.2d%20523 --#">412 So. 
2d 523</a> (La.
1982)</span>, cited by the Disciplinary Board.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#dissent_fn2"><font size="1">2</font></a></span> The
<i>O’Halloran</i> decision, in which this 
court&nbsp; imposed a three-year suspension, involved convictions of two counts for 
two
consecutive years of tax evasion, a much more serious crime that requires intent 
as an essential element, as well as one count for the same offense to which 
respondent pleaded guilty. In addition to the multiple offenses, two of which 
were much more serious than respondent’s single offense, the <i>O’Halloran</i> case 
also differs from the present case in that O’Halloran received a criminal 
sentence of actual imprisonment and never paid any of the taxes evaded or 
falsely underreported, whereas respondent received no jail time and paid all of 
the underreported taxes in full. Indeed, this case is closer factually to
<span class="CITE"> 
<i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Ponder</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:340%20So.2d%20143 --#">340 So. 2d 143</a> (La. 1976)</span>, in which an 
attorney was suspended for six months after conviction of two counts of the same 
offense to which respondent pleaded guilty.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Moreover, there was also evidence in the present case that tended to lessen 
respondent’s culpability for the offense. During the disciplinary hearing, 
respondent
introduced testimony of an expert in accounting, who was a former Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) agent and who represented respondent in the criminal case 
before the IRS. The accountant recommended the IRS District Counsel that the 
underreporting should be handled as a civil matter because it did not have the 
dishonesty feature usually found in such cases or any attempt to conceal 
wrongdoing.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#dissent_fn3"><font size="1">3</font></a></span> The accountant, explaining the underreporting as a mistake, 
recommended that “this case should be returned to the Examination Division for 
civil settlement and the assertion of a negligence penalty at most.” According 
to the uncontradicted testimony of the accountant at the disciplinary hearing,<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#dissent_fn4"><font size="1">4</font></a></span> 
all of the unreported income was deposited in the bank, and respondent 
mistakenly claimed certain expenses without reporting&nbsp; corresponding income. 
Thus the element of intent, which is an essential element of the more severe 
crime of tax evasion, was missing in this case (which was probably the  reason 
the government pursued the less serious offense).</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Given the nature of the underlying offense which was more in the nature of 
civil than criminal conduct, coupled with the serious health problems of both 
respondent and his wife, the federal judge, who is not known for light 
sentences, gave respondent no jail time. These same reasons prompted this court 
to deny the earlier request in this case to issue an interim suspension.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">While I agree with the majority that a two-year suspension is warranted for 
this type of offense, particularly considering respondent’s prior reprimand 
issued by this
court, the mitigating circumstances and the manner of commission of the 
underlying crime warrant a deferral of one of the two years of suspension, 
followed by a period of probation.</p>
<hr color="#000000" align="left" width="100" size="1">
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="dissent_fn1">1</a> As to the second charge of improperly communicating with a party 
represented by counsel, disciplinary counsel conceded at oral argument that “we 
would not be here” on this charge alone. Accordingly, I do not address the very 
troublesome question of whether an adjuster for a governmental agency is a 
“client” within the contemplation of Rule <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE4.2 --#">4.2</a>. However, I note that the Hearing 
Committee, which recommended a penalty less severe than that imposed by the 
majority considered multiple offenses as an aggravating factor.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="dissent_fn2">2</a> Respondent’s offense, however, was more serious than those in
<span class="CITE">
<i>In Re: Huckaby</i>, 96-2643 (La. 5/20/97); 
<a href="#!-- #ID:694%20So.2d%20906 --#">694 So. 2d 906</a></span>, and
<span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Stout</i>, 97-0217 (La. 
5/20/97); <a href="#!-- #ID:694%20So.2d%20908 --#">694 So. 2d 908</a></span>, which involved failure to file tax returns for which 
this court imposed penalties of one year, with six months deferred, and eighteen 
months, with six months deferred, respectively.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="dissent_fn3">3</a> Consideration of the nature of the underreporting, for the purpose of 
determining a lesser degree of culpability, does not constitute a retrial of the 
issue of guilt in violation of the rule that the certificate of conviction is 
conclusive evidence of guilt. The offense to which respondent pleaded guilty 
does not require criminal intent, and evidence of the lack of criminal intent 
truly goes to the degree of culpability rather than to the guilt of the charged 
offense.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="dissent_fn4">4</a> The accountant stated that the accused in most fraud 
cases does not deposit into the bank the money he or she does not report. </p>
