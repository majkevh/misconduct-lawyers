  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature"><span class="Author">PER CURIAM</span></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from one count of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Robert T. DeFrancesch, an attorney licensed to practice law in
  Louisiana but currently on interim suspension.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The underlying facts are not seriously disputed. In 1999, Nicole Wattigney retained respondent to
  represent her in a criminal matter stemming from a misdemeanor drug possession charge. Ms. Wattigney ultimately
  pleaded guilty to that charge. After the representation ended, respondent and Ms. Wattigney had sexual relations on
  several occasions over a period of four to six months, in exchange for which respondent provided financial assistance
  to Ms. Wattigney.<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 2001, Ms. Wattigney was arrested in Jefferson Parish and charged with felony drug possession.
  Respondent agreed to handle the matter for a fee of $2,000, which Ms. Wattigney paid in installments that were due
  weekly. After some negotiation with the Jefferson Parish District Attorney's Office, respondent arranged for Ms.
  Wattigney to participate in a pre-trial diversion program. However, Ms. Wattigney declined this opportunity and
  decided that she would prefer to plead guilty to the criminal charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On the morning of Monday, October 15, 2001, respondent appeared in court with Ms. Wattigney for a
  hearing in the criminal case. Ms. Wattigney did not make her fee installment payment that day, so respondent proposed
  that she accompany him to Mississippi for a sexual rendezvous as a "punishment" for failing to pay timely. Respondent
  told Ms. Wattigney to call him the next day, Tuesday, October 16, 2001, to confirm the details of the arrangement.
  Ms. Wattigney did not call respondent on Tuesday, but instead sought the advice of her parents regarding respondent's
  demands.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Ms. Wattigney's father contacted the ODC, and in turn, the ODC's staff investigator conducted a
  telephone interview of Ms. Wattigney and her father. Following the interview, the ODC proposed that it be allowed to
  tape record conversations between Ms. Wattigney and respondent. Ms. Wattigney agreed to allow the conversations to be
  tape recorded.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On Friday, October 19, 2001, the ODC's investigator initiated two conference calls between Ms.
  Wattigney and respondent. During both conversations, respondent explained to Ms. Wattigney that she would be required
  to have sex with him as a "punishment" for not paying her fee installments on time. Ms. Wattigney expressed
  reluctance to agree to respondent's demands, explaining that she had recently been engaged and was "trying to make
  everything right" with her fianc&eacute;. Respondent acknowledged that Ms. Wattigney might not be "enthused about doing it,"
  but analogized his demand for sex "as a penalty fee, like, [on a] Discover card." Respondent told Ms. Wattigney that
  once she took care of her "business," then "we'll be square and I'll be taking care of you again." When Ms. Wattigney
  continued to protest, respondent assured her that so long as she paid her fee installments on time each week
  thereafter, "this will never happen again, okay. But, if you miss, then that's the punishment, that's the late fee,
  that's the whatever you want to call it, okay." At the conclusion of the conversation on Friday, respondent
  instructed Ms. Wattigney to call him on Sunday night to make arrangements to "take care of business."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Ms. Wattigney did not speak with respondent again until Monday, October 22, 2001, at which time
  the ODC's investigator initiated and taped a third conversation between respondent and Ms. Wattigney. During this
  conversation, respondent withdrew his request that Ms. Wattigney have sex with him, suggesting there was "no sense
  aggravating everybody over this."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Following the October 22, 2001 conversation, respondent had no further contact with Ms. Wattigney
  until November 29, 2001. On that date, at Ms. Wattigney's request, respondent appeared in court when Ms. Wattigney
  entered a guilty plea in her criminal case.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a> There is no
  evidence in the record that respondent and Ms. Wattigney had sexual relations during the 2001 representation, nor
  that they ever discussed the "sex as punishment" issue any further.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent, alleging that his conduct violated
  the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.5(a)</span> (a
  lawyer's fee shall be reasonable), <span class="allegedrules">1.7(b)</span> (a lawyer shall not represent a client if
  the representation may be materially limited by the lawyer's own interests), <span class="allegedrules">1.8</span>
  (prohibited transactions between a lawyer and a client), <span class="allegedrules">2.1</span> (a lawyer shall
  exercise independent professional judgment in the representation of a client),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or
  misrepresentation), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the
  administration of justice). In his answer to the formal charges, respondent denied that his actions violated the
  Rules of Professional Conduct; alternatively, respondent expressed remorse for his conduct. The matter then proceeded
  to a formal hearing on the merits.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">At the hearing, the parties entered into stipulations and respondent admitted to the misconduct
  charged in the formal charges. The ODC called its staff investigator and Ms. Wattigney's father to testify in person
  before the committee, and introduced the tapes and transcripts of the three telephone conversations between
  respondent and Ms. Wattigney. Respondent testified on his own behalf and called Ms. Wattigney to testify. In her
  testimony, Ms. Wattigney stated that she was satisfied with the representation respondent provided in both of her
  criminal cases. She also explained that she no longer wished to pursue a complaint against respondent, whom she
  described as "a great guy" and "a friend of mine."<a name="fnref4" class="fn" href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2003-06-13_02-DB-067.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the committee made a finding of fact that an
  attorney-client relationship existed between respondent and Ms. Wattigney and that respondent attempted to coerce Ms.
  Wattigney to have sexual relations with him as a penalty for not paying legal fees to him on time. However, the
  committee determined that respondent subsequently dropped his demands for sexual relations with Ms. Wattigney. It
  also made a finding of fact that prior to the incident forming the basis of the instant charges, respondent had
  sexual relations with Ms. Wattigney on several occasions in exchange for financial assistance.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these factual determinations, the committee concluded that respondent violated the Rules
  of Professional Conduct as charged in the formal charges. Specifically, the committee found that respondent violated
  Rule <span class="Rules">1.5(a)</span> by attempting to coerce sex from Ms. Wattigney as a late payment fee.
  Respondent violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.7(b)</span> and <span class="Rules">1.8</span> by attempting to
  coerce Ms. Wattigney to have sexual relations with him during the legal representation, which created an inherent
  conflict of interest. Respondent failed to act as an independent advisor to his client, a violation of Rule
  <span class="Rules">2.1</span>, when he solicited Ms. Wattigney to have sex with him. Finally, respondent violated
  Rules <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> by
  his attempt to have sexual relations with Ms. Wattigney. Respondent used his position as an attorney to improperly
  require his client to have sex with him, and he attempted to take advantage of his client for his own sexual
  gratification.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee determined that respondent violated duties to the legal system and the profession,
  but concluded that he primarily violated his duties to his client, Ms. Wattigney. Respondent's conduct was clearly
  willful and intentional. Although respondent's misconduct caused neither economic loss to Ms. Wattigney nor a loss of
  freedom, his conduct was emotionally troubling to Ms. Wattigney and to her family, and had the potential to cause
  serious injury to Ms. Wattigney. Relying on the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions as well as this court's
  opinions in In re: Ashy, 98-0662 (La. 12/1/98), <a href="1998-12-01_1998-0662.htm">721 So. 2d 859</a>, and In re:
  Gore, 99-3213 (La. 1/28/00), <a href="2000-01-28_1999-3213.htm">752 So. 2d 853</a>, the committee determined that the
  baseline sanction for respondent's conduct is a two-year suspension from the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The only aggravating factor recognized by the committee is respondent's
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span> (admitted 1976). The committee found
  the following mitigating factors are present: <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary
  record</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>, and a <span class="ABAstandard">cooperative attitude toward
  the proceedings</span>. Finding the mitigating factors outweigh the lone aggravating factor, the committee concluded
  that deferral of at least half of the baseline sanction is warranted. Accordingly, the committee recommended that
  respondent be suspended for two years, with all but one year deferred, conditioned upon a two-year period of
  probation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed an objection to the leniency of the sanction recommended by the hearing committee.
  Respondent did not object to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-01-30_02-DB-067.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board concurred in the hearing committee's factual findings and application of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct. The board found that respondent intentionally violated duties owed to his client
  and as a professional when he attempted to coerce his client into a sexual act as a penalty for failing to pay a
  weekly installment on a legal fee. Respondent's conduct did not cause tangible harm to the client, but resulted in
  emotional distress to her family.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board found the record supports the aggravating factors of
  <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span> and substantial experience in the practice of law. In
  mitigation, the board recognized respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Turning to the issue of an appropriate sanction, the board examined the Ashy and Gore cases. The
  board observed that Ashy is factually similar to the instant matter. The respondent in Ashy made unwanted sexual
  advances to his client in exchange for his legal services on her behalf in an alleged drug matter. He also gave her
  $200 to buy lingerie and a dress to wear to his office. In exchange for an ongoing sexual relationship, Ashy promised
  his client that he would make a drug investigation involving her go away; however, Ashy knew that his client was not
  actually the subject of an investigation. Before a sexual encounter occurred, Ashy called off his demand for a sexual
  relationship. This court suspended Ashy for two years.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Gore involved a consent discipline stemming from a consensual sexual relationship. Gore was
  suspended for six months with two years of supervised probation for engaging in a consensual sexual relationship
  during his representation of a client in a divorce proceeding and for failing to advise his client of the potential
  conflict of interest. This court distinguished Gore's conduct from Ashy's conduct, noting that Gore involved
  consensual sex as opposed to coerced sex in Ashy.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering these cases, the board concluded that respondent's conduct falls between that found
  in Ashy and in Gore. While respondent attempted to coerce Ms. Wattigney into a sexual relationship, he did not
  fabricate a story of a drug investigation like Ashy did. Nevertheless, the board felt that the gravity of
  respondent's misconduct warranted his having to apply for reinstatement to the practice of law. Accordingly, the
  board recommended that respondent be suspended for two years and one day, with one year deferred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">One board member dissented, on the ground that the sanction recommended by the disciplinary board
  is too severe.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Both respondent and the ODC filed objections to the disciplinary board's recommendation.
  Accordingly, the case was docketed for oral argument pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(G)(1)(b).</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316
  (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in
  any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the
  manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings. See <span class="cite">In re: Caulfield,
  96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class="cite">In re:
  Pardue, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The instant case is unique because the conversations between respondent and Ms. Wattigney upon
  which the formal charges are based were tape recorded. These tapes were introduced into evidence and respondent
  stipulated to their authenticity. We have reviewed the tapes and other evidence in the record and conclude they
  demonstrate the ODC proved the formal charges against respondent by clear and convincing evidence. Accordingly, the
  sole issue presented for our consideration in this case is the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In considering that issue, we are mindful that the purpose of lawyer disciplinary proceedings is
  not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to maintain appropriate standards of professional conduct to safeguard
  the public, to preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations
  of the standards of the profession. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Guidry,
  <a href="1990-12-03_1988-0829.htm">571 So. 2d 161</a> (La. 1990)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In determining the seriousness of respondent's offense, we find it helpful to review the prior
  jurisprudence of this court involving similar misconduct. As the disciplinary board recognized, the facts of
  <span class="cite">In re: Ashy, 98-0662 (La. 12/1/98), <a href="1998-12-01_1998-0662.htm">721 So. 2d 859</a></span>, and 
  <span class="cite">In
  re: Gore, 99-3213 (La. 1/28/00), <a href="2000-01-28_1999-3213.htm">752 So. 2d 853</a></span>, present the closest
  similarities to the instant case.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In Ashy, the lawyer falsely advised his female client that she might be the subject of a criminal
  investigation. During a meeting with the client, the lawyer told her that she was "very attractive," asked if she
  "minded" if he "hit on her," and kissed her without her consent. At a later meeting, the lawyer told the client that
  he wanted to have a sexual relationship with her. He kissed her, touched her breast and buttocks, and placed her hand
  on his crotch. He also gave her some money to buy lingerie and a dress to wear to his office. He told the client that
  if she did not sleep with him he would do what he could to help her, but he couldn't guarantee results; however, if
  she did sleep with him, "everything would disappear." The client eventually learned that no warrant was going to be
  issued for her arrest and filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">We determined the lawyer's conduct violated Rule 2.1, because his sexual overtures to his client
  threatened his ability to exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice. Likewise, we
  identified a violation of the conflict of interest provisions in Rule 1.7(b), as the lawyer placed his own interests
  ahead of his client's interests by refusing to put forth his best efforts unless the client responded to him
  sexually. After conducting a detailed analysis of Louisiana jurisprudence as well as the cases of our sister states,
  we noted that courts have imposed a wide range of discipline in similar cases of sexual misconduct, ranging from
  public reprimands to disbarment. We concluded the appropriate sanction for the lawyer's misconduct in Ashy was a
  two-year suspension.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In Gore, the lawyer entered into a consensual sexual relationship with a female client whom he
  subsequently represented in a divorce proceeding. Although the client desired the divorce (which was uncontested by
  her husband) and consented to respondent's representation, the lawyer admitted that he failed to discuss with his
  client the conflict of interest presented by their relationship. We accepted a petition for consent discipline and
  imposed a six-month suspension, followed by a two-year period of probation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Although respondent's misconduct is not identical to the misconduct at issue in either Ashy or
  Gore, those cases provide us with some guidance. As in Gore, respondent and Ms. Wattigney had a prior consensual
  sexual relationship, although this relationship had terminated by the time of the instant misconduct. As in Ashy,
  there is an element of coercion in respondent's implied threat that he might cease to represent Ms. Wattigney if she
  did not submit to the "sex as a penalty" arrangement; however, unlike Ashy, respondent never threatened to limit his
  efforts on his client's behalf if she refused to engage in a sexual relationship with him. Indeed, respondent
  correctly points out he ultimately withdrew his request for sex and continued to represent Ms. Wattigney in her
  criminal case until it was concluded to her satisfaction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Nonetheless, as we observed in Ashy, the particular evil that results from a lawyer's sexual
  relationship with a client is the loss of emotional detachment which in turn threatens the objectivity and
  reasonableness that form the basis of the lawyer's independent professional judgment. Ashy, 98-0662 at p. 15,
  <a href="1998-12-01_1998-0662.htm">721 So. 2d at 867</a> (quoting Annotations to Model Rule 2.1). The potential for
  harm which results whenever a lawyer allows his personal interests to conflict with his client's interests is so
  great that any such violation must be viewed as being very serious, even if actual harm is not readily identifiable.
  The baseline sanction for this misconduct is a suspension from the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, we recognize respondent's dishonest or selfish motive and substantial
  experience in the practice of law. In mitigation, we recognize the absence of a prior disciplinary record,
  respondent's cooperative attitude toward the proceedings, and remorse.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the facts of this case, we find the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct
  is a two-year suspension from the practice of law. However, in light of the mitigating factors, we will defer all but
  one year and one day of the suspension. This will necessitate respondent's application for reinstatement under
  Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24 and thus permit this court to determine whether he has sufficient integrity to return to
  the practice of law.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is ordered that Robert T. DeFrancesch, Louisiana Bar Roll
  number 4802, be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of two years, with all but one year and
  one day deferred. This suspension shall be retroactive to February 4, 2004, the date of respondent's interim
  suspension. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court
  Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment
  until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> Respondent and the ODC filed a joint
  motion for interim suspension pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 19.3, based on respondent's conduct in the
  instant case. We granted that motion on February 4, 2004. <span class="cite">In re: DeFrancesch, 04-0245 (La.
  2/4/04), <a href="2004-02-04_2004-0245.htm">865 So. 2d 693.</a></span></p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">2</a> The extent of the financial assistance
  is unclear. Respondent testified that he gave Ms. Wattigney a total of three or four hundred dollars during the
  relationship, in response to Ms. Wattigney's requests for help paying her utilities and other living expenses. Ms.
  Wattigney, on the other hand, testified that respondent gave her several hundred dollars each time they had sex
  because "I was having problems with my boyfriend and I needed money, and he had it, so I just set a price and it was
  okay."</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3" id="fn3">3</a> The trial court sentenced Ms.

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4" class="fn" href="#fnref4" id="fn4">4</a> Respondent asserts that in light of
  Ms. Wattigney's testimony, the ODC should not have pursued the matter further. However, Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
  18(H) plainly provides that "[n]either unwillingness nor neglect of the complainant to sign a complaint or prosecute
  a charge . . . shall, in itself, justify abatement of the processing of any complaint."</p>

    <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

    <p class="signature"><span class="Author">WEIMER, J., dissenting.</span></p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">I agree the respondent should be sanctioned, but dissent regarding the severity of the sanction
    imposed by the majority.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">In this matter, one day makes a difference because the respondent must re-apply for admission
    to the bar if the suspension exceeds one year. This makes the sanction too harsh. I cannot and do not condone his
    behavior which was wrong and unconscionable. The respondent has acknowledged this.<a name="fnref1dis" class="fn"
    href="#fn1dis" id="fnref1dis">1</a> However, the parties had engaged in consensual sexual relations previously.
    Additionally, the fact of the matter is the respondent called off this suggested encounter.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">I suggest the respondent made a terrible error of judgment from which he withdrew before the
    suggested rendevous occurred. Disciplinary board member, Billy R. Pesnell, dissented and assigned reasons,
    stating:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The facts found by the Hearing Committee, and affirmed by the Board, show that the Complainant agreed to have
      sexual relations with Respondent as a "late fee" or "penalty," at Respondent's suggestion, on October 19, 2001.
      Respondent's suggestion (or demand) was voluntarily <b>dropped</b> by <b>Respondent</b> three days later on
      October 22, 2001, without any <b>sexual relations having occurred</b>. Thus, Respondent did not in fact use his
      position as attorney to coerce sex or money from Complainant. The evidence does not show that Respondent received
      an "unreasonable fee" in violation of Rule 1.5 or consummated a business transaction in violation of Rule
      1.8.</p>

      <p>Moreover, it is clear from the Board's findings that Respondent and the Complainant had <b>consensual</b>
      sexual relations on several occasions <b>before</b> the attorney-client relationship on which the disciplinary
      charges are based was established. The Board, however, ignores that material in its analysis. It has been widely
      recognized that "... the principal danger of conflict in sexual relationships is pressure applied against a
      vulnerable client; <span class="u">that risk is plainly lower where the relationship is a preexisting
      one.</span>" (Emphasis added.) Hazard &amp; Hodes, 1 The Law of Lawyering, (3 ed. 2003), § 11.18, Note 3, pp.
      11-75. There was a pre-existing relationship here. In addition, the Hearing Committee expressly refused to find
      that the Complainant was vulnerable. The Board does not find that the Hearing Committee's conclusion in this
      respect is manifestly erroneous.</p>

      <p>Finally, neither the Hearing Committee or the Board has made any finding, nor is there any suggestion by ODC,
      that the quality of the professional services provided by Respondent in handling the Complainant's case was
      impaired by the potential conflict or was sub-standard in any way. See People v. Zeilinger, 814 P.2d 808 (Colo.
      1991). ... While Respondent's suggestion that the Complainant should pay a "penalty" or "late fee" in the form of
      sex is undoubtedly reprehensible, it was not dishonest. Nor is there any proof that Respondent's misconduct
      prejudiced the administration of justice in any way. There is no evidence that Respondent delayed the disposition
      of the case or threatened to limit his legal services in order to coerce Complainant's consent to a sexual
      relationship. Consequently, I do not believe there is any basis for the Board's conclusions that Respondent
      violated Rule 8.4(c) and Rule 8.4(d). Certainly, ODC has not established these alleged violations with clear and
      convincing clarity. [All emphasis in original; internal footnotes omitted.]</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Pesnell concluded that respondent's primary rule violations involve rules 1.7(b) (conflict
    of interest) and 2.1 (independent advisor). These violations lasted for a total of four days from the day
    respondent first suggested sex as a late fee until the day he voluntarily dropped his demands. While the potential
    conflict and breach of fiduciary duty threatened harm to both the complainant and the legal system, there is no
    proof that any actual harm resulted from respondent's overtures, outside of the emotional trauma and indignity
    suffered by the complainant.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">Any trauma to the complainant in this case is mitigated by the fact the parties had previously
    had consensual sexual relations and by the fact she considered the respondent a "friend" and wanted to drop the
    charges. When asked by the commission why she wanted to drop the charges, the complainant replied:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Well, the fact I'm, he's a great guy, you know. We were friends before. I don't want this to happen to him.
      It's his livelihood and, you know he's a friend of mine. I was nervous and scared at the time. I just want to
      drop the charges because I feel like, you, it's over with, what was said was said, and I wouldn't want this to go
      further.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="Bodycopy">The punishment suggested by the Hearing Committee, which had the advantage of seeing the
    attorney and the complainant testify, would adequately serve the ends of justice. The committee found the following
    undisputed mitigating factors present: absence of a prior disciplinary record, remorse, and a cooperative attitude
    toward the proceedings. The committee recommended that respondent be suspended for two years with all but one year
    deferred, conditioned upon a two-year period of probation.  I agree with the recommendation of the Hearing
    Committee.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1dis" class="fn" href="#fnref1dis" id="fn1dis">1</a> Respondent explained:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p class="footnotetext">The remorse is total and complete. Nothing-you can hurt me in ways that-you can punish
      me, punish me for what I did in other ways, but I really don't believe you all can punish me more than I've
      punished myself over the last years over the stupidity. There's no excuse for it. . . . I'm hoping after this is
      over I can tell Nicole how sorry I am too, that this ever happened. The remorse is totally complete. . . .
      Nothing like this has ever happened, it will never happen again, and it was a combination of circumstances that
      came together and I reacted totally inappropriately to those situations and circumstances, and I apologize to the
      committee and to the other members of the Bar for having you all here today.</p>
