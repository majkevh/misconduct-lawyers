<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>NO. 01-B-2930</p>

<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>IN RE: FELICIA NICOLE GRAHAM</p>

<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">
This disciplinary proceeding arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Felicia Nicole Graham, an 
attorney
licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<h3>98-DB-050</h3>
<h4>Count I</h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">In June 1995, 
Erica Williams retained respondent to handle her divorce. She paid respondent a 
$100 retainer, plus $200 for filing fees. On May 16, 1996, respondent filed the 
petition for divorce on behalf of her client. Thereafter, respondent performed 
no further work in the case, and did not communicate with her client. As a 
result, Ms. Williams filed a complaint with the ODC.</p>
<h4>Count II</h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC sent 
notice of Ms. Williams’ complaint to respondent. She failed to respond. The ODC 
then served respondent with a subpoena ordering her to appear in order to make a 
sworn statement. Respondent failed to appear pursuant to the subpoena.</p>
<h3>99-DB-056</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Jeffrey S. 
Brumfield retained respondent to represent him in connection with a personal 
injury case. The case eventually settled, and the settlement funds were 
disbursed in July 1998. Respondent withheld $667.90 from the settlement proceeds 
to pay a third-party health care provider, but failed to pay the provider until 
January 1999, causing her client to be subjected to numerous collection 
attempts. </p>
<h3>00-DB-007</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In June 1999, 
Willie Turner contacted respondent for the purpose of having her assume his 
representation in a civil suit that had been filed on his behalf by another 
attorney. Mr. Turner had his case file sent to respondent. Thereafter, he was 
unable to contact respondent, and he ultimately filed a complaint with the ODC. 
The ODC sent notice of this complaint to respondent, but she failed to reply. It 
then issued a subpoena compelling her to appear and give a sworn statement.&nbsp; 
Respondent failed to appear pursuant to the subpoena.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After 
investigation, the ODC filed formal charges against respondent, alleging several 
violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In 98-DB-050, the 
ODC alleged that in connection with her representation of Ms. Williams, 
respondent violated Rule 1.3, by failing to act with reasonable diligence and 
promptness, and Rule <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.4 --#">1.4</a>, by failing to keep 
her client reasonably informed about the status of a matter. The ODC further 
alleged respondent violated Rules <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.1 --#">8.1</a>(c) and
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(g) when she failed to cooperate with the 
ODC in its investigation of this matter.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In 99-DB-056, the 
ODC alleged that respondent violated Rule <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.15 --#">1.15</a>(b) 
by failing to promptly deliver funds to a third-party health care provider. In 
00-DB-007, the ODC alleged respondent again violated Rules
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.1 --#">8.1</a>(c) and <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(g) 
by failing to cooperate in the disciplinary investigation of the Turner 
complaint.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent did not 
file an answer in 98-DB-050 or 99-DB-056.<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> 
Respondent&nbsp; filed an answer in 00-DB-007, contending she was suffering 
personal problems at the time of the investigation of the Turner complaint, and 
therefore was unable to respond to the complaint or subpoena. In light of 
respondent’s answer, a formal hearing was scheduled on these charges.</p>
<h3>Recommendations of the Hearing Committees<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#!-- ID:98-DB-050.HC --">98-DB-050</a></h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">Because respondent 
failed to file an answer, the hearing committee found the charges against her in 
this matter were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence, by 
operation of Supreme Court Rule XIX, §11(E)(3). In imposing discipline, the 
committee recognized that the ODC suggested a public reprimand would be an 
appropriate sanction. However, the committee was disturbed by what it perceived 
to be contempt for the disciplinary process demonstrated by respondent. It 
reasoned that in light of this conduct, it was unlikely that a public reprimand 
would have any effect on her. Therefore, the committee recommended that 
respondent be suspended for one year and one day (which would necessitate an 
application for reinstatement) and further recommended she be ordered to return 
the full amount of the retainer to Ms. Williams.</p>
<h4><a href="#!-- ID:99-DB-056.HC --">99-DB-056</a></h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent did not 
appear at the formal hearing in this matter. The ODC presented Mr. Brumfield as 
a witness. Mr. Brumfield testified that he received collection notices for his 
medical bill. When he informed respondent, she advised him it must be a mistake 
and that the medical bill was “taken care of.” Mr. Brumfield testified he 
continued to receive notices and again contacted respondent. At that time, 
respondent advised him she was looking into the matter. However, respondent did 
not pay the bill until after Mr. Brumfield sent her a certified letter on 
January 18, 1999.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The committee 
concluded Mr. Brumfield was very credible, and found his testimony established 
that respondent did not promptly deliver the funds to the third-party health 
care provider, in violation of Rule <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.15 --#">1.15</a>(b). 
In imposing discipline, the committee took notice of the recommendation of the 
hearing committee in 98-DB-050. As in that proceeding, the committee noted 
respondent’s failure to participate and concluded respondent placed “little 
value on her license to practice law.” Therefore, the committee recommended 
respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year and 
one day, with the suspension running concurrently with the suspension in 
98-DB-050.</p>
<h4><a href="#!-- ID:00-DB-007.HC --">00-DB-007</a></h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">The committee 
conducted a formal hearing in this matter, and respondent appeared at the 
hearing. Respondent stipulated that she violated the professional rules as 
charged by failing to respond to the ODC’s subpoena. In mitigation, respondent 
testified that she misunderstood the subpoena as only requesting production of 
documents, rather than a personal appearance. Respondent also stated she was 
suffering from personal and medical problems during that time. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In determining an 
appropriate sanction, the committee concluded the baseline discipline for 
respondent’s misconduct in this matter is a reprimand. As aggravating factors, 
the committee found prior disciplinary offenses, a pattern of misconduct, and 
multiple offenses, based on the charges in 98-DB-050 and 99-DB-056. It found no 
mitigating factors, observing there was no evidentiary support for respondent’s 
argument that her personal and medical problems prevented her from responding to 
the ODC’s requests.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As a sanction, the 
committee recommended respondent be suspended for a period of eighteen months, 
with the suspension running concurrently with those recommended by the other 
hearing committees. The committee also recommended the somewhat unusual 
condition that respondent be required to attend four separate disciplinary 
hearings in order to impress upon her the seriousness of the disciplinary 
process.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-007.BD --#">Disciplinary Board 
Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary 
board considered all three charges together and issued a single recommendation,<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> 
finding the record supports the hearing committees’ conclusions that respondent 
violated the ethical rules as charged. In determining the appropriateness of the 
sanction, the board looked to the four factors set forth in 
<span class="AllRules">Supreme Court Rule 
XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s10 --#">10</a>(C)</span>.<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> 
The board found respondent violated duties to her clients and the legal system. 
It determined that her actions were knowing and intentional, and caused actual 
harm to her clients. In particular, it noted Mr. Brumfield was harmed because 
respondent’s failure to pay the medical bill was reported to a credit agency, 
resulting in his receiving a negative credit rating. The board also observed 
respondent’s failure to cooperate in the disciplinary investigation burdened the 
disciplinary system as a whole.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Citing the ABA’s 
Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the board found the baseline sanction 
for respondent’s misconduct is a suspension.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn5"><font size="1">5</font></a></span> 
It also cited jurisprudence from this court in which suspensions were imposed 
under similar facts.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn6"><font size="1">6</font></a></span></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating 
factors, the board recognized a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, and 
bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn7"><font size="1">7</font></a></span> 
It found no mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering all 
three matters together, the board recommended respondent be suspended from the 
practice of law for a period of one year and one day. It also recommended 
respondent be required to obtain five extra continuing legal education hours in 
ethics during the period of her suspension, and attend the Louisiana State Bar 
Association’s Ethics School.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn8"><font size="1">8</font></a></span>
</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent 
nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the disciplinary board’s 
recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record supports the determinations of the hearing committees that the 
formal charges against respondent were proven by clear and convincing evidence. 
Therefore, the sole issue presented for our consideration is the appropriate 
sanction for respondent’s misconduct. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary 
proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the 
public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct.

<a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The 
discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness 
of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Clearly, the aspect of respondent’s conduct which most disturbed all three 
hearing committees in this case was her failure to cooperate in the disciplinary 
investigations. As this court observed in <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Jones</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:555%20So.2d%201375 --#">555 So. 2d 1375</a>, 1380 (La. 1990)</span>, 
“failure to cooperate in the investigation of alleged misconduct not only 
prejudices the administration of justice, but also prejudices the attorney’s 
position, inasmuch as many complaints are handled at the investigatory phase 
without formal proceedings.” This statement is particularly applicable to the 
instant case, where the complaints against respondent were relatively minor in 
nature and could have been quickly resolved if she had simply complied with her 
professional obligation to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation. Under 
these circumstances, a period of suspension is necessary to impress upon 
respondent the need to fulfill her duties under the Rules of Professional 
Conduct, both to her clients and to the disciplinary system.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, we recognize a pattern of misconduct, multiple 
offenses, and bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding. We are 
unable to discern any mitigating factors from the record.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">We conclude that a suspension from the practice of law for a period of one 
year and one day, together with the requirement that respondent take five 
additional continuing legal education hours in ethics and attend ethics school 
during her suspension, will adequately serve to protect the public, the legal 
system, and the profession.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committees and 
the disciplinary board, and considering the record filed herein, it is ordered 
that Felicia Nicole Graham be suspended from the practice of law in the State of 
Louisiana for a period of one year and one day. It is further ordered that 
during her suspension, respondent obtain five additional hours of continuing 
legal education in the area of ethics and attend the Louisiana State Bar 
Association’s ethics school. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed 
against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal 
interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s 
judgment until paid.</p>
<hr noshade color="#000000" align="left" width="100" size="0">
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> After the time for answering had expired, respondent 
filed a letter addressing the charges in 99-DB-056. As a result, the hearing 
committee recalled the order deeming the charges admitted and scheduled a formal 
hearing. However, respondent failed to attend the hearing.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> The charges in this matter were considered by three 
separate hearing committees.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> 98-DB-050 and 99-DB-056 were initially consolidated 
before the disciplinary board, which issued its recommendation to this court. 
After the recommendation was filed, this court became aware of the charges in 
00-DB-007. Therefore, the case was remanded to the disciplinary board to issue a 
single recommendation in all three matters.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> Supreme Court Rule XIX, §10(C) sets forth the following 
factors for consideration in imposing sanctions:<br>
(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to 
the legal system, or to the profession;<br>
(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently; <br>
(3) the amount of the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's 
misconduct; and<br>
(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">5</a> The board cited Standard 4.42, which provides suspension 
is appropriate “when a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for a client 
and causes injury or potential injury to a client,” Standard 4.12, which 
provides for suspension “when a lawyer knows or should know that he is dealing 
improperly with client property and causes injury or potential injury to a 
client,” and Standard 7.2, which provides for suspension “when a lawyer 
knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed to the 
profession, and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, or 
the legal system.”</p>

prior offenses because these matters were not yet final.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn8">8</a> The board noted that the committee’s recommendation in
