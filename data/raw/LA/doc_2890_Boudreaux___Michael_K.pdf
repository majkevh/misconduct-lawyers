  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE:  MICHAEL K. BOUDREAUX</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NUMBER:  05-DB-049</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of formal charges against the Respondent,
  Michael K. Boudreaux, by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC").  For reasons stated below, the Disciplinary
  Board orders that the Respondent receive a public reprimand and be assessed with all costs and expenses of these
  proceedings.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Formal charges, consisting of one count, were filed against the Respondent by ODC on May 11,
  2005.<a name="_ftnref1" class="fn" href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>  In the charges, ODC alleges that the
  Respondent violated Rules of Professional Conduct 1.8(h), 8.4(a) and 8.4(c)<a name="_ftnref2" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> in connection with his representation of a client in a worker's compensation
  matter.  The charges were served upon the Respondent via certified mail on May 13, 2005.  The Respondent failed to
  answer the charges, and consequently, ODC filed a "Motion to Declare Factual Allegations Deemed Proven and Scheduling
  Written Arguments" on June 8, 2005. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC's motion was granted by the chair of Hearing Committee Number 15, David Kimmel, on June 22,
  2005.  In the order granting the motion, the factual allegations contained in the formal charges were deemed admitted
  and proven by clear and convincing evidence, the Respondent was given twenty days from the mailing of the order to
  demonstrate good cause why the imposition of the order would be improper, and the parties were given until August 17,
  2005 to file written arguments and documentary evidence on the issue of sanctions.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Respondent did not file a motion to recall the deemed admitted order.  ODC filed its "Deemed
  Admitted Submission on Sanctions" on August 17, 2005.  The Respondent did not file a submission.  The hearing
  committee issued its report on December 2, 2005, finding that the Respondent violated the Rules of Professional
  Conduct as charged and recommending that the Respondent receive a public reprimand.  On December 27, 2005, ODC filed
  a notice indicating that it had no opposition to the hearing committee's opinion.  On February 22, 2006, the
  Respondent faxed a letter to the Disciplinary Board indicating that he admitted the formal charges, that he had no
  objection to the hearing committee's report, and that he would not attend the oral argument before the Disciplinary
  Board.  Oral argument before Panel "B" of the Disciplinary Board was held on February 23, 2006.  Deputy Disciplinary
  Counsel Shana M. Broussard appeared on behalf of ODC. As previously indicated in his letter, the Respondent did not
  appear.</p>

  <h2>THE FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The formal charges in this matter read, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"In or about 1988, Ralph A. Steptoe hired <b>BOUDREAUX</b> to pursue a worker's compensation claim.  In April of
    1999, <b>BOUDREAUX</b> met with Mr. Steptoe and his brother.  At that time, <b>BOUDREAUX</b> notified Mr. Steptoe
    in writing that the worker's compensation claim had prescribed.  On July 10, 2000 and February 22,
    2002<a name="_ftnref3" class="fn" href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, <b>BOUDREAUX</b> prepared settlement sheets
    and forwarded payments to Mr. Steptoe in the amount of $10,000.00 for a total of $20,000.00.  The context of the
    settlement sheet provided:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This is to verify that I received $10,000.00 (ten thousand and no/100 dollars) on July 10, 2000 from Michael
      K. Boudreaux as partial settlement of my claim from my workers' compensation case.</p>

      <p><u>/s/</u></p>

      <p>Ralph Steptoe</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><b>BOUDREAUX</b> attempted to settle a claim for malpractice by the payment of $20,000.00.  <b>BOUDREAUX</b>
    failed to advise Mr. Steptoe in writing that independent representation was appropriate.</p>

    <p><b>BOUDREAUX's</b> conduct violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.8(h)</span>,
    <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> of the Rules of Professional
    Conduct."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2005-12-02_05-DB-049.htm">THE HEARING COMMITTEE'S REPORT</a></span></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As stated above, the hearing committee issued its report on December 2, 2005.  In its report, the
  committee found that the factual allegations of the formal charges had been deemed admitted and proven by clear and
  convincing evidence.  The committee also determined that Rules <span class="Rules">1.8(h)</span>,
  <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span> had been violated by the Respondent, and it
   relied upon <i>ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, Standard 4.33<a name="_ftnref4" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, in deciding that the baseline sanction was a public reprimand.  The committee
  found that the aggravating factors of <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span><a name="_ftnref5" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>, and <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary record</span><a name="_ftnref6"
  class="fn" href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>  were present.  The committee further determined that the mitigating
  factors of <span class="ABAstandard">substantial restitution</span> in the amount of $20,000.00 and
  <span class="ABAstandard">timely good faith effort to make restitution or to rectify the consequences of the
  misconduct</span> were present.  The committee concluded that a public reprimand was the appropriate sanction. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC filed a notice indicating that it had no opposition to the hearing committee's report on
  December 27, 2005.  In his letter of February 22, 2006 faxed to the Disciplinary Board, the Respondent also indicated
  that he had no objection to the hearing committee's report.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <h3>I.  The Standard Of Review</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The powers and duties of the Disciplinary Board are defined in Section 2 of the Louisiana Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement.  Subsection (G)(2)(a) states that the Board is "to perform
  appellate review functions, consisting of review of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of
  hearing committees with respect to formal charges . . . and prepare and forward to the court its own findings, if
  any, and recommendations."<b> </b> Inasmuch as the Board is serving in an appellate capacity, the standard of review
  applied to findings of fact is that of "manifest error."  <i>Arceneaux v. Domingue</i>, 365 So. 2d 1330 (La.1978);
  <i>Rosell v. ESCO</i>, 549 So. 2d 840 (La. 1989).  The Board conducts a <i>de novo</i> review of the hearing
  committee's application of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  <i>In re Hill</i>, 90-DB-004. Here, the factual
  findings<a name="_ftnref7" class="fn" href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a> of the hearing committee in this deemed
  admitted matter are supported by the factual allegations asserted by ODC in the formal charges and/or by the evidence
  submitted in support of the allegations, save the allegation that Respondent allowed Mr. Steptoe's case to
  "prescribe."  <i>See</i> <span class="cite"><i>In re Donnan</i>, 01-3058 (La. 1/10/03);
  <a href="../SC/2003-01-10_2001-3058.htm">838 So.2d 715</a></span>.  The evidence submitted in support of the
  allegations shows that suit was timely filed on behalf of Mr. Steptoe, but that the Respondent allowed the case to
  become abandoned.  <i>See</i> La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 561 (West 2006); ODC Exhibit 10, Sworn Statement of
  Respondent, pp. 5-6.<a name="_ftnref8" class="fn" href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a>  Nevertheless, based upon its
  other factual findings, the committee properly found that the Respondent violated Rules 1.8(h), 8.4(a) and 8.4(c) of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct, and, as discussed below, the Board adopts these findings. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">At the time of the misconduct in this matter, the applicable version of Rule 1.8(h) provided that
  a lawyer could not settle a claim for malpractice liability with an unrepresented client or former client without
  first advising that person in writing that independent representation was appropriate.  Here, at his April 1999
  meeting with Mr. Steptoe, Respondent told Mr. Steptoe that he owed him money because he had allowed his case to
  "prescribe."  He also advised Mr. Steptoe of his option of seeking independent counsel to file a malpractice suit
  against him. Respondent did not put this information into writing, however.  At his sworn statement, Respondent
  testified as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"I don't know why I didn't put that [the information concerning Mr. Steptoe's legal options] in writing.  I just
    assumed that the conversation, with his brother there making the interpretation, thatthat should have conveyed the
    information to him.  I did follow-up with a letter, which I gave to him, and I think I also mailed, I don't know
    why I would have done it if I hadn't mailed it, advising him and thanking him for meeting with me and confirming
    that, you know, I had described that his case had prescribed, and I think II have given you a copy of  of that
    letter."<a name="_ftnref9" class="fn" href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>

    <p>ODC Exhibit 10, Sworn Statement of Respondent, p. 11.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In response to ODC's question as to whether settlement of Mr. Steptoe's claim was discussed at
  the meeting, Respondent continued:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Yes. . . . [W]hat I told him at that meeting was that, you know, 'Mr. Steptoe, I owe you money for your case. 
    It's my fault that the case prescribed and, at some point, I will have to pay you money for your case, whether you
    go to an attorney or don't go to an attorney, whether you go to the Disciplinary Board or don't go to the
    Disciplinary Board, it's my responsibility to try to compensate you for that.'"</p>

    <p><i>Id.</i> at p. 12.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent also testified at his sworn statement that at the meeting, no specific settlement
  amount was discussed.  Id. at 11-12.  However, in February of 2000, he sent Mr. Steptoe the first partial payment of
  $10,000.  He sent Mr. Steptoe another payment of $10,000 in July of 2000.  Mr. Steptoe cashed both checks. <i>Id.</i>
  at  27.  ODC does not contest the fact that Respondent orally advised his client to seek independent counsel prior to
  settling the case.  Nevertheless, a Rule 1.8(h) violation is present as Respondent failed to put this advice in
  writing.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Further, a Rule 8.4(c) violation also is present.  At the time of the misconduct at hand, this
  rule provided that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,
  deceit or misrepresentation.   ODC takes issue with the two "settlement sheets" Respondent sent with the two
  $10,000.00 payments to Mr. Steptoe.  ODC specifically maintains that that "Respondent forwarded two 'settlement
  sheets' and checks in the amount of $10,000 under the guise of settling a worker's compensation case.  The client
  could only believe with the misrepresentation of the respondent that his worker's compensation claim had settled." 
  These facts, as restated in the formal charges, along with Mr. Steptoe's complaint and letters to ODC in which he
  questions the whereabouts of additional settlement funds<a name="_ftnref10" class="fn" href="#_ftn10"
  id="_ftnref10">[10]</a>, properly form the basis of a Rule 8.4(c) violation.  After reading the settlement sheets,
  Mr. Steptoe was apparently misled into believing that the worker's compensation claim had been settled and that he
  had additional settlement funds due from the worker's compensation insurer.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Because violations of Rules 1.8(h) and 8.4(c) are present, a violation of Rule 8.4(a) must also
  be found.  The applicable version of this rule provided that it was professional misconduct for a lawyer to "violate
  . . .  the Rules of Professional Conduct . . .". </p>

  <h3>II.  The Appropriate Sanction</h3>

  <h4><b>A.  Application of the Rule XIX, Section 10(C) Factors</b></h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Here, the Respondent has violated duties owed to his client, Mr. Steptoe.  His conduct of
  settling the malpractice claim without advising Mr. Steptoe in writing to seek independent counsel appears to be
  negligent.  In his sworn statement, Respondent states that he explained to Mr. Steptoe in a meeting that his claim
  had "prescribed" and that he owed Mr. Steptoe compensation for his case.  He further explained to Mr. Steptoe that he
  had the option of filing a disciplinary complaint against him and/or of hiring another attorney to review his case
  and to bring a malpractice suit against him.  He negligently failed, however, to place this information in
  writing. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Potential injury was present in that Mr. Steptoe is hearing impaired and mute, and he could have
  easily been taken advantage of without this information being placed in writing.  The record shows, however, that the
  Respondent did not do so.  As noted above, the Respondent advised Mr. Steptoe in writing that his claim had
  "prescribed."  <i>See</i> ODC Exhibit 11.<i> </i> The settlement amount paid to Mr. Steptoe was reasonable and fair.
  <i>See</i> Hrg. Comm. Rpt., p. 4.<a name="_ftnref11" class="fn" href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The aggravating factors of substantial experience in the practice of law, dishonest or selfish
  motive and prior disciplinary offense are present.  The mitigating factor of timely good faith effort to make
  restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct is also present.</p>

  <h4>B.  Louisiana Case Law</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee noted in its report that it reviewed the cases of <span class="cite"><i>In
  re Fazande</i>, 2003-2210 (La. 1/21/04), <a href="../SC/2004-01-21_2003-2210.htm">864 So.2d 174</a></span> and
  <span class="cite"><i>In re Dunn</i>, 1998-0535 (La. 6/5/98), <a href="../SC/1998-06-05_1998-0535.htm">713 So.2d
  461</a></span> in reaching its proposed sanction of a public reprimand.  In <i>Fazande</i>, two counts of formal
  charges were filed against the respondent.  The first count alleged that the respondent neglected a legal matter and
  allowed the case to be dismissed upon motion of the opposing party. The second count alleged that he allowed another
  claim to prescribe and then failed to advise his clients in writing to seek outside counsel to discuss their
  potential malpractice claims.  Numerous aggravating factors were present, including prior
  discipline<a name="_ftnref12" class="fn" href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a>, substantial legal experience,
  pattern of misconduct, and multiple offenses.  The mitigating factor of cooperative attitude towards the proceedings
  and absence of a dishonest or selfish motive were also present.  <i>Id.</i> at 178-79.  The Court held that the
  respondent did not violate Rule 1.8(h) of the Rules of Professional Conduct because the settlement discussions never
  progressed to the point of a formal offer of settlement by the respondent or an acceptance of any offer by his
  clients.  <i>Id.</i> at 180.  Consequently, the Court imposed a six month suspension, with three months deferred,
  followed by a one year period of probation, based upon respondent's lack of diligence and failure to communicate with
  his clients in both counts.  <i>Id.</i> at 180-81.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <i>Dunn</i>, the respondent was retained by a client to pursue a personal injury case arising
  out of a vehicular accident.  While respondent timely filed suit on the client's behalf, he failed to actively pursue
  the case for over five years, ultimately resulting in a dismissal of the suit on grounds of abandonment.  After the
  client advised respondent of the dismissal of her lawsuit, he acknowledged his error and offered to settle with her
  for the amount of $4,500.00.  However, he did not advise the client to seek advice from independent counsel on the
  settlement. Shortly thereafter, the respondent forwarded a check to his client in the amount of $1,500.00. <i>Id.</i>
  at 462. The Board noted that numerous aggravating factors were present, including substantial experience in the
  practice of law, prior discipline<a name="_ftnref13" class="fn" href="#_ftn13" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a>, selfish
  motive, pattern of misconduct and vulnerability of victim.  Mitigating factors included respondent's personal
  problems, acknowledgement of his error, his immediate attempt to make his client whole and candor with his client. 
  <i>Id.</i> at 463.  After reviewing the matter, the Court noted that while the respondent had clearly violated the
  Rules of Professional Conduct, the record supported the hearing committee's finding that "respondent intended to be
  fair and reasonable and he was not attempting to exploit his representation of the client."  Under such
  circumstances, the Court concluded that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six
  months, all deferred, subject to a one year probationary period with conditions.  <i>Id.</i> at 464.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Finally, the case of <span class="cite"><i>In re Thompson</i>, 1998-0079 (La. 5/8/98),
  <a href="../SC/1998-05-08_1998-0079.htm">712 So.2d 72</a></span> also offers guidance here.  In <i>Thompson</i>, the
  respondent was retained by a client to pursue a worker's compensation claim.  The respondent failed to timely pursue
  the claim and believed it had prescribed.  Since respondent did not have professional liability insurance, he made a
  "personal agreement" with the client to advance up to $7,500.00 to her.  After taking into account his fee, the
  respondent paid the client approximately $5,000.00 over a two year period and had his client execute a "distribution
  statement" drafted in the language of tort claim receipt and release agreement.  <i>Id.</i> at 73.  The parties
  stipulated that the mitigating factors of no prior disciplinary record, free disclosure with ODC and inexperience in
  the practice of law were present.  The aggravating factors of dishonest or selfish motive, vulnerability of victim
  and refusal to acknowledge the wrongful conduct were adopted by the Court.  <i>Id.</i> at 73-74.  The Court also
  adopted the hearing committee's finding that the respondent permitted his client's case to prescribe and later became
  involved in a conflict of interest when he tried to settle his liability without advising his client to seek
  independent legal advice.  <i>Id</i>. at 74.  The Court imposed a suspension of one year, all deferred, subject to an
  eighteen month period of supervised probation with conditions.  <i>Id</i>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The matter at hand is similar to <i>Dunn</i> and <i>Thompson</i> in that the Respondent did not
  follow the guidelines of Rule 1.8(h) in attempting to settle his malpractice matter with his client.  Unlike
  <i>Dunn</i> and <i>Thompson</i>, Mr. Boudreaux did advise his client to seek independent counsel.  Nevertheless, he
  failed to place this advice in writing.  Further, like the respondent in <i>Dunn</i>, Mr. Boudreaux actions appear to
  be "fair and reasonable" and "not an attempt to exploit his representation of the client."  Because of the negligent
  nature of Respondent's conduct and his good faith efforts to make restitution to Mr. Steptoe, a public reprimand as
  recommended by ODC and the hearing committee, instead of a deferred suspension, appears to be appropriate.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the above, the Board modifies the hearing committee's report to correct the finding that
  the Respondent allowed Mr. Steptoe's case to prescribe; instead, the Board finds that the case was abandoned.  The
  Board adopts the hearing committee's report in all other respects and orders that the Respondent receive a public
  reprimand. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board also orders that the Respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these
  proceedings.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">A. Prescription would have been about a year after they stopped paying him for his worker's
    compensation and I'm not sure whenit's some place in the fileas to when that happened but we did file a suit.  I
    did file the suit for him in the case.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">Q. And where did you file it?</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">A. It was in the 21<sup>st</sup> JDC.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">Q. And what was the result of that?</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">A.  We had continued the case.  We had filed it and had a deposition or two and the case
    had been continued to be re-filed.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">Q.  Re-filed, meaning?</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">A.  To be noto be reset as some time in the future when we thought the case was ready
    togo back to courtto go to court.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">Q. Okay, and why was it not reset?</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">A.  That's a very good question that I don't know the answer to.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn10" class="fn" href="#_ftnref10" id="_ftn10">[10]</a> The formal charges address
  this issue by quoting the language of the settlement sheet sent with both the February 22, 2000 and the July 10, 2000
  payments.  In the formal charges, ODC asserts that this language  reads:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">  "This is to verify that I received $10,000.00 (ten thousand and no/100 dollars) on July
    10, 2000 from Michael K. Boudreaux as partial settlement of my claim from my workers' compensation case.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">  /<u>s</u>/</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">  Ralph Steptoe"</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="footnotetext">ODC Exhibit 2 shows that the same language was used in the settlement sheet sent with the
  February 22, 2000 payment, except the date on that settlement sheet sent read February 22, 2000.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext">ODC further asserts in the formal charges that "Boudreaux attempted to settle a claim for
  malpractice by the payment of $20,000.00."</p>

  <p class="footnotetext">In his complaint, Mr. Steptoe states that " . . . the last time I [saw Respondent] was 2000
  and 2001.  I was supposed to get [a] settlement from 1986 to 2002, I should have [a] settlement counted plus
  $109,912.00.  But he never act[ed] [to] do it for me.  I know that he already got [a] settlement before . . . I
  didn't know [the] arrangement.  . . . We never [withdrew] money from worker compensation [for] my case."  <i>See</i>
  ODC Exhibit 1.   In his letters written to ODC during the investigation of this matter, it appears that Mr. Steptoe
  believed that the settlement amounts paid by Respondent on February 22, 2000 and July 10, 2000 were from Respondent's
  personal funds, but that additional funds were due from the worker's compensation insurer.  <i>See</i> ODC Exhibits 3
  and 4.  As explained above, because Mr. Steptoe's claim had been abandoned, no settlement funds were due from the
  worker's compensation insurer.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn11" class="fn" href="#_ftnref11" id="_ftn11">[11]</a> The committee noted
  that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">  "Respondent further testified that the $20,000.00 payment to Complainant was based upon a
    combination of Social Security and Worker's Compensation payments that Complainant received for 62 weeks. 
    Respondent contended that for 458 weeks the Complainant received $2,000.00 less per year when worker's compensation
    discontinued the payments. Respondent calculated the Complainant's total loss at $17,600.00 and therefore he
    settled with the Complainant for $20,000.00. </p>

    <p class="footnotetext">The Committee finds that Respondent's conduct appeared to be generally geared towards
    making the client whole and to provide restitution which is a mitigating factor.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">Hrg. Comm. Rpt., p. 4.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="footnotetext">In his sworn statement, the Respondent explained that he reached the $20,000.00 amount by
  determining what Mr. Steptoe would have been paid for his worker's compensation over the course of the ten year
  period that he was entitled to receive the benefits.  Respondent testified that this amount came to "a little over
  $17,000.00."  Respondent also added to that figure an amount to compensate Mr. Steptoe for any medical expenses he
  might have had and arrived at the $20,000.00 figure.  ODC Exhibit 10, Sworn Statement of Respondent, pp. 27-29. </p>

  <p class="footnotetext">In his letter dated February 12, 2004 in which Respondent responds to Mr. Steptoe's complaint
  to ODC, he further explains the settlement figure as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">  "Prior to his injury, Mr. Steptoe earned approximately $9,900.00 per year.  He received
    Worker's Compensation payment of $127 a week for 62 weeks, totaling $7762.  This $127 per week plus Social Security
    Disability gave him an income of $7920 per year which was the maximum 80% of his pre-injury income.  When Worker's
    Comp stopped paying him he qualified for additional Social Security Benefits and began receiving approximately $500
    per month in disability payments.  This totaled approximately $6,000 per year which he continued to receive
    throughout the duration of his claim period.  This amount was about $2000 less than the $7920 maximum he could have
    received from a combination of Social Security and Worker's Compensation payments.  Since he received both Social
    Security and Worker's Compensation payments for 62 weeks that left 458 weeks (8.8 years) in which he received
    $2,000 less per year that he would have received if both Social Security and Worker's Comp had been paying, or
    approximately $17,600 less over the 458 week period.  If Mr. Steptoe had received a Worker's Comp settlement,
    Social Security would have reduced or eliminated its payments by offsetting the settlement against its payments
    until the Worker's Comp settlement had been "used up" against the Social Security benefits. In the alternative,
    Worker's Comp would have been entitled to offset the Social Security Payments received by Mr. Steptoe, leaving the
    same $17,600."</p>
