<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 00-B-0102<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: EDWARD M. NICHOLS, JR.</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM<a href="#FN*">*</a></p>

<p class="Bodycopy">This discipline matter arises from a petition for consent 
discipline filed jointly by respondent, Edward M. Nichols, Jr., and the Office 
of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") following the institution of formal charges.</p>

<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">Cathy Miller Benoit retained respondent in May 1996 to 
represent her in connection with a contractual dispute and a related redhibition 
claim.  Although respondent timely 
filed suit on Ms. Benoit's behalf, he failed to make a request for arbitration, 
which was apparently required under the contract.  This omission led to the dismissal of 
Ms. Benoit's contractual claim in March 1998.  Thereafter, respondent failed to take 
any action to move Ms. Benoit's other matters forward and failed to keep her 
reasonably informed about the status of her legal matters.</p>

<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

<h3> Formal 
Charges </h3>

<p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed one count of formal 
charges against Respondent, alleging he violated Rules <span class="Rules"> <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id&id=RULE1.1">1.1</a>(a)</span> (failure to provide competent representation to a 
client), <span class="Rules"> <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id&id=RULE1.3">1.3</a></span> (failure to act with diligence and promptness in 
representing a client), and <span class="Rules"> <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id&id=RULE1.4">1.4</a> (a)</span> (failure to communicate with a client) of the 
Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Prior to a formal hearing in the matter, respondent and the 
ODC filed a joint petition for consent discipline.  Respondent admits that he failed to 
represent Ms. Benoit competently, neglected her legal matter, and failed to 
communicate with her, in violation of Rules <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id&id=RULE1.1">1.1</a>(a), <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id&id=RULE1.3">1.3</a>, and <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id&id=RULE1.4">1.4</a>(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  For this misconduct, respondent and the 
ODC proposed that respondent be suspended for six months, deferred, subject to 
completion of one year of probation.</p>

<h3>Disciplinary Board Recommendation</h3>

<p class="Bodycopy">In its report, the disciplinary board found that respondent 
violated a duty owed to his client and the legal system, and that his omissions, 
while negligent, caused actual harm to his client. The board noted the presence of only one 
aggravating factor, namely substantial experience in the practice of law 
(admitted 1986), but found several mitigating factors, including the absence of 
a prior disciplinary record, the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, and a 
cooperative attitude toward the proceedings.  Relying on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer 
Sanctions</i><sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup> and on 
jurisprudence from this court, the board concluded that the proposed consent 
discipline is appropriate to address respondent's misconduct.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, the board recommended that the proposed consent 
discipline be accepted and that respondent be suspended from the practice of law 
for six months, deferred, subject to completion of one year of probation.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the board's 
recommendation.</p>



<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">Arguably, respondent's failure to request arbitration, which 
resulted in the dismissal of his client's contractual claim, may constitute 
legal malpractice, but does not necessarily involve ethical misconduct.  However, respondent has admitted that he 
failed to pursue his client's redhibition claim and failed to communicate with 
his client, causing her actual harm.  Under these circumstances, we agree he has violated the professional 
rules as charged.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">The case most factually similar to the instant matter is
<span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Andrepont, 98-</i>0346 (La. 3/13/98), 
<a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=712%20So.2d%20862$t=document-frame.htm$3.0$p=">712 So. 2d 862</a></span>, in which we accepted consent discipline consisting of a 
ninety-day suspension for an attorney who neglected a legal matter.  Given the mitigating factors in this 
case, including respondent's lack of a prior disciplinary record, we find that a 
six-month suspension from the practice of law, fully deferred and subject to 
respondent's successful completion of a year of probation is appropriate under 
the circumstances. Accordingly, we will accept the joint petition for consent 
discipline.</p>

<h2>DECREE</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the 
disciplinary board, and considering the record filed herein, it is ordered that 
Edward M. Nichols, Jr. be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six 
months, deferred, subject to respondent's completion of one year of 
probation. All costs and expenses 
in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court 
Rule XIX, ยง 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of 
finality of this court' s judgment until paid.</p>

when a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for a client and causes injury 
or potential injury to a client, or when a lawyer engages in a pattern of 
neglect and causes injury or potential injury to a client.</p>
