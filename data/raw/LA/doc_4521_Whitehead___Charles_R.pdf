<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: CHARLES R. WHITEHEAD, III</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

<p style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 150%">PER CURIAM</p>
<p>&nbsp;


&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">This disciplinary matter stems from five counts of formal charges filed by 
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Charles R. 
Whitehead, III, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn1"><font size="1">1</font></a></span></p>
<p align="center"><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></p>
<p align="center"><i>Counts I and II - Valrie Matter</i></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">In January 1997, Alabama attorney M. Dale Marsh referred one of his clients, 
Janice Valrie, to respondent for representation in connection with a domestic 
proceeding in Louisiana. Respondent sent a letter to Mr. Marsh agreeing to 
handle Ms. Valrie’s case on an hourly basis, with payment for the fee coming out 
of any settlement received by her. Respondent further requested that Ms. Valrie 
pay a $150 filing fee, which she immediately did by way of a cashier’s check 
issued to the Clerk of Court’s Office for the Tenth Judicial District Court and 
directed to respondent’s office.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Initially, respondent took some action in the matter by communicating with 
opposing counsel and forwarding a letter to Mr. Marsh. However, after several 
weeks, respondent failed to return telephone calls or answer correspondence from 
either Ms. Valrie or Mr. Marsh regarding the status of the case. Eventually, Ms. 
Valrie retained other counsel to complete the matter. </p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Ms. Valrie and Mr. Marsh each filed a complaint with the ODC seeking a return 
of Ms. Valrie’s original documents and filing fee. Respondent failed to comply 
with the ODC’s numerous requests for information about the matter, requiring the 
ODC to issue four subpoenas to compel his cooperation. He responded to only one 
of the subpoenas, asserting he did not take any further action in Ms. Valrie’s 
matter because he failed to receive a retainer and the filing costs from her.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn2"><font size="1">2</font></a></span></p>
<p align="center"><i>Count III - Cadwallader Matter</i></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">In November 1996, Julie Cadwallader paid respondent $500 to represent her in 
a domestic proceeding which involved issues of divorce, community property, 
child support and child custody. While respondent successfully obtained a 
judgment of divorce for his client, he subsequently failed to take any action 
regarding the other matters. As a result, Ms. Cadwallader fell into financial 
hardship and had her residential utilities disconnected. Ms. Cadwallader 
ultimately retained other counsel, who completed the case in approximately one 
month. Ms. Cadwallader then filed a complaint with the ODC advising of 
respondent’s misconduct. </p>
<p align="center"><i>Count V &amp; VI - Mid America Matter</i></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">In 1995, Robert Nauman, on behalf of his employer, Mid America Collection 
Services USA, referred a pending collection suit to respondent. Thereafter, Mr. 
Nauman sent respondent a letter requesting that respondent amend the petition in 
the suit to add an additional defendant. Mr. Nauman received no response from 
respondent to this correspondence. Mr. Nauman followed up his initial 
correspondence with more than 150 telephone calls and numerous other letters, 
but respondent did not reply. </p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Mr. Nauman filed a complaint with the ODC advising of respondent’s 
misconduct. When respondent failed to reply to the complaint, the ODC subpoenaed 
respondent to appear for a scheduled deposition and produce his file. In lieu of 
the deposition, respondent sent a letter to the ODC in which he indicated that 
his entire file in the matter was attached; however, the file was not attached 
to the letter received by the ODC. The ODC agreed to cancel respondent’s 
deposition, with the understanding that he would supplement his response and 
include his entire file. When he failed to supplement his response and he was 
again subpoenaed for a scheduled deposition, respondent neglected to appear. 
Although the ODC requested that respondent contact the office as soon as 
possible to reschedule the deposition, respondent refused to respond to the 
request. </p>
<p align="center"><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
<p align="center"><i>Formal Charges</i></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">The ODC filed six counts of formal charges against respondent, alleging that 
his conduct violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct: Rules <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.3 --#">1.3</a> (failure to act with diligence and promptness in representing 
a client), <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.4 --#">1.4</a> (failure to communicate with a client),
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.5 --#">1.5</a> (fee arrangements), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(c) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or 
misrepresentation) and <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(g) (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its 
investigation).<br>
Respondent filed an answer and the matter was set for formal hearing.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn3"><font size="1">3</font></a></span></p>
<p align="center"><i>Formal Hearing</i></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">At the hearing, respondent stipulated to the allegations of misconduct, so 
the hearing was limited to the question of the appropriate sanction. Respondent 
testified on his own behalf. He expressed remorse for his failure to communicate 
with his clients and the ODC, and admitted he could have handled the matters 
more professionally. He attributed much of his problems to the lack of an 
adequate office staff and calendaring system, which he stated he had rectified.</p>
<p align="center"><i><a href="#!-- #ID:98-DB-066.HC --#">Recommendation of the 
Hearing Committee</a></i></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Based on respondent’s stipulation, the hearing committee found the ODC had 
proven by clear and convincing evidence violations of Rules 
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.3 --#">1.3</a> (failure to act 
with diligence and promptness in representing a client),
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.4 --#">1.4</a> (failure to 
communicate with a client), <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.5 --#">1.5</a> (failure to return unearned fees), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(c) 
(engaging in conduct involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation) 
and <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(g) (failure to cooperate with the ODC in a disciplinary investigation). 
The committee found respondent’s conduct reflected badly on the legal 
profession. As a sanction, it recommended that respondent be suspended from the 
practice of law for a period of one year, with six months deferred, subject to a 
two year period of probation with conditions.</p>
<p align="center"><i><a href="#!-- #ID:98-DB-066A.DB --#">Recommendation of the 
Disciplinary Board</a></i></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">The disciplinary board adopted the hearing committee’s findings of fact. It 
further concluded respondent violated duties owed to his clients and the 
disciplinary system. The board found respondent’s conduct caused actual harm to 
his clients, because their cases were delayed. It noted Ms. Cadwallader in 
particular suffered financial hardship because respondent failed to pursue her 
child support matter. Moreover, it pointed out the disciplinary system was 
harmed by respondent’s repeated failure to cooperate with the initial 
disciplinary proceedings. </p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">In addressing the issue of sanctions, the board found the baseline sanction 
under Standards 4.42 and 7.2 of the ABA’s <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer 
Sanctions</i><span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn4"><font size="1">4</font></a></span> was a suspension. As to aggravating factors, the board recognized 
respondent’s prior disciplinary offense,<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn5"><font size="1">5</font></a></span> pattern of misconduct, multiple 
offenses, substantial experience in the practice of law<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn6"><font size="1">6</font></a></span> and failure to 
cooperate in the initial disciplinary process. As to mitigating factors, the 
board considered respondent’s remorse, character and reputation,<span style="vertical-align: super"><font size="1"><a href="#fn7">7</a></font></span> cooperative 
attitude through the submission of previous consent discipline petitions and 
absence of selfish motive. </p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Considering these factors, the board recommended respondent be suspended from 
the practice of law for a period of one year with six months deferred, subject 
to a one year period of probation. As conditions of probation, the board 
recommended that respondent successfully complete the Louisiana State Bar 
Association’s Ethics School and make an accounting and restitution to Ms. 
Cadwallader.<span style="vertical-align: super"><font size="1"><a href="#fn8">8</a></font></span></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Respondent filed an objection in this court to the severity of the proposed 
sanction. As a result, the court docketed the matter for briefing and argument 
in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s11G --#">11</a>(G)(1)(b). </p>
<p align="center"><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">The record establishes that respondent failed to pursue three client matters, 
failed to communicate with three clients, failed to refund unearned fees owed to 
at least one client and failed to cooperate with the ODC in two disciplinary 
investigations. Therefore, the only issue to be addressed by the court is an 
appropriate sanction for the underlying misconduct.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary 
proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the 
public, preserve the integrity of the profession and deter future misconduct. 
<i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987). The discipline to 
be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the 
offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances. <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 
1984).</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Respondent’s misconduct caused actual harm to his clients by significantly 
delaying resolution of their legal matters. Ms. Cadwallader in particular 
suffered financial harm as a result of respondent’s needless delay of her case. 
Likewise, the disciplinary system was harmed by respondent’s consistent failure 
to cooperate, requiring the ODC to undergo the extra expense and time of issuing 
subpoenas to compel a response. </p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">The baseline sanction for respondent’s misconduct is a suspension from the 
practice of law. See <i>In re: Szuba</i>, 01-1877 (La. 10/5/01), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:797%20So.2d%2041 --#">797 So. 2d 41</a> (two 
year suspension, subject to a one year period of probation, imposed on an 
attorney with a prior disciplinary record who neglected three legal matters, 
failed to communicate with his clients and failed to return client property); <i>In 
re: Boudreau</i>, 00-3158 (La. 1/5/01), <a href="#!-- #ID:776%20So.2d%20428 --#">776 So. 2d 428</a> (three year suspension 
imposed on attorney who neglected three client matters, failed to communicate 
with the clients, failed to account for and return unearned fees, failed to 
repay a student loan, withheld client property and failed to cooperate with the ODC); 
<i>In re: Smith</i>, 00-2627 (La. 11/28/00), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:775%20So.2d%201 --#">775 So. 2d 1</a> (one year and one day 
suspension followed by a two year period of probation imposed on attorney with a 
prior disciplinary record who neglected two client matters, failed to 
communicate with clients, failed to refund unearned fees, engaged in the 
unauthorized practice of law and failed to cooperate with ODC); <i>In re: Powers</i>, 
99-2069 (La. 9/24/99), <a href="#!-- #ID:744%20So.2d%201275 --#">744 So. 2d 1275</a> (three year suspension imposed on 
attorney with a prior disciplinary record for similar misconduct who neglected 
three clients’ legal matters, failed to communicate with the clients, failed to 
account for and return unearned fees and failed to cooperate with the ODC); <i>In 
re: Hollis</i>, 98-0444 (La. 6/19/98), <a href="#!-- #ID:714%20So.2d%20693 --#">714 So. 2d 693</a> (one year and one day 
suspension imposed on an attorney who accepted a retainer to represent two 
clients, failed to pursue their case and failed to communicate with them); and 
<i>In re: Cohen</i>, 98-0291 (La. 3/27/98), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:708%20So.2d%20415  --#">708 So. 2d 415 </a>(three year suspension, with 
twenty-one months deferred, followed by a two year period of unsupervised 
probation with conditions, stemming from nine disciplinary complaints alleging 
neglect, failure to communicate, failure to return client funds and failure to 
cooperate with the ODC).</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">As aggravating factors, we recognize respondent’s prior disciplinary record, 
a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, substantial experience in the 
practice of law and failure to cooperate in the disciplinary process. In 
mitigation, we find respondent has shown evidence of remorse, as well as good 
character and reputation in the community and an absence of any selfish motive.
</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Considering the facts of this case, we conclude a one year suspension from 
the practice of law is the appropriate sanction for respondent’s misconduct. We 
will defer six months of this suspension, and place respondent on unsupervised 
probation for a period of one year, subject to the conditions recommended by the 
disciplinary board.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn9"><font size="1">9</font></a></span> Any violation of the conditions of probation or any 
additional misconduct during the probationary period will be grounds for making 
the deferred period of the suspension executory and/or imposing additional 
discipline, as appropriate. </p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Accordingly, we find the disciplinary board’s recommendation to be 
appropriate under the facts.</p>
<p align="center"><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and 
disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that Charles R. 
Whitehead, III be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year. 
Six months of this suspension shall be deferred, subject to a one year period of 
probation. During the period of probation, respondent shall comply with the 
conditions of probation recommended by the disciplinary board. It is further 
ordered that any misconduct during the probationary period will be grounds for 
making the deferred period of the suspension executory and/or imposing 
additional discipline, as appropriate. All costs and expenses in the matter are 
assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, §10.1, 
with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this 
court’s judgment until paid.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<hr color="#000000" align="left" width="100" size="1">
<p><a name="fn1">&nbsp;1</a> Originally, six counts of misconduct were filed 
against respondent. At the formal disciplinary hearing, the ODC dismissed Count 
IV and, thus, no further reference will be made herein regarding this charge.
</p>
<p><a name="fn2">2</a> Respondent’s statement is contrary to the evidence, which 
indicate he agreed that his fee would come from any settlement received by Ms. 
Valrie. </p>
<p><a name="fn3">3</a> Prior to the hearing, respondent filed a petition for 
consent discipline, in which he initially proposed a fully deferred six-month 
suspension, subject to an eighteen-month period of supervised probation with 
conditions. The ODC concurred in respondent’s petition. However, the 
disciplinary board unanimously rejected the petition, finding the proposed 
discipline was too lenient. Respondent then filed a supplemental and amending 
petition for consent discipline, proposing that he be suspended from the 
practice of law for sixty days and that he participate in Ethics School. Once 
again, the ODC concurred in respondent’s petition. On April 11, 2000, the 
disciplinary board, with two members dissenting, recommended the supplemental 
and amending petition for consent discipline be accepted. On May 26, 2000, this 
court rejected the petition for consent discipline and remanded the case for 
further proceedings. <i>In re: Whitehead</i>, 00-1045 (La. 5/26/00),
<a href="#!-- #ID:762%20So.2d%20630 --#">762 So. 2d 630</a>.</p>
<p><a name="fn4">4</a> Standard 4.42 provides “[s]uspension is generally 
appropriate when: (a) a lawyer fails to perform services for a client and causes 
injury or potential injury to a client; or (b) a lawyer engages in a pattern of 
neglect and causes injury or potential injury to a client.”<br>
Standard 7.2 provides “[s]uspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer 
knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a 
professional, and causes injury or potentially serious injury to a client, the 
public, or the legal system.”</p>
<p><a name="fn5">5</a> On December 13, 1995, respondent was admonished for 
neglecting a succession matter, attempting to cover up his misconduct by 
misrepresenting facts to his client, failing to refund an unearned fee and 
failing to cooperate with the ODC. <i>In re: Whitehead</i>, 95-ADB-085 
(12/13/95).</p>
<p><a name="fn6">6 </a>Respondent was admitted to the practice of law for 
approximately ten years at the time of misconduct.</p>
<p><a name="fn7">7 </a>In support of his character and reputation, respondent 
offered correspondence from Sarah Campbell, Executive Director of the Kitsatchie 
Legal Services Corporation (“KLSC”), a legal entity formed for the purpose of 
providing legal services to the indigent in the Natchitoches area. The letter 
provided respondent was recognized as the Pro Bono Attorney of the Year on two 
occasions. Moreover, it stated respondent was on KLSC’s Board of Directors for 
two years during which time he was an “exemplary” and “very active member of the 
Board, conscientiously attending meetings” and “demonstrating a concern and 
empathy for those less fortunate.”</p>
<p><a name="fn8">8 </a>Notably, restitution is not due to Ms. Valrie. Several 
years after she filed her disciplinary complaint, Ms. Valrie’s bank refunded the 
$150 filing fee to her since the cashier’s check directed to respondent was 
never negotiated.</p>
<p><a name="fn9">9</a> One of the conditions is that respondent render an 
accounting and make restitution to Ms. Cadwallader. By motion filed in this 
court, respondent sought to supplement the record to provide evidence of 
restitution. We decline to amend the record of these proceedings and instead 
direct respondent to submit this evidence to the ODC, which may then determine 
whether respondent has adequately complied with the condition of accounting and 
restitution.<br>
