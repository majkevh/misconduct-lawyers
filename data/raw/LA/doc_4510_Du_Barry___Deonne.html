<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">This disciplinary proceeding arises from one count of formal charges 
instituted by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, 
Deonne DuBarry, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<h3>Ratcliff Settlement</h3>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">In October 1984, respondent and her then-husband and law partner, Earl 
Boydell, Jr.,<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn1"><font size="1">1</font></a></span> filed a wrongful death and survival action on behalf of their 
client, Cynthia Ratcliff, personally and on behalf of her two year-old son, 
arising out of the death of Mrs. Ratcliff’s husband. In October 1985, a 
settlement was confected whereby Mrs. Ratcliff received $225,000 in cash, to be 
paid immediately (the “cash portion”), and a deferred portion which was placed 
into an annuity (the “structured portion”).</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Because the firm had not previously handled a structured settlement, Mr. 
Boydell and respondent were unsure how to calculate the 40% contingency fee due 
the firm under its agreement with Mrs. Ratcliff. Rather than consulting with an 
expert on structured settlements to determine the actual value of the deferred 
payments as recommended by the defendant’s counsel, Mr. Boydell telephoned his 
certified public accountant (“CPA”) to discuss the value of the settlement. The 
CPA advised Mr. Boydell that without knowing either the applicable interest rate 
or the cost of the annuity, he could only calculate a range of present-day 
values based upon various interest rates.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">At a meeting conducted on November 5, 1985, which was not attended by 
respondent,<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn2"><font size="1">2</font></a></span> Mr. Boydell disbursed a check to Mrs. Ratcliff in the amount of 
$72,782.50 representing her share of the settlement. From the cash portion, Mr. 
Boydell had deducted attorney’s fees in the amount of $90,000 and costs in the 
amount of $17,217.50. In addition, he also deducted an additional $45,000 in 
attorney’s fees which he charged on the structured portion, based upon his own 
general estimation that the annuity had a present-day value of $112,500.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">While there was no dispute concerning the attorney’s fees charged on the cash 
portion, the actual cost of the annuity was only $49,465, and a 40% attorney’s 
fee on the structured portion should have been less than $20,000. Therefore, two 
weeks following the disbursement, Mrs. Ratcliff wrote a letter directed to Mr. 
Boydell questioning the calculation of the attorney’s fees on the structured 
portion. The following day, Mr. Boydell forwarded a letter to Mrs. Ratcliff 
attesting to the accuracy of the calculation and misrepresenting that it was 
based on information from the legal and financial experts involved in the 
wrongful death litigation. When respondent learned Mrs. Ratcliff was questioning 
the fee calculation, she simply relied on Mr. Boydell’s assertion that he was 
handling the problem. Respondent did not consult an expert on structured 
settlements regarding the accuracy of the calculation.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Mrs. Ratcliff subsequently retained a new attorney, Dawn Barrios, who 
forwarded to Mr. Boydell a report from an economist estimating the cost of Mrs. 
Ratcliff’s annuity was $44,900. Relying on the report, Ms. Barrios sought a 
refund from the DuBarry &amp; Boydell Law Firm of more than $25,000 in attorney’s 
fees charged on the structured portion. Rather than properly addressing the 
dispute, Mr. Boydell sent a letter to Mrs. Ratcliff informing her that because 
she had “decided to look ‘a gift-horse in the mouth’” by retaining new counsel, 
the firm was billing her $14,244 for legal services performed incidental to the 
wrongful death suit. </p>
<h3>Fee Dispute and Defamation Litigation</h3>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">On June 23, 1986, Mrs. Ratcliff filed suit against respondent, Mr. Boydell 
and their firm to recover the disputed attorney’s fees. Cynthia Ledet Ratcliff, 
et al. v. Earl M. J. Boydell, Jr. and Deonne DuBarry d/b/a DuBarry &amp; Boydell, 
and DuBarry &amp; Boydell, APLC, No. 86-11313 c/w 86-15175, 86-19056, and 90-2303 on 
the docket of the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans. Over the next 
several years respondent and Mr. Boydell filed innumerable pleadings, consisting 
of bad faith and meritless motions, reconventional demands and appeals, in an 
effort to harass and intimidate Mrs. Ratcliff and Ms. Barrios. Mrs. Ratcliff in 
turn sought damages and sanctions for these abusive litigation tactics. </p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">One of the defenses raised by respondent was that she was not responsible for 
the abusive pleadings, which she claimed were filed by Mr. Boydell without her 
authorization. In rejecting this argument, the trial judge stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">[Ms. DuBarry] specifically alleged that Mr. Boydell filed most, if not all, 
of the pleadings in this matter up to trial and that she did not authorize him 
to sign her name to a number of the pleadings. She admitted that she did not 
until just prior to the trial specifically demand that he not sign her name to 
the pleadings. . . Ms. DuBarry conceded that she took no personal affirmative 
actions to settle the fee dispute short of allowing Mr. Boydell to handle the 
matter. </p>
<p align="justify">* * * </p>
<p align="justify">The record reflects that at all relevant times herein, Earl Boydell had the 
implicit, if not explicit, authority of DuBarry to initiate the multitude of 
pleadings filed. . .</p>
<p align="justify">For these reasons, the court holds that Deonne DuBarry and Earl M. J. Boydell, 
Jr. are jointly, severally and solidarily liable for all actions in which 
DuBarry and Boydell are cast in judgment. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">The trial judge then rendered judgment in favor of Mrs. Ratcliff and awarded 
Mrs. Ratcliff $25,214 in disputed attorney’s fees. He also sanctioned respondent 
and Mr. Boydell $43,000 for abuse of process, $12,000 for unethical practices, 
fraud and conversion and $18,000 for intentional infliction of emotional 
distress. In discussing the latter claim, the trial judge wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Considering the foregoing law in light of the facts of this case, the court 
finds that plaintiff has sustained her burden of proving an intentional tort by 
defendants. It is further felt that DuBarry and Boydell’s vindictive, 
obstreperous, and dilatory tactics over the six year course of this litigation 
amounted to nothing short of extreme and outrageous conduct against this 
plaintiff. They launched a counterattack against Ratcliff and Barrios by filing 
million dollar defamation suits against plaintiff, her attorney, and her 
attorney’s husband. Over the course of this self-protracted litigation, DuBarry 
and Boydell admittedly falsely sued Ratcliff for additional attorneys’ fees not 
owed; they, without due diligence, used a private process server calculated to 
intentionally upset plaintiff by serving her at home and work rather than 
through her attorney of record; they obstinately refused to answer Ratcliff’s 
petition, in an attempt to wear her down, for nearly three and one half (3½) 
years and then took a devolutive appeal from a court order to answer; and they 
frivolously filed motions, exceptions, third-party and reconventional demands 
(for many of which article 863 sanctions were awarded), devolutive appeals, 
unwarranted requests to stay proceedings, and other delaying requests too 
numerous to state.</p>
<p align="justify">When one considers the fact that none of defendants’ counter-actions were 
found to be meritorious, or were based upon informed advice of competent experts 
or counsel, such vile conduct is indeed so extreme or outrageous as to go beyond 
all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as utterly intolerable in a 
civilized community. The long history of intimidating tactics, multitudinous 
pleadings, and unwarranted delays reveal a clear and convincing pattern of 
deliberate, repeated harassment over a period in excess of six years. These 
extreme actions obviate any bona fide legal privilege DuBarry and Boydell may 
have enjoyed. . . . [T]he evidence is uncontroverted that plaintiff was 
particulary susceptible to emotional distress and that DuBarry and Boydell had 
knowledge of such susceptibility. Furthermore, by his own admission, Earl 
Boydell indicated that he intended to cause plaintiff some degree of distress. 
When viewed in its totality, this court finds that DuBarry’s and Boydell’s 
conduct amounted to more than a lesser degree of fright, humiliation, 
embarrassment or worry. Their conduct can only be classified as extreme and 
outrageous conduct intended or calculated to cause Ratcliff severe emotional 
distress. [emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Respondent and Mr. Boydell appealed the trial court’s judgment. On appeal, 
respondent again argued she was not directly involved in this case, but that Mr. 
Boydell alone handled everything. In affirming the trial court’s judgment, the 
court of appeal squarely rejected respondent’s contention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">First and foremost, the contingent fee contract whose breach is the basis of 
this suit was with her and Boydell. She was an obligor under that contract. If 
she delegated her duties to Boydell this did not relieve her of her obligation 
to plaintiff. Second, while Boydell was not the principal actor in the 
mishandling of the fee, she knew that a dispute existed and did nothing to 
resolve it. She was present at the November 5 meeting,<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn3"><font size="1">3</font></a></span> she participated in some 
of the court hearings and depositions, and she allowed Boydell to sign her name 
to pleadings. Finally, this court's opinion in Ratcliff v. Boydell, 540 So. 2d 
537 (La. App. 4th Cir. 1989), writ denied, 546 So. 2d 175 (La. 1989) 
demonstrates greater participation by Du Barry than she claims. [footnote added]</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
<span class="CITE">Ratcliff v. Boydell, 93 0362 (La. App. 4th Cir. 4/3/96), 674 So. 2d 272, 281</span>.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Thereafter, respondent paid Mrs. Ratcliff $185,000 and obtained a release 
from her. </p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">On June 10, 1992, Mrs. Ratcliff and Ms. Barrios filed a complaint against 
respondent with the ODC.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn4"><font size="1">4</font></a></span> Following a lengthy investigation, the ODC instituted 
one count of formal charges against respondent, alleging that respondent’s 
conduct violated numerous provisions of both the Code of Professional 
Responsibility, which was in effect until January 1, 1987, and the Rules of 
Professional Conduct.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn5"><font size="1">5</font></a></span> Specifically, the charges alleged respondent failed to 
properly advise her client regarding legal matters, misrepresented the cost of 
the annuity, retained an excessive fee, failed to adequately account for legal 
fees, failed to properly hold those fees in trust, failed to supervise the 
actions of her partner and employee, knowingly assisted her partner in engaging 
in misconduct, commingled and converted client funds, filed bad faith and meritless claims and engaged in conduct involving fraud and misrepresentation.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Respondent filed an answer denying any misconduct on her part. Specifically, 
she alleged she played no role in the disbursement of the settlement funds. 
Although she admitted to filing a suit for defamation against her former client, 
respondent argued that “Mr. Boydell filed other claims and/or suits against Mrs. 
Ratcliff, as to which [respondent] had no control, was not a party, had limited 
knowledge and/or was not responsible.” In support, respondent asserted that 
approximately one year after suit was filed, she severed her professional 
relationship with Mr. Boydell. Although she conceded he continued to represent 
her in the litigation, she maintained she was unaware of his abusive litigation 
tactics until two months prior to trial. Based on respondent’s answer, the 
matter proceeded to a formal hearing.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn6"><font size="1">6</font></a></span></p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:98-DB-010.HC --#">Hearing Committee Recommendation
</a> </h3>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">In its written findings and recommendation, the hearing committee concluded 
respondent had no direct knowledge of the magnitude of the animosity involved in 
the litigation since Mr. Boydell signed respondent’s name to many pleadings 
without her consent or knowledge, and that she had only limited involvement in 
the suits after the initial filings. Further, the hearing committee concluded 
that since respondent relied on Mr. Boydell’s calculation of the fee, she did 
not fail to properly advise Mrs. Ratcliff on the matter or retain a clearly 
excessive fee as defined by the Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Nonetheless, the hearing committee determined respondent did engage in 
professional misconduct. First, the committee concluded respondent failed to 
place the disputed portion of the fee in trust when she learned Mrs. Ratcliff 
had filed suit against respondent’s firm contesting the fee calculation. Next, 
it found respondent breached her duty to refrain from filing suit, asserting a 
position, conducting a defense, delaying a trial or taking any other actions 
which she knew, or which should have been obvious to her, were designed merely 
to harass or maliciously injure her client. The committee recognized that the 
mere fact that the litigation spanned in excess of ten years should have been an 
indicator to respondent that the litigation was causing harm to her former 
client and to the legal system.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Based on these findings, the committee concluded respondent intentionally 
engaged in conduct which violated a duty to her client, to the public and to the 
legal profession. Relying on jurisprudence from this court, the committee 
determined the baseline sanction was suspension. As an aggravating factor, the 
hearing committee recognized respondent’s prior disciplinary record.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn7"><font size="1">7</font></a></span> In 
mitigation, it noted the presence of the mitigating factors asserted by 
respondent,<span style="vertical-align: super"><font size="1"><a href="#fn8">8</a></font></span> as well as the delay in the disciplinary process. Accordingly, the 
hearing committee recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of 
law for a period of six months.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Both respondent and the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee’s 
findings and recommendation. </p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:98-DB-010.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">The disciplinary board accepted the hearing committee’s findings of fact, but 
deviated from the committee’s conclusions of law. While the board dismissed 
numerous charges on the basis that the ODC had failed to prove them by clear and 
convincing evidence,<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn9"><font size="1">9</font></a></span> it concluded there was sufficient evidence to support 
professional misconduct on the part of respondent.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn10"><font size="1">10</font></a></span> Like the committee, the 
board found respondent had a duty to refrain from taking any legal action which 
she knew, or which should have been obvious to her after ten years of 
litigation, was merely designed to maliciously injure her client. The board 
concluded that when respondent became aware of a fee dispute after the funds 
were disbursed, she failed to comply with her obligation to promptly pay her 
client the portion of the fee the client was entitled to receive. </p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">In addressing the issue of sanctions, the board determined respondent 
violated duties owed to her clients, the public and the profession. Moreover, it 
found she acted intentionally and caused actual injury to her client, the public 
and the profession. Like the committee, it recognized respondent’s prior 
disciplinary record as the only aggravating factor.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn11"><font size="1">11</font></a></span> As mitigating factors, the 
board noted the presence of personal or emotional problems, cooperative attitude 
toward the disciplinary proceedings, prior good character and reputation,<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn12"><font size="1">12</font></a></span> 
delay in the disciplinary process and imposition of other penalties or 
sanctions.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">The board relied on Standards 4.12, 6.21 and 7.1 of the ABA’s 
<i>Standards for 
Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>,<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn13"><font size="1">13</font></a></span> as well as jurisprudence from this court.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn14"><font size="1">14</font></a></span> Finding 
the mitigating factors should be given great weight, the board deviated downward 
from the committee’s recommendation to propose a six-month suspension, with 
three months deferred.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">The ODC filed an objection to the leniency of the board’s proposed sanction, 
and the matter was set on the court’s docket for oral argument pursuant to 
Supreme Court Rule XIX, § <a href="#!-- #ID:r19s11G --#">11</a>(G)(1)(b).</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that respondent’s misconduct 
in this matter falls into two distinct categories: (1) her initial handling of 
the fee dispute and (2) her conduct during the subsequent civil litigation over 
the fee. </p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">As to the fee dispute, we agree that respondent did not personally calculate 
the fee in the structured settlement which was done by Mr. Boydell. Nonetheless, 
the record reveals respondent was aware that Mr. Boydell had never calculated an 
attorney’s fee from a structured settlement. Once Mrs. Ratcliff raised questions 
concerning the fee, respondent knowingly failed to comply with her duty under 
Rule <span class="Rules">1.5</span> to make an effort to amicably resolve the dispute and protect her 
client’s interests. Rather, the record reveals she neglected to place the 
disputed funds in trust and failed to undertake any measures to conduct an 
independent investigation into the fee calculation.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">As to the subsequent litigation over the fee, the record demonstrates in a 
convincing fashion that respondent had direct knowledge of Mr. Boydell’s 
mishandling of their defense and, in fact, facilitated his vexatious tactics and 
strategy for ten years. Even accepting respondent’s contention that Mr. Boydell 
was responsible for these pleadings, the fact remains that respondent knew her 
name appeared on each of the pleadings, not only as a party to the litigation, 
but also as counsel. It is further undisputed respondent did not, at any time in 
the few months prior to the civil trial, advise the court, Mr. Boydell or 
opposing counsel that she had an objection to Mr. Boydell’s signing her name to 
the pleadings or that he lacked the authority to do so. In addition, respondent 
attended many, if not most, of the depositions conducted in the litigation, as 
well as innumerable hearings through the years on the hundreds of motions filed 
by Mr. Boydell on their behalf. None of these motions were found to be 
meritorious or based upon informed advice of competent experts or counsel. Given 
these facts, it defies logic for respondent to suggest she was somehow unaware 
of the abusive litigation tactics perpetuated in this case for over a decade.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Having found misconduct on the part of respondent, we now turn to the 
appropriate sanction for that misconduct. In determining an appropriate 
sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain 
high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the 
profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 
So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of 
each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of 
any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. 
Whittington</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">We find respondent’s misconduct serious in nature. Respondent knew the 
calculated use of the vindictive defense tactics, employed in part on her behalf 
by Mr. Boydell, was intended to cause Mrs. Ratcliff severe emotional distress. 
While successful in this respect, these abusive actions also negatively impacted 
Mrs. Ratcliff’s minor son, who was two years old at the time of the wrongful 
death settlement stemming from the death of his father, and twelve years old at 
the conclusion of the fee dispute litigation. During this ten year period, Mrs. 
Ratcliff was intentionally led to believe that she would lose the entire 
wrongful death settlement award, which was intended to benefit her son. As a 
result, she felt constrained to not spend any of the settlement, although she 
was, at times, in dire need of the funds. Likewise, the legal system and 
profession were harmed through respondent’s frivolous and dilatory abuse of the 
legal process. As noted by the trial court, respondent’s “vile conduct [was] 
indeed so extreme or outrageous as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency 
and to be regarded as utterly intolerable in a civilized community.” Most 
troubling is respondent’s exhibition of a complete indifference for the 
emotional distress inflicted on her client for a decade.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">In the context of Mr. Boydell’s disciplinary proceeding, we concluded the 
baseline sanction for perpetuation of vexatious litigation is disbarment, 
although we ultimately imposed a three-year suspension in that case in light of 
the mitigating factors. <span class="CITE"> <i>Boydell</i>, 00-0086 at p. 8, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:760%20So.2d%20326 --#">760 So. 2d at 332</a></span>. In 
formulating an appropriate sanction for respondent’s misconduct, we find her 
degree of culpability for the institution of this vexatious litigation is less 
than that of Mr. Boydell, though it is still significant. Several mitigating 
factors are present, including respondent’s personal and emotional problems 
during the time period in question, her cooperative attitude toward the 
disciplinary proceedings, her good character and reputation, and the imposition 
of other penalties and sanctions in connection with the civil litigation. In 
addition, we recognize the disciplinary proceedings were somewhat delayed in 
this matter, though the delay is more attributable to the procedural complexity 
of the case rather than any deficiency of the disciplinary system.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Having considered these factors, we conclude a downward departure from the 
baseline sanction is appropriate. Accordingly, we will suspend respondent from 
the practice of law for a period of one year.</p>
<p align="center"><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and 
disciplinary board, and considering the record, briefs and oral argument, it is 
ordered that Deonne DuBarry be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana 
for a period of one year. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed 
against respondent in accordance with <span class="AllRules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1</span>, 
with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of the finality of 
this court’s judgment until paid.</p>
