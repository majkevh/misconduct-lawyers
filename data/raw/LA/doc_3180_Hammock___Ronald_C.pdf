  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: RONALD HAMMOCK</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 00-DB-148</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE"><b> RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</b></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a Joint Petition for Consent Discipline
  (herein "Petition") by the respondent, Ronald Hammock (herein "Respondent"), of Covington, Louisiana, and the Office
  of Disciplinary Counsel (herein "ODC") prior to the filing of formal charges. The Board accepts the Petition and
  orders a public reprimand be issued against Respondent.</p>

  <h2><b>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On November 27, 2000, Respondent and ODC filed a Joint Petition for Consent Discipline and
  Stipulation of Facts. On the same day, ODC filed a Memorandum in Support of Sanction. Formal charges have not been
  filed in this matter. On February 22, 2001, a panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed the documents filed in this
  matter.</p>

  <h2><b>STIPULATED FACTS</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The stipulation of facts in this matter read as follows:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">"Respondent was certified ineligible to practice law by the Louisiana Supreme Court in 1993 due
  to non-payment of Louisiana State Bar Association membership dues and non-compliance with mandatory continuing legal
  education requirements. Even though he was ineligible to practice law, Respondent accepted an offer to be placed on
  the court's curator list in St. Tammany Parish. On August 11, 2000, Respondent was appointed curator to represent the
  interests of the absent defendant in the matter entitled <i>Bank One, Louisiana, N.A. v. Robert Vierling</i>,
  22<sup>nd</sup> Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Tammany, Case No. 2000-11882, Division B. On August 21,
  2000, after discovering that Respondent had been declared ineligible to practice law, the attorney for the plaintiff
  moved to have Respondent removed as curator and to have a new curator appointed. On August 23, 2000, the judge
  ordered the recission of Respondent's appointment as curator and appointed another attorney as curator."</p>

  <h2><b>PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> <span class="allegedrules">5.5(a)</span><a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" class="fn"
  id="_ednref1">[i]</a> and Rule <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span><a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn"
  id="_ednref2">[ii]</a> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent tenders a conditional admission to the
  misconduct, and the parties propose that a sanction of public reprimand be imposed.</p>

  <h2><b>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">5.5(a) and 8.4(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The Board must accept that Respondent has
  violated these rules. <span class="cite"><i>In re Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96);
  <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given the violations of these rules, the Board is
  left to determine if the proposed sanction of public reprimand is appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system,
  or to the profession;</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's acceptance of a curator appointment at a time when he was ineligible to practice law
  and his violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct violated duties owed as a professional. The facts in the
  Petition provide no specific information regarding Respondent's mental state relevant to his misconduct. However,
  based upon the definitions provided in the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> (herein "Standard"),
  Respondent's actions were knowing, if not intentional.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" class="fn"
  id="_ednref3">[iii]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The potential for injury existed once Respondent accepted a curator appointment at a time when he
  knew he was ineligible to practice law. In its Memorandum, ODC asserts that Respondent's actions did not result in
  any injury to the client, the public, or the legal system. However, this was due to the intervention of a third party
  and not by any action taken by Respondent. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the Petition, the parties agree that the mitigating factors of Standard 9.32(a)
  (<span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>), Standard 9.32(c)
  (<span class="ABAstandard">personal or emotional problems</span>), Standard 9.32(e) (<span class="ABAstandard">full
  and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings</span>), and Standard 9.32(l)
  (<span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>) apply. No aggravating factors are listed in the Petition. The record
  supports the recognition of the mitigating factors of absence of a prior disciplinary record, cooperative attitude
  toward the proceedings, and remorse, as well as the absence of any aggravating factors. However, except for ODC's
  assertion, there is not anything in the record to support the recognition that the mitigating factor of personal or
  emotional problems is present in this matter.</p>

  <h2> <b>ANALYSIS</b></h2>

  <h3><b>I.</b> ABA Standards</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanction</i>
  (herein "Standard") to determine the baseline sanction by "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's mental state and
  the extent of the injury caused; and then adjust the sanction in accordance with the aggravating and mitigating
  factors present." <span class="cite"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94);
  <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 350</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC cites Standard 7.3 in support of the proposed sanction. Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">7.3</span> provides for reprimand when "a lawyer negligently engages in conduct that is a
  violation of a duty owed as a professional, and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, or the
  legal system." Conversely, Standard <span class="ABAstandard">7.2</span> provides for suspension when "a lawyer
  knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional, and causes injury or potential
  injury to a client, the public, or the legal system."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As noted above Respondent's actions in this matter were knowing. However, the Commentary to
  Standard 7.3 states, "Reprimand is the appropriate sanction in most cases of a violation of a duty owed as a
  professional. Usually there is little or no injury to a client, the public, or the legal system, and the purposes of
  lawyer discipline will be best served by imposing a public sanction that helps educate the respondent lawyer and
  deters future violations." This matter appears to fall within the parameters recognized by the Commentary.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon the ABA guidelines, suspension or reprimand is an appropriate sanction for
  Respondent's violation of Rule 5.5(a) and Rule 8.4(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3><b>II.</b> Relevant Case Law</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> The Board also looks to relevant case law for assistance in determining an appropriate sanction
  for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Recent Louisiana cases involving the unauthorized practice of
  law during periods of ineligibility have resulted in suspensions or disbarment. However, unlike the instant matter,
  these cases involved additional rule violations.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" class="fn"
  id="_ednref4">[iv]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon these cases, a suspension is an appropriate baseline sanction for an attorney's
  unauthorized practice of law during periods of ineligibility when other misconduct is present. However, they offer
  little guidance concerning the appropriateness of a public reprimand as a sanction for an attorney's unauthorized
  practice of law during periods of ineligibility when other misconduct is not present.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Research of attorney disciplinary cases in other states conducted thus far has also failed to
  reveal any cases that shed light on that particular subject. In a1988 opinion, the District of Columbia Court of
  Appeals did note that, "Taken alone, [a violation of Rule 5.5(a)] would ordinarily justify the milder sanction, if
  any, of an informal admonition, a censure, or a reprimand."<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" class="fn"
  id="_ednref5">[v]</a> <b> </b></p>

  <h3><b>III.</b> Conclusion</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon the ABA guidelines and the suggestive nature of prior disciplinary cases involving the
  unauthorized practice of law during periods of ineligibility, the proposed consent discipline of a public reprimand
  is the appropriate sanction for Respondent's violation of Rules <span class="Rules">5.5(a)</span> and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2><b> RULING</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the petition for consent discipline be accepted, and
  that a public reprimand be issued against the respondent, Ronald Hammock. It is further ordered that Respondent be
  assessed the costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the
  date of finality of this ruling until paid.</p>
