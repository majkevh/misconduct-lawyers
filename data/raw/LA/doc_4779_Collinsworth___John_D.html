  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: JOHN D. COLLINSWORTH</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from two counts of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, John D. Collinsworth, a disbarred attorney.</p>

  <h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Prior to addressing the instant misconduct, we find it helpful to review respondent's
  disciplinary history.  Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in Louisiana in 1977.  In 1991, respondent was
  admonished by the disciplinary board for failing to cooperate with the ODC in a disciplinary investigation. 
  Beginning in July 1998, and continuing through at least April 1999, respondent converted funds from his law firm's
  operating and client trust accounts.  The law firm filed a complaint against respondent in July 1999, but respondent
  failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the matter.  We disbarred respondent for his conduct on
  September 21, 2001.  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Collinsworth</i>, 01-1628 (La. 9/21/01),
  <a href="2001-09-21_2001-1628.htm">795 So. 2d 312</a></span>.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On May 20, 2000, Terry Greer paid respondent $500 to represent him in a divorce proceeding. 
  Respondent did some work on the case, but failed to complete the representation and failed to communicate with his
  client concerning the matter.  He also failed to promptly refund the unearned portion of the legal fee Mr. Greer
  paid.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In May 2001, Mr. Greer filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC.  On June 19, 2001, and
  again on July 11, 2001, the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail.  Respondent failed
  to reply to the complaint.  The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on
  September 4, 2001 and answer the complaint under oath.  Respondent failed to appear.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On February 13, 2002, the ODC filed two counts of formal charges against respondent, alleging
  that his conduct in the Greer matter violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a
  client), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a client),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.5(f)(6)</span> (failure to refund an unearned fee),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> (termination of the representation),
  <span class="allegedrules">3.4(c)</span> (knowing disobedience of an obligation under the rules of a tribunal),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or
  misrepresentation), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation).  The ODC further alleged that respondent's knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand for
  information from a disciplinary authority constituted a violation of Supreme Court <span class="allegedrules">Rule
  XIX, § 9(c)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges.  Accordingly, the factual
  allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3).  No formal hearing was held, but the parties were given an opportunity to file with the
  hearing committee written arguments and documentary evidence on the issue of sanctions.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2003-05-02_02-DB-019.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">After consideration of the ODC's submission in response to the deemed admitted
  order,<a name="_ftnref1" class="fn" href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">1</a> the committee found respondent was retained by
  Mr. Greer and that he failed to communicate with him, failed to plead his case, and failed to return the unearned
  fee, in violation of Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4</span>,
  <span class="Rules">1.5(f)(6)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span> of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct.  The committee also noted respondent's failure to cooperate with the ODC and
  failure to respond to the formal charges.  The committee determined that respondent violated duties owed to his
  client and as a professional, and that Mr. Greer suffered actual injury.  The committee found no mitigating factors
  are present but noted in aggravation that respondent has a prior history of similar disciplinary violations.  Under
  these circumstances, the committee recommended that respondent be disbarred, to run consecutively with his prior
  disbarment.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-01-16_02-DB-019.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Noting the factual allegations of the formal charges were deemed admitted and proven by clear and
  convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3), the disciplinary board agreed that respondent
  violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged.  The board determined that respondent knowingly violated
  duties owed to his client and as a professional.  Respondent caused damage to his client by failing to complete the
  divorce and by failing to return the advanced fee that he did not earn.  His failure to cooperate in the disciplinary
  investigation resulted in the issuance of a subpoena and caused unnecessary delay and expense as well as damage to
  the profession.  Based on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> and the prior jurisprudence, the
  baseline sanction for this misconduct is a suspension from the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The board found prior <span class="ABAstandard">disciplinary offenses</span> and a
  <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span> are aggravating factors.  The board made no finding concerning
  mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Concluding respondent's present and prior misconduct constitute "serious attorney misconduct," as
  that term is defined by <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 9</span> of this court's permanent disbarment
  guidelines,<a name="_ftnref2" class="fn" href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">2</a> the board recommended that respondent be
  permanently disbarred. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board's recommendation, but on our
  own motion, we ordered the parties to submit briefs addressing the issue of an appropriate sanction.  Both respondent
  and the ODC filed briefs in response to the order.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The deemed admitted facts in this case support a finding that respondent neglected a legal
  matter, failed to communicate with his client, failed to promptly refund an unearned legal fee, and failed to
  cooperate with the ODC in its investigation.  We note, however, that this misconduct occurred during the same general
  time frame as the misconduct forming the basis of respondent's disbarment in <i>Collinsworth I</i>.  In
  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain</i>, <a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 So. 2d
  470</a> (La. 1991)</span>, we observed that it is generally inappropriate to disbar a previously disbarred attorney
  when the misconduct at issue occurred before or concurrently with the violations that resulted in the initial
  disbarment.  Rather, when a second disciplinary proceeding involves misconduct that occurred during the same time
  frame as the first proceeding, the overall discipline to be imposed should be determined as if both proceedings were
  before the court simultaneously.  Applying this procedure in the <i>Chatelain</i> case, we adjudged the respondent
  guilty of additional violations warranting disbarment which were added to his record for consideration in the event
  he applied for readmission after becoming eligible to do so.  <i>See also</i> <span class="cite"><i>In re:
  Patrick</i>, 01-1419 (La. 3/15/02), <a href="2002-03-15_2001-1419.htm">815 So. 2d 804</a></span>;
  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Gros</i>, 98-0772 (La. 3/15/02), <a href="2002-03-15_1998-0772.htm">815 So. 2d
  799</a></span>; <span class="cite"><i>In re: Parker</i>, 00-3532 (La. 3/15/02),
  <a href="2002-03-15_2001-3532.htm">815 So. 2d 794</a></span>. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction in the instant case, we find the approach of
  <i>Chatelain</i> is instructive.  Accordingly, our determination of a sanction will be based upon the appropriate
  sanction we would have imposed if these charges had been before the court at the same time as the charges in
  <i>Collinsworth I</i>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent suggests in brief that the misconduct at issue in the prior proceeding was far more
  serious than the single matter at issue here, and hence his punishment would not have been any different if these
  formal charges had been part of <i>Collinsworth I</i>.  We agree.  While we do not minimize the seriousness of
  respondent's mishandling of Mr. Greer's divorce case, that misconduct pales in comparison to respondent's intentional
  conversion of funds from his law firm's operating and client trust accounts.  There is nothing in the record before
  us to suggest that a sanction greater than disbarment would have been imposed if the two counts of formal charges
  arising out of the Greer matter had been added to the formal charges in the earlier proceeding.  Therefore, as in
  <i>Chatelain</i>, we will adjudge respondent guilty of additional violations which warrant disbarment and which will
  be added to his record for consideration in the event he applies for readmission after becoming eligible to do
  so.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record and the briefs filed by the parties, it is ordered that John D. Collinsworth be adjudged
  guilty of additional violations which warrant disbarment and which may be considered in the event he applies for
  readmission from his disbarment in <i>In re: Collinsworth</i>, 01-1628 (La. 9/21/01),
  <a href="2001-09-21_2001-1628.htm">795 So. 2d 312</a>, after becoming eligible to do so.  All costs and expenses in
  the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to
  commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
