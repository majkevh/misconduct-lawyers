<br>

<p class="bodycopy">This disciplinary proceeding
arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”)
against respondent, Leonard O. Parker, Jr.</p>
<h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">On January 24, 1997, we disbarred
respondent for commingling and conversion of client funds and failure to
cooperate with ODC. <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Parker</i>, 96-2697 c/w 96-2698 (La. 1/24/97),
<a href="#!-- #ID:687%20So.2d%2096 --#">687 So. 2d 96</a></span> (hereinafter referred to
as <i>Parker I</i>). This decision became final upon denial of rehearing on
March 14, 1997.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">On January 30, 1998, we again
disbarred respondent from the practice of law stemming from four counts of
misconduct involving destruction of criminal evidence, neglect of legal matters,
failure to refund and account for unearned fees, commingling and conversion of
client funds and failure to cooperate. <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Parker</i>, 97-2351
(La.1/30/98), <a href="#!-- #ID:705%20So.2d%20736 --#">705 So. 2d 736</a> </span>(hereinafter referred to as <i>Parker II</i>.)</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">The instant matter arises from
respondent’s representation of Mary Wheeler. In November 1996, Ms. Wheeler was
sued by an individual who alleged he had been bitten by a dog owned by her. On
January 7, 1996, Ms. Wheeler retained respondent to represent her in the case.
Respondent advised Ms. Wheeler his fee for representing her in the matter would
be $1,000. Ms. Wheeler paid respondent $500 towards his $1,000 fee. Other than
filing an answer on Ms. Wheeler’s behalf, respondent took no action in the case.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Shortly thereafter, on January 24,
1997, we rendered our opinion in <i>Parker I</i>, disbarring respondent from the
practice of law. Respondent filed an application for rehearing from that
decision. While respondent’s application for rehearing was pending in this
court, respondent met with Ms. Wheeler and requested an additional $127 from her
for filing fees in her case. He failed to advise her that he was in jeopardy of
losing his license to practice law.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">On March 12, 1997, respondent
accepted a $500 fee from Ms. Wheeler in connection with a separate legal matter
involving Ms. Wheeler’s granddaughter. Meanwhile, on March 14, 1997, this court
denied rehearing in <i>Parker I</i>, and respondent’s disbarment became
effective.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">On March 17, 1997, respondent sent
a letter to Ms. Wheeler indicating he was withdrawing from representing her in
both the dog bite case and the matter involving her granddaughter. The letter
failed to mention respondent had been disbarred from practice, and simply
stated:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">Please contact me upon receipt of this letter to discuss the
 reasons for these actions and a refund of the unearned fees in this matter. I
 sincerely apologize for having to take this action and wish you well in your
 endeavors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="bodycopy">Thereafter, Ms. Wheeler retained
other counsel, Raymond Ward, who negotiated a settlement in the dog bite case.
Mr. Ward then wrote to respondent on two occasions regarding the unearned fees.
When respondent failed to reply, Mr. Ward filed a suit against respondent on
behalf of Ms. Wheeler in First City Court for the City of New Orleans seeking
the unearned fees.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Mr. Ward, on Ms. Wheeler’s behalf,
also filed a complaint with the ODC, alleging respondent failed to account for
or return the unearned fee. In support, the complaint alleged respondent failed
to perform any services on behalf of Ms. Wheeler in the two legal matters in
which he was retained to represent her, with the exception of the filing of a
one-page answer in the dog bite case.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed
formal charges against respondent, alleging respondent failed to refund an
unearned fee in violation of Rules <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.5 --#">1.5</a>(f)(6)</span>
and <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.16 --#">1.16</a>(d)</span>, and engaged in conduct involving
dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation, in violation of Rule
<span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(d)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.[<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a>]</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Respondent filed an answer to the
formal charges. He maintained he performed services on behalf of his client in
the dog bite case and that no fees were refundable.</p>
<h3>Formal Hearing</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">Respondent appeared at the
hearing. Although he did not testify on his own behalf, he cross-examined the
ODC’s witnesses. Ms. Wheeler testified she trusted respondent since he was a
reverend at a church she occasionally attended and that he never advised her at
any time that he had been the subject of disciplinary proceedings or that he had
been disbarred from practice. She stated that although she had paid respondent a
total of $1,127 in legal fees to handle both cases, she was unaware if he had
performed any legal services on her behalf. However, she did admit that they had
met on a few occasions to discuss the cases, which totaled 2.75 hours. Mr.
Ward’s testimony corroborated that of Ms. Wheeler.</p>
<h3>Hearing Committee Recommendation</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">The hearing committee concluded
respondent violated the professional rules as charged. Specifically, it found
respondent failed to refund the unearned fees even after acknowledging in
writing that he owed them, that he deceived his client by failing to inform her
that he was the subject of disciplinary proceedings, and undertook
representation of her in a new matter after the date of his disbarment. The
committee noted respondent breached the duties owed to his client, the public,
the legal system and the profession. Relying on the ABA’s <i>Standards for
Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>,[<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a>]
it concluded the baseline sanction is suspension. While it found no mitigating
factors to be present, the committee recognized that nine of the ten aggravating
factors are present, namely, prior disciplinary offenses, dishonest or selfish
motive, pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the
disciplinary proceeding by failing to comply with the rules of the disciplinary
agency, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, vulnerability
of the victim, substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted 1982),
and indifference to making restitution. Further, the committee noted in
aggravation that respondent<br>
violated <span class="AllRules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s26 --#">26</a>(E)</span> in
failing to refund the unearned fees within thirty days after entry of this
court’s earlier disbarment orders and in failing to refund the fees to date, and
violated <span class="AllRules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s26 --#">26</a>(G)</span> when he
undertook new legal matters between service of the order of disbarment and the
effective date of the discipline. Finally, the committee observed respondent’s
actions evidenced his “complete indifference to and total lack of respect for
the disciplinary system.”</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Based on these considerations, the
committee recommended respondent again be disbarred from practice. Recognizing
that respondent had already been disbarred on two prior occasions, the committee
found as a practical matter he could not be disbarred again. However, citing
<span class="CITE"> <i>
Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Krasnoff</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:502%20So.2d%201018 --#">502 So. 2d 1018</a> (La. 1987)</span>, the
board concluded this court has the authority to extend the minimum period which
must expire before respondent may apply for readmission. Moreover, the committee
noted that “if there were a convincing case for the adoption or introduction of
a permanent disbarment procedure in Louisiana, this is the case.”[<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a>]</p>
<h3>Disciplinary Board Recommendation</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board concurred
in the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee, and recommended
respondent be disbarred. Like the hearing committee, it found respondent’s
actions made a compelling case for the imposition of permanent disbarment.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC
filed objections to the recommendation of the disciplinary board, which was
filed in this court on December 28, 2000. However, in light of the board’s
recommendation that the court consider the imposition of permanent disbarment
under the egregious facts of this case, we deferred action on the case pending
our consideration of a rule relating to permanent disbarment.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">On August 1, 2001, after a lengthy
period of study and public comment, this court adopted amendments to Supreme
Court Rule XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s10 --#">10</a>[<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a>]
and §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s24 --#">24</a>[<a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a>]
to provide for the sanction of permanent disbarment. On September 13, 2001, we
ordered respondent and the ODC to brief the issue of whether permanent
disbarment should be imposed in this matter.[<a class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a>]
The order further provided that respondent could request oral argument in his
brief, and that if such a request was made, the case would be docketed;
otherwise, the matter would be considered only on the briefs. Respondent did not
file a brief.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">However, on October 3, 2001, two
attorneys potentially facing permanent disbarment filed a “Motion for Leave to
File <i>Amicus Curiae</i> Brief, for Oral Argument, and to Participate in Oral
Argument.” The amici asserted that they are in a similar posture to respondent
as their misconduct occurred prior to August 1, 2001, but the ODC will be
seeking to permanently disbar them.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Because of the unusual issues
presented in this case, we permitted the amici to file briefs and participate in
oral argument. At oral argument, the amici suggested that the permanent
disbarment rules could not operate retroactively because to do so would deprive
the respondent-attorney of the right to seek readmission, a right granted to him
at the time of the underlying misconduct. In opposition, the ODC argued that
this court always had discretion to foreclose a disbarred attorney from seeking
readmission, and contended the rule changes were merely guidelines by which the
court will exercise its discretion and authority.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Having considered the record of
the instant proceeding in light of the well-presented arguments of the amici and
the ODC, we now conclude that we need not resolve the issue of retroactivity of
the permanent disbarment rules in the context of the present facts.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">While the disciplinary board’s
recommendation that we consider the imposition of permanent disbarment in this
matter and our resulting decision to defer consideration of the matter were well
intentioned, our lengthy deliberations over the permanent disbarment rule
resulted in this case being held over two years. The resulting delay itself
presents a factor which must be considered. See Standard 9.32(i) of the ABA’s <i>
Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>;<span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Hand</i>, 00-3106 (La.
6/1/01), <a href="#!-- #ID:787%20So.2d%20294 --#">787 So. 2d 294</a></span>.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Most significantly, our review of
the record in this case reveals the misconduct in the instant case occurred
within the same time frame as the misconduct which formed the basis for
respondent’s disbarment in <i>Parker II</i>. In <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v.
Chatelain</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:573%20So.2d%20470 --#">573 So. 2d 470</a> (La.
1991)</span>, we observed that when the underlying conduct occurs within the same
period as the misconduct forming the basis for a previous disbarment, the
discipline imposed should be determined as if both proceedings were before the
court simultaneously. Applying this procedure in <i>Chatelain</i>, we declined
to extend the minimum period for readmission. Instead, we adjudged the
respondent guilty of additional violations which were added to his record for
consideration in the event he applied for readmission after becoming eligible to
do so.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">In determining an appropriate
sanction in the instant case, we believe the approach of <i>Chatelain</i> is
instructive. Accordingly, our determination of a sanction will be based upon the
appropriate sanction we would have imposed if these charges had been before the
court at the same time as the charges in respondent’s previous disciplinary
proceedings.[<a class="fn" href="#fn7">7</a>]</p>
<p class="bodycopy">As the hearing committee observed,
the baseline sanction for respondent’s actions in the instant case, had they
been considered in isolation, would probably be a suspension. However,
respondent’s actions in this case, combined with his similar conduct in both <i>
Parker I</i> and <i>Parker II</i>, demonstrates an overall pattern of lack of
concern for his clients’ welfare. Numerous aggravating factors are present. We
are unable to discern any mitigating factors from the record.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Had the instant charges been filed
simultaneously with those charges forming the basis of respondent’s earlier
disbarments, they would have only reinforced our view that respondent lacks the
moral fitness to practice law and must be disbarred, both as a sanction for his
misconduct and to protect the public. Therefore, as in <i>Chatelain</i>, we will
adjudge respondent guilty of additional violations which warrant disbarment and
which will be added to his record for consideration in the event he applies for
readmission after becoming eligible to do so. We further emphasize that although
respondent may have a procedural right to apply for readmission, this court
retains absolute discretion to grant or deny such an application. In light of
respondent’s lengthy history of egregious misconduct, this court will carefully
scrutinize any application for readmission with a critical eye.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">In sum, without passing on the
question of whether we could apply the permanent disbarment rules to this case,
we elect in our discretion to resolve this case under the principles set forth
in <i>Chatelain</i>. Accordingly, respondent is adjudged guilty of additional
violations which warrant disbarment and which will be added to his record for
consideration in the event he applies for readmission after becoming eligible to
do so.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">For the reasons assigned,
respondent, Leonard O. Parker, Jr., is adjudged guilty of additional violations&nbsp;
which warrant disbarment and which will be added to his record for consideration
in the event he applies for readmission after becoming eligible to do so. All
costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance
with Supreme Court Rule XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s10.1 --#">10.1</a>, with legal
interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s
judgment until paid.</p>
<hr>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> The formal charges originally included a second count
alleging respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the
Wheeler matter. However, at the formal hearing, the ODC dismissed this count.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> Standard 4.61 provides “[d]isbarment is generally
appropriate when a lawyer knowingly deceives a client with the intent to benefit
the lawyer or another, and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a
client.”</p>
<p class="footnotetext">Standard 6.22 provides “[s]uspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer
knows that he or she is violating a court order or rule, and causes injury or
potential injury to a client or a party, or causes interference or potential
interference with a legal proceeding.”</p>
<p class="footnotetext">Standard 7.2 provides “[s]uspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer
knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed to the
profession, and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client, the
public, or the legal system.”</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> One member of the committee wrote a concurrence
amplifying these sentiments and suggesting this court adopt a “Three Strikes
You’re Out Forever” policy regarding disbarment.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> Supreme Court Rule XIX, §10(A) was amended to add the
highlighted language:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify" class="footnotetext">(1) Disbarment by the court. <b>In any order or judgment of
 the court in which a lawyer is disbarred, the court retains the discretion to
 permanently disbar the lawyer and permanently prohibit any such lawyer from

</blockquote>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">5</a> Supreme Court Rule XIX, §24(A) was amended to add the
highlighted language:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify" class="footnotetext">A disbarred lawyer or a suspended lawyer who has served a
 suspension period of more than one year, exclusive of any waivers or periods of
 deferral, shall be reinstated or readmitted only upon order of the court. No
 lawyer may petition for reinstatement until six months before the period of
 suspension has expired. No lawyer may petition for readmission until five years
 after the effective date of disbarment. A lawyer who has been placed on interim
 suspension and is then disbarred for the same misconduct that was the ground
 for the interim suspension may petition for readmission at the expiration of
 five years from the time of the effective date of the interim suspension. <b>
 The court retains the discretion, in accordance with Section 10A of this rule,

should be interpreted as passing on whether we could or could not impose
permanent disbarment under these facts.</p>
