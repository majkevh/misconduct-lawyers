<br>
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>PER CURIAM*</p>

</p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">On April 25, 1996, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel filed two counts of formal charges against 'the respondent, Van H. Brass, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first count arose out of a complaint </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b>filed </b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">against respondent by his former client, Ms. Ruby Home.&nbsp; Respondent was retained to represent the three </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b>minor </b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">children of Ms. Home in personal injury claims.&nbsp; In March of 1990, respondent settled the claims and received settlement</font><font face='Times New Roman'> </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">drafts, which were deposited into a </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b>bank </b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">account labeled &quot;client trust account,&quot; but used by respondent as an operating account.&nbsp; Although respondent withheld funds from the settlements for payment of outstanding medical expenses to a physician and a hospital, he failed to pay the physician until August of 1990 and failed to pay the hospital until 1993.&nbsp; Since the issuance of the settlement drafts, the balance in respondent's &quot;client trust account&quot; often fell below the amount of funds necessary to pay the outstanding medical bills.&nbsp; Respondent also repeatedly wrote checks on the account which were returned for insufficient funds resulting in a charge to the account which further depleted the client funds.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite repeated requests by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel for a response to the complaint filed by Ms. Home, respondent failed to cooperate with the investigation and a subpoena had to be issued in February 1993 to compel respondent's testimony.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As to the second count of the formal charges, respondent testified under oath in an unrelated case that he had paid an investigator to serve as a &quot;runner&quot; for his legal practice to bring in personal injury and criminal clients.&nbsp; Disciplinary counsel alleged that respondent's actions constituted improper client solicitation in violation of </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE7.2'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE7.3'></a>, and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a>(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On June 4, 1996, respondent answered the charges denying the allegations that he commingled and converted funds for his own use, was uncooperative with disciplinary counsel in its investigation, and he paid any person to solicit cases for him.&nbsp; However, on August 8, 1996, respondent tendered a </font>Motion for Consent Discipline<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> admitting the factual allegations of the formal charges.&nbsp; He proposed that he be </font><font size="3">suspended</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> from practice for </font><font size="3">two and one-half (2 1/2) years</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> with </font><font size="3">all but one (1) year and one day being deferred</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">.&nbsp; He further recommended that he be placed on</font><font size="3"> two (2) year probation</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> upon his reinstatement to the practice of law, subject to the following terms:</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">a.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Submission to probation monitoring which shall include periodic review of his client trust account and law office operating account;</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">b.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Performance of five (5) additional hours of Continuing Legal Education credit in&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ethics for each of the two years that he is on probation;</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">c.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No additional violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct during the period of&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;probation; and</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">d.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Payment in full of the costs associated with these disciplinary proceedings.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">On August 27, 1996, disciplinary counsel concurred in the proposed discipline.&nbsp; Subsequently, the hearing committee and disciplinary board filed its recommendations approving the consent discipline.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Upon </font><font face='Times New Roman'>review of the record of the disciplinary board's findings and recommendations,</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> and the record filed herein, it is the decision of the court that the motion for discipline by consent be granted.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Accordingly, it is ordered that respondent be </font>suspended<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> from the practice of law for </font>two and one-half (2 1/2) years <font face='Times New Roman' size="3">with </font>all but one (1) year and one (1) day<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> being </font>deferred. <font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> It is further ordered that respondent be placed on </font>probation<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> for </font>two (2) years<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> upon his </font>reinstatement <font face='Times New Roman' size="3">to the practice of law, subject to the </font>conditions<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> set forth in the motion for discipline by consent.&nbsp; All costs of these proceedings are assessed against respondent.</font></p>
