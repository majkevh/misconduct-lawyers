<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: BERNARD JOSEPH BLAIR, II</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary proceeding arises from one count of formal 
 charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, 
 Bernard Joseph Blair, II, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">For over twenty years, respondent's mother-in-law, Beverly 
 Victorianne, lived next door to Alicemae Casanave, a woman in her eighties. Ms. 
 Victorianne, a retired nurse, became close friends with Ms. Casanave and 
 assisted her in her daily needs.&nbsp; In the summer of 1997, Ms. Casanave's 
 cousin, Mary Ellen Strong, took Ms. Casanave from New Orleans to Atlanta for a 
 period of time. During that time, Ms. Casanave purportedly executed a quitclaim 
 deed, dated August 2, 1997, which provided that Ms. Casanave was transferring 
 her home, valued at approximately $100,000, to Ms. Strong for the sum of $10.
 <a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">When Ms. Casanave returned to New Orleans, her health and 
 mental acuity had declined. She advised Ms. Victorianne and her other friends 
 she had been abducted against her will and feared that Ms. Strong would put her 
 in a nursing facility in order to get her home. Another neighbor contacted Ms. 
 Casanave's next of kin, Marguerite Thompson, Ph.D., a niece who resided in New 
 York, to advise of her aunt's abduction and her marked change in health.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In early August, 1997, Dr. Thompson arrived in New Orleans. 
 She consulted respondent about protecting Ms. Casanave's legal rights. After 
 meeting with Dr. Thompson, Ms. Casanave and Ms. Victorianne, respondent 
 suggested Ms. Casanave execute a power of attorney in favor of Dr. Thompson. 
 Respondent had Ms. Casanave and Dr. Thompson each sign an employment contract 
 providing that he would be paid a retainer, in addition to an hourly fee for 
 rendered legal advice and services.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On August 7, 1997, respondent prepared the power of attorney 
 by which Ms. Casanave gave Dr. Thompson a power of attorney. Approximately one 
 month later, respondent drafted a new power of attorney making Dr. Thompson and 
 Ms. Victorianne co-mandataries over Ms. Casanave's affairs. He also prepared 
 interdiction papers in the event Ms. Casanave became incapacitated. Respondent 
 completed the work on September 15, 1997, and was paid $867.50 directly by Ms. 
 Casanave. Dr. Thompson did not pay respondent any fees. Thereafter, Dr. 
 Thompson returned to New York.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Over the course of the following two to three weeks, 
 respondent had numerous discussions with Ms. Casanave regarding the preparation 
 of a will.<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> In these discussions, Ms. Casanave 
 advised respondent that she only wished to leave a portion of her estate to Dr. 
 Thompson and wanted to leave the bulk of the estate to various religious 
 organizations and certain relatives and friends, including respondent's 
 mother-in-law, Ms. Victorianne, and her two children. Ms. Casanave provided 
 respondent with a one-page document, dated September 30, 1991 (six years 
 earlier), written and signed by her which enumerated her bequests. 
 Specifically, the document provided she wanted to leave her home and its 
 contents to Ms. Victorianne and her children. Respondent prepared the will as 
 instructed, which included, among others, testamentary dispositions to Dr. 
 Thompson, and respondent's mother-in-law, brother-in-law and spouse. The will 
 was executed on October 11, 1997, in the presence of two witnesses.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Almost two years later, in June, 1999, Ms. Casanave passed 
 away. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Thompson learned that Ms. Casanave's will made 
 disposition to persons other than herself and her daughter.<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> 
 At about the same time, Ms. Strong produced the quitclaim deed that purportedly 
 showed she was the actual owner of Ms. Casanave's home.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Thereafter, Dr. Thompson retained attorney George Chaney to 
 challenge the will, on the ground Ms. Casanave lacked testamentary capacity. In 
 connection with this litigation, Dr. Thompson moved to disqualify respondent 
 from representing the succession, primarily on the basis that his testimony 
 would be required to determine the decedent's capacity. Respondent, on behalf 
 of himself and Ms. Victorianne (the executrix of Ms. Casanave's succession), 
 filed a reconventional demand against Dr. Thompson and Mr. Chaney.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Around the same time, respondent's wife, who had retained 
 independent counsel, learned respondent had engaged in a prohibited transaction 
 by drafting a will which provided a testamentary gift to her as his spouse.<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> 
 Accordingly, she renounced her interest in the succession.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">During the course of the litigation, respondent gave a 
 deposition stating he was retained for the purpose of protecting Ms. Casanave 
 from being abducted again by her cousin. Respondent testified he considered Ms. 
 Casanave to be his only client, and that he had never received legal fees from 
 Dr. Thompson. Respondent maintained that the second power of attorney was 
 drafted because Ms. Casanave wanted his mother-in-law included in the revised 
 power of attorney to assist in handling Ms. Casanave's affairs with Dr. 
 Thompson, who intended to return to New York. Additionally, respondent 
 testified Ms. Casanave made it clear she did not wish to leave her entire 
 estate to Dr. Thompson, and that she did not want the terms of her testament 
 disclosed to anyone.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Chaney, Dr. Thompson's counsel in the succession 
 litigation, conducted his own investigation into the testamentary capacity of 
 Ms. Casanave. He spoke to several persons, including Marie Langie, who was a 
 longtime friend of the decedent.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">She advised him that although Ms. Casanave was "fragile" 
 when she returned from Atlanta, her mental state had improved at the time the 
 will was drafted and that she had testamentary capacity. Mr. Chaney also spoke 
 to respondent and, after determining respondent had been unaware of the 
 prohibition on attorneys from making a testamentary gift to an immediate family 
 member in a client's will, he concluded there was no fraud involved on 
 respondent's part. Based on his investigation, Mr. Chaney concluded the will 
 should be given effect as written, in the absence of the disposition to 
 respondent's wife.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Ultimately, other counsel was retained to represent the 
 succession. The parties entered into settlement negotiations, culminating in a 
 consent judgment. Pursuant to this judgment, Ms. Strong received the house in 
 accordance with the quitclaim. Respondent's wife's portion was returned to the 
 estate and the remaining legacies were left intact.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on a complaint from Dr. Thompson, the ODC commenced an 
 investigation into respondent's conduct in this matter. Based on this 
 investigation, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent 
 alleging he violated Rules <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.4 --#">1.4</a> (failure to 
 communicate), <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.7 --#">1.7</a>(b) (engaging in a conflict 
 of interest) and <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.8 --#">1.8</a>(c) (preparing an 
 instrument for a client giving a member of the attorney's immediate family a 
 testamentary gift) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an answer. He admitted he had violated Rule 
 1.8 when he drafted the will providing for a testamentary disposition in favor 
 of his wife, but maintained any violation was unintentional. He denied that he 
 failed to communicate with his client. He further denied the ODC's allegations 
 that he engaged in a conflict of interest by representing Ms. Casanave and Dr. 
 Thompson simultaneously.&nbsp; According to respondent, he did not consider Dr. 
 Thompson to be his client in the matter. Moreover, he claimed he had no duty to 
 inform Dr. Thompson of the contents of Ms. Casanave's will, as Ms. Casanave 
 expressly requested that he keep the existence and the contents of the will 
 confidential.</p>
<h3>Formal Hearing</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">A formal hearing was conducted before the hearing committee. 
 The parties submitted documentary evidence, including the record from the 
 contested succession. In addition, several witnesses testified at the hearing, 
 including Mr. Chaney, Dr. Thompson, Dr. Thompson's daughter and respondent.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Chaney testified he believed respondent was unaware of 
 the Rule 1.8(c) prohibition which bars an attorney drafting a will from making 
 a testamentary gift to himself or an immediate family member. Further, he 
 stated respondent took immediate and concerted efforts to cure the problem.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Dr. Thompson testified respondent and Ms. Victorianne used 
 undue influence over Ms. Casanave to gain control over her home and its 
 contents. According to Dr. Thompson, her aunt would never have bequeathed the 
 house to a non-family member.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent denied that he exercised any influence over Ms. 
 Casanave regarding the testamentary dispositions to be made. He asserted he was 
 unaware of the prohibition of making a testamentary gift to his wife when he 
 drafted the will, and contended the issue never concerned him because he and 
 his wife have a separate property regime. Respondent expressed remorse for his 
 unintentional misconduct.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-046.HC --#">Recommendation of the Hearing Committee</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee determined the ODC proved by clear and 
 convincing evidence that respondent engaged in a conflict of interest in 
 violation of Rules 1.7(b). The committee rejected respondent's position that 
 Ms. Casanave was his only client, noting that the undisputed evidence 
 established Dr. Thompson had signed a retainer agreement, the committee found 
 no merit in respondent's argument that Ms. Casanave was his only client. It 
 also determined respondent improperly represented his mother-in-law as 
 executrix and himself in the will contest litigation instituted by his own 
 client, Dr. Thompson.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The committee also found respondent violated Rule 1.8(c), as 
 he admitted to drafting a will making a prohibited legacy to his wife. The 
 committee concluded respondent's violation was unintentional and negligent, and 
 that he expressed remorse for his actions. However, the committee found 
 respondent's "willful blindness" of the potential conflicts of interest 
 suggests a heightened potential for risk to the public if unchecked.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Despite its finding that respondent represented Dr. 
 Thompson, the committee determined there insufficient evidence to find 
 respondent violated Rule 1.4 by failing to communicate with her. It concluded 
 respondent had no obligation to inform Dr. Thompson that he was drafting a will 
 for Ms. Casanave. In support, it relied on respondent's uncontradicted 
 testimony that Ms. Casanave urged respondent to not disclose the existence and 
 terms of her will.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Citing Standards 2.7 and 4.32 of the ABA's Standards for 
 Imposing Lawyer Sanctions,<a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> the hearing committee 
 determined the baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct was suspension 
 with probation. The committee concluded vulnerability of the victim was the 
 only aggravating factor. It recognized in mitigation respondent's lack of prior 
 disciplinary record, full disclosure and cooperation with the ODC, inexperience 
 in the practice of law (admitted in 1991, approximately six years at the time 
 of the misconduct) and remorse.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on its findings, the hearing committee recommended 
 that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six 
 months, with all but one month deferred. It further proposed respondent be 
 subjected to a practice monitor during his suspension, attend an additional 
 hour of CLE in the area of ethics and professionalism, and attend a course in 
 law practice-management skills.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-046.BD --#">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board concurred in the findings of the 
 hearing committee relative to the violations of Rules 1.7(b) (engaging in a 
 conflict of interest) and 1.8(c) (preparing an instrument for a client giving a 
 member of the attorney's immediate family a testamentary gift). It also agreed 
 with the committee there was insufficient evidence of a violation of Rule 1.4 
 (failure to communicate) noting that, because the ODC's position accepts that 
 both Ms. Casanave and Dr. Thompson were respondent's clients, respondent was 
 obligated to maintain Ms. Casanave's client-confidences as instructed and could 
 not have informed Dr. Thompson of the will's contents. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The board determined respondent negligently violated duties 
 owed to his client, resulting in actual injury in that a lawsuit spanning one 
 year ensued following the filing of the petition to probate Ms. Casanave's 
 will. The board pointed out the suit was largely based upon allegations 
 concerning respondent's breach of his ethical duties to his clients, which also 
 called into question the validity of the portions of the will.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Like the committee, the board agreed the baseline sanction 
 was a suspension, and adopted the aggravating and mitigating factors cited by 
 the committee. However, the board modified the committee's proposed sanction, 
 and recommended that in addition to the six month suspension recommended by the 
 committee, respondent be placed on supervised probation for six months and be 
 required to successfully complete the ethics school program offered through the 
 Louisiana State Bar Association ("LSBA"). One board member dissented to the 
 leniency of the proposed sanction.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed a timely objection to the board's 
 recommendation. As a result, the court docketed the matter for briefing and 
 argument in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 11(G)(1)(b).</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original 
 jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(B). Consequently, we act as 
 triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine 
 whether the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing 
 evidence. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94),
 <a href="#!-- #ID:646%20So.2d%20343 --#">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>. While we 
 are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing 
 committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error standard is 
 applicable to the committee's factual findings. See <span class="CITE"><i>In 
 re: Caulfield</i>, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96),
 <a href="#!-- #ID:683%20So.2d%20714 --#">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record clearly supports the conclusion that respondent 
 violated Rule <span class="Rules">1.8(c)</span> by preparing a will which 
 contained a legacy in favor of his wife. Respondent admitted to violating this 
 rule, although he claims his violation was unintentional. With regard to the 
 conflict of interest charges, the central finding by the committee was its 
 determination that respondent represented Dr. Thompson.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent asserts that it was his intent (and, he believed, 
 the intent of all the parties) that his representation of Dr. Thompson was 
 contingent on Ms. Casanave's interdiction. Because this event never took place, 
 respondent maintains his representation of Dr. Thompson never commenced. 
 However, respondent's position is contradicted by the retainer agreement 
 between Dr. Thompson and respondent, which places no limitations or conditions 
 on the representation. Under these circumstances, the committee's factual 
 finding that respondent represented Dr. Thompson is not clearly wrong.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Having represented Ms. Casanave and Dr. Thompson 
 simultaneously, it is obvious that an irreconcilable conflict existed when Ms. 
 Casanave asked respondent to prepare a will that adversely affected Dr. 
 Thompson's rights. That conflict was exacerbated when respondent represented 
 the executrix of Ms. Casanave's will in connection with Dr. Thompson's suit 
 challenging the validity of the will. These actions plainly violate Rule
 <span class="Rules">1.7(b)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC asks us to find a violation of Rule 1.4 on the 
 ground that respondent failed to communicate with Dr. Thompson regarding his 
 involvement in the preparation of Ms. Casanave's will. This we decline to do. 
 Of course, as stated above, respondent should not have placed himself in this 
 position. However, once he did, we cannot fault respondent for respecting Ms. 
 Casanave's wishes that the existence of and terms of her will not be disclosed 
 to anyone.<a class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Finding respondent engaged in professional misconduct, we 
 now turn to the discussion of an appropriate sanction. The purpose of 
 disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to 
 maintain the appropriate standards of professional conduct, to preserve the 
 integrity of the legal profession and to deter other lawyers from engaging in 
 violations of the standards of the profession. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: 
 Vaughan</i>, 00-1892 (La. 10/27/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:772%20So.2d%2087 --#">
 772 So. 2d 87</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Lain</i>, 00-0148 (La. 
 5/26/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:760%20So.2d%201152 --#">760 So. 2d 1152</a></span>. 
 The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the 
 seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating 
 and mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Redd</i>, 95-1472 
 (La. 9/15/95), <a href="#!-- #ID:660%20So.2d%20839 --#">660 So. 2d 839</a></span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The appropriate sanction for a violation of the conflict of 
 interest provisions of Rule 1.7 has generally been a suspension, all or part of 
 which may be deferred.<a class="fn" href="#fn7">7</a> This court has not 
 previously had the occasion to confront a violation of Rule 1.8(c), but the 
 baseline sanction would appear to fall within the same general range. As an 
 aggravating factor, we recognize vulnerability of the victim. In mitigation, we 
 find respondent lacks a prior disciplinary record, was relatively inexperienced 
 in the practice of law at the time of the offense and has demonstrated sincere 
 remorse for his actions.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering the case as a whole, we conclude respondent's 
 actions were the result of negligence rather than due to any improper motive.8 
 Accordingly, we find a three-month suspension from the practice of law is 
 responsive to the misconduct.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the 
 hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, briefs, 
 and oral argument, it is ordered that Bernard Joseph Blair, II be suspended 
 from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of three months. All costs 
 and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with 
 Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days 
 from the date of the finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
<hr>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> It is unclear from the record 
 whether Ms. Casanave actually executed the deed. There is a suggestion that the 
 deed was forged or that she lacked capacity and/or was under duress when she 
 prepared the quitclaim.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> Respondent testified at the formal 
 hearing that the first three discussions regarding the preparation of the will 
 took place in the presence of Dr. Thompson during her stay in New Orleans. In 
 contrast, Dr. Thompson alleged she was never present for a conversation where 
 her aunt discussed the desire for or terms of a will. Her testimony also 
 contradicts the testimony of her own daughter, Georgene Thompson.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> Dr. Thompson had not seen her aunt 
 since visiting New Orleans at the time the power of attorney was drafted.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> Rule 1.8(c) provides "a lawyer shall 
 not prepare an instrument giving the lawyer or person related to the lawyer as 
 parent, child, sibling, or spouse any substantial gift from a client, including 
 a testamentary gift, except where the client is related to the donee."</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">5</a> Standard 2.7 provides probation is a 
 sanction that allows a lawyer to practice law under specified conditions. The 
 provision notes that probation may be imposed alone or in conjunction with a 
 reprimand or admonition, as well as a condition to readmission or 
 reinstatement.<br>
 Standard 4.32 provides suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer is 
 negligent in determining whether the representation of a client may be 
 materially affected by the lawyer's own interest, or whether the representation 
 will adversely affect another client, and causes injury or potential injury to 
 a client.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn6">6</a> Under the ODC's theory, respondent 
 is placed in a "catch-22&quot; position: if he were to reveal the information 
 regarding the will to Dr. Thompson, he would violate his duty to Ms. Casanave, 
 but if he did not, he would be guilty of failure to communicate with Dr. 
 Thompson.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn7">7</a> See, e.g., <span class="CITE"><i>In 
 re: Faucheux,</i> 02-0054 (La. 5/24/02),
 <a href="#!-- #ID:818%20So.2d%20734 --#">818 So. 2d 734</a></span> (fully 
 deferred six month suspension, subject to a one year period of probation 
 imposed on attorney who, among other things, engaged in a conflict of interest 
 in connection with a domestic proceeding ); <span class="CITE"><i>In re:

 <a href="#!-- #ID:773%20So.2d%20709 --#">773 So. 2d 709</a></span> (fully

 the wife had filed criminal battery charges against her husband and, rather, 
 acquiesced in the request of the husband's attorney, who was also an assistant 
 district attorney, that the case against his client be continued or dismissed).</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn8">8</a> In <span class="CITE"><i>In re: 
 Grevemberg</i>, <a href="2002-2721">02-B-2721</a></span>, rendered this day, we 
 imposed a one-year suspension for a violation of Rule 1.8(c). A greater 
 sanction was justified in that case because we found the attorney knowingly 
 disregarded his ethical obligations under Rule 1.8(c) by continuing litigation 
 at a time when he was clearly aware he was in violation of the rule. By 
 contrast, respondent's violations of the rules in the instant case were more 
 negligent than intentional.</p>
