NO. 98-B-0761.<br>
IN RE: MITCHELLl W. HERZOG<br>
</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'> ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS<br>
PER CURIAM. (FN*)</p>
<p>*************************************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from a complaint filed with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) by Lee Schlesinger, former Chief Executive Officer and majority stockholder of the Westminster Corp.&nbsp; </p>
<p>(&quot;Westminster&quot;), against respondent, Mitchell Herzog, a New Orleans attorney, alleging respondent represented adverse clients, giving rise to an impermissible conflict of interest.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The record indicates that respondent, a former member of the law firm of Shusan, Meyer, and McPherson, had represented Westminster, a commercial real estate corporation, for several years.&nbsp; In 1990, when the corporation was experiencing financial troubles, respondent &quot;strongly suggested&quot; that Westminster merge with Sizeler Corp., another real estate development corporation owned by Sidney Lassen.&nbsp; Unbeknownst to Schlesinger, respondent had represented Lassen and some of his many companies.&nbsp; After the merger, </p>
<p>Schlesinger was removed as CEO of Westminster and lost control of his company.<br>
<span class="PlainText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Schlesinger subsequently filed a legal malpractice suit against respondent, alleging respondent represented the two adverse interests in the multi-million dollar merger deal, resulting in an obvious conflict of interest.&nbsp; After a jury trial, Schlesinger was awarded $5.5 million in damages.&nbsp; This judgment was later affirmed on appeal.&nbsp; </span><span class="CITE">Schlesinger v. Herzog,&nbsp; (La.App. 4th Cir. 4/3/96), 672 So.2d 701.<br>
</span><span class="PlainText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In October of 1997, both respondent and the ODC filed a joint petition for interim suspension in this court.&nbsp; On October 10, 1997, this court placed respondent on interim suspension pending further orders of the court, and ordered necessary&nbsp; disciplinary proceedings be instituted.</span><span class="CITE">&nbsp; In re:&nbsp; Herzog, 97-2324 (La.10/10/97), 703 So.2d 592.<br>
</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prior to the filing of formal charges, respondent tendered a Petition for Consent Discipline.&nbsp; He acknowledged his conduct violated<span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"> Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.7'></a> (conflict of interest) and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE2.2'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a> (acting as an intermediary) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, and proposed he be suspended from the practice of law for a period of eighteen months.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subsequently, the ODC filed a concurrence to the petition and submitted its evidence in support of the complaint filed against respondent.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A702c?an=JD_97-DB-056 --##'>On March 23, 1997, the disciplinary board filed its recommendation with this court</a>, finding &quot;the proffered consent discipline is appropriate and within the guidelines under which the board operates ... [and] will serve to protect the integrity of the profession and caution others to avoid such serious conflicts in the future.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; It further recommended the suspension be made effective from the date of interim suspension, October 10, 1997, and that all costs of the proceedings be assessed to respondent.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the disciplinary board's findings and recommendation, and the record filed herein, it is the decision of the court that the recommendation of the board be adopted.<br>
<font face='Times New Roman'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accordingly, it is ordered that Mitchell W. Herzog be </font>suspended <font face='Times New Roman'>from the practice of law for a period of </font>eighteen months<font face='Times New Roman'>, effective from October 10, 1997, the date of interim suspension.&nbsp; All costs of these proceedings are assessed against respondent.</font><p>
