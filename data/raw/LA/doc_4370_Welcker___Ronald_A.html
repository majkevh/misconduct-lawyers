<p><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the formal charges were filed, respondent filed a petition for consent discipline, proposing that he be disbarred from the practice of law. <span class="CITE">(FN5)</span>&nbsp; The ODC concurs in this sanction.</p>
<p><b>Disciplinary Board Recommendation</b></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The disciplinary board found that respondent violated duties owed to his clients, the public, and the profession, and that respondent's misconduct was knowing, intentional, and caused &quot;a great amount of actual injury.&quot;&nbsp; The board also noted that this matter presents the third instance in which respondent has faced disbarment for commingling and converting client funds.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Considering the circumstances, the board concluded the proposed consent discipline is appropriate.&nbsp; Accordingly, the board recommended respondent be disbarred, that his license to practice law be revoked, and that he be ordered to pay restitution to his victims.&nbsp; The board also recommended that respondent, who is already disbarred, be prohibited from petitioning this court for readmission pursuant to  until five years have elapsed from the effective date of this disbarment.&nbsp; The board further recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of the court's judgment until paid.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the board's recommendation.</p>
<p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that respondent is unfit to practice law in the State of Louisiana.&nbsp; Respondent, twice disbarred by this court for conversion and commingling of client and third party funds, has repeatedly acted with callous disregard for the interests of his clients, the public, and the profession as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accordingly, we will accept the petition for consent discipline. Recognizing that respondent is currently disbarred, we will extend the minimum period for readmission for an additional five years from the date of finality of this judgment.<i>&nbsp; </i><span class="CITE">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Krasnoff, 502 So.2d 1018 (La.1987).</span></p>
<p><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p><font face='Courier'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font> Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is the decision of this court that the recommendation of the disciplinary board be accepted.&nbsp; Accordingly, <font face='Times New Roman'>it is ordered that the minimum period within which Ronald A. Welcker may seek readmission to the practice of law be extended for a period of five years</font>, commencing from the finality of this judgment.&nbsp; Respondent is ordered to make full restitution to his victims.&nbsp; All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with , with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of judgment until paid.</p>
<p class='footnotetitle'>FOOTNOTES:</p>
<p class='footnote'>FN* Calogero, C.J., not on panel.&nbsp; Rule IV, Part II, s 3.</p>
<p class='footnote'>FN1. Respondent was disbarred on June 3, 1997 for misconduct involving commingling and conversion of client funds.<i>&nbsp; In re: Welcker,</i> 97-0825 (La.6/3/97), 694 So.2d 918. On October 3, 1997, respondent's disbarment was extended by five years for similar misconduct.<i>&nbsp; In re: Welcker,</i> 97-2004 (La.10/3/97), 701 So.2d 186.</p>
<p class='footnote'>FN2. As a result of respondent's failure to appear in court on behalf of the Brunettis, warrants were issued for their arrest and additional fines were imposed by the court.</p>
<p class='footnote'>FN3. When Mr. Cochenic learned of respondent's disbarment, he contacted the insurance company that had issued the settlement draft.&nbsp; The insurer was able to place a stop payment on the draft in sufficient time to prevent the actual conversion of funds by respondent.</p>
<p class='footnote'>FN4. At the time Ms. Debernardin filed her complaint with the ODC, the expiration of the five-year abandonment period was only weeks away.&nbsp; The ODC advised Ms. Debernardin to seek new counsel to enroll and take action on an emergency basis, and dismissal of the suit was averted.</p>
<p class='footnote'>FN5. Respondent acknowledged that he engaged in the misconduct set forth in the formal charges, with the exception of the allegation that he engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.&nbsp; Respondent also acknowledged his criminal conviction as charged in the supplemental and amending formal charge in 98-DB-019.</p>
