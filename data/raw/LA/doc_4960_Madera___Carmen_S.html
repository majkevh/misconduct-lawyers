  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-0816</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: CARMEN S. MADERA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, Carmen S. Madera, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.<a name="fnref1"
  class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed two sets of formal charges against respondent. The first set, bearing the
  disciplinary board's docket number 02-DB-022, was filed on February 25, 2002 and consists of two counts of
  misconduct. The second set, bearing the disciplinary board's docket number 03-DB-048, was filed on July 31, 2003 and
  consists of six counts of misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The first set of formal charges was considered by a hearing committee and the disciplinary board.
  After the board's recommendation was lodged in this court, the ODC filed a motion to remand the matter to the board
  for consolidation with the second set of formal charges. This court granted the motion. In re: Madera, 03-2947 (La.
  4/7/04). On March 29, 2005, the board filed in this court a single recommendation of discipline encompassing both
  sets of formal charges.</p>

  <h3>02-DB-022</h3>

  <h4>Counts I &amp; II</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was retained to represent Bernard Bagalso and Christopher Cagandahan in a personal
  injury matter. Respondent settled her clients' cases on December 6, 1999. Because she did not have a client trust
  account at this time, respondent deposited the settlement checks into her operating account. Respondent then paid her
  clients with checks drawn on an account belonging to a friend, Edna Anderson.<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2"
  id="fnref2">2</a> Respondent withheld a total of $3,711.80 from the settlement proceeds to pay medical expenses owed
  by Mr. Bagalso and Mr. Cagandahan to Uptown Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. However, respondent failed to
  disburse the funds to the medical provider.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Bagalso filed a disciplinary complaint against respondent, alleging that she settled his case
  without his knowledge or consent. The medical provider also filed a disciplinary complaint against respondent. The
  ODC forwarded a copy of the complaints to respondent by certified mail. However, respondent failed to reply to the
  medical provider's complaint. The ODC thereafter served respondent with two subpoenas compelling her to appear and
  answer the complaint under oath. On both occasions, respondent failed to appear. On June 13, 2001, during a sworn
  statement in connection with an unrelated disciplinary matter, respondent agreed to appear on June 18, 2001 to answer
  the complaint. Again, she failed to appear. The ODC then served respondent with a third subpoena compelling her to
  appear on October 3, 2001. Respondent sent a letter to the ODC on September 30, 2001, requesting that the sworn
  statement be rescheduled for October 31, 2001. Respondent finally appeared on that date.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.1(a)</span> (failure to provide competent representation to a client), <span class=
  "allegedrules">1.2(a)</span> (scope of the representation), <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act
  with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to
  communicate with a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.5</span> (fee arrangements), <span class=

  <span class="allegedrules">1.15(a)</span>(b)(d) (safekeeping property of clients or third persons), <span class=
  "allegedrules">8.1(b)</span> (knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary
  authority), <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct), <span class=
  "allegedrules">8.4(b)</span> (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on the lawyer's honesty,
  trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving
  dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct
  prejudicial to the administration of justice), and 8.4(g) (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation).</p>

  <h3>03-DB-048</h3>

  <h4>Count I</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In August 1999, respondent enrolled as counsel of record in a succession matter pending in the 34
  Judicial D th istrict Court. Respondent filed several pleadings in the matter during a period of time in which she
  was ineligible to practice law for failure to pay her bar dues and the disciplinary assessment, and for failure to
  comply with the mandatory continuing legal education ("MCLE") requirements. On March 1, 2002, respondent appeared in
  open court to argue a motion, at which time the presiding judge learned that she was ineligible to practice.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules
  1.1(b) (failure to comply with the minimum requirements of continuing legal education), 3.3 (lack of candor toward
  the tribunal), 3.5(c) (engaging in conduct intended to disrupt a tribunal), 5.5(a) (engaging in the unauthorized
  practice of law), 8.4(a), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d).</p>

  <h4>Counts II, III, &amp; IV</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was retained to represent Rhodri Lazaro, Geraldine Emnace, and Princess Emnace in a
  personal injury matter. Respondent's clients received medical treatment from Stagni Chiropractic Clinic, which sent a
  lien letter to respondent. In April 2001, respondent settled her clients' cases. The settlements included funds
  totaling $4,261 to pay the medical provider's bills. However, respondent failed to disburse the funds to the medical
  provider.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Furthermore, while respondent was representing these clients, she was ineligible to practice law
  for failure to pay her bar dues and the disciplinary assessment, and for failure to comply with the MCLE
  requirements. Respondent was also on probation during this time pursuant to this court's order in Madera I and
  violated the conditions of her probation by engaging in the above conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The medical provider's attorney filed a disciplinary complaint against respondent. The ODC
  forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail; however, respondent failed to reply. Thereafter,
  the ODC served respondent with a subpoena compelling her to appear and answer the complaint under oath. Respondent
  failed to appear.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules
  1.15(a)(b), 5.5(a), 8.4(a), 8.4(b), 8.4(c), 8.4(d), and 8.4(g).</p>

  <h4>Counts V &amp; VI</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent failed to fully comply with the conditions of her probation in Madera I. In
  particular, she failed to remain current in her professional obligations; she failed to complete the Louisiana State
  Bar Association's Ethics School; she failed to provide proof that she received treatment for the personal and
  emotional problems that interfere with her ability to practice law; she failed to submit a probation plan or
  regularly meet with her probation monitor; and as of July 14, 2003, she had not paid the costs and expenses
  associated with Madera I.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC served respondent with a subpoena to give a sworn statement regarding this matter.
  However, respondent failed to appear.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules
  8.4(a), 8.4(d), and 8.4(g).</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>02-DB-022</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent answered the formal charges and generally denied any misconduct in connection with her
  representation of Mr. Bagalso and Mr. Cagandahan. She also denied that she deliberately failed to cooperate with the
  ODC in its investigation. The matter then proceeded to a formal hearing on the merits, which was conducted by the
  hearing committee on August 20, 2002. Respondent was the only witness to testify at the hearing.</p>

  <h4><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2002-12-04_02-DB-022.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the evidence presented at the hearing, the hearing committee found that
  respondent has been ineligible to practice law since August 14, 2000 for failing to comply with the MCLE requirements
  and since September 4, 2002 for nonpayment of bar dues and the disciplinary assessment. The committee also found that
  in August 1999, respondent agreed to represent Bernard Bagalso and Christopher Cagandahan in a personal injury case.
  On August 13, 1999, respondent guaranteed payment in writing to Uptown Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation for all
  medical services rendered to her two clients. The cases settled in December 1999 for $4,800. However, respondent did
  not have a client trust account. Therefore, she deposited both settlement checks into her business account. Because
  respondent was unable to withdraw funds from this account immediately, Edna Anderson, a former client who owed
  respondent money, wrote two personal checks in the amount of $1,000 each to Mr. Bagalso and Mr. Cagandahan.
  Subsequently, respondent paid Mr. Bagalso and Mr. Cagandahan $400 each from her account as their remaining portion of
  the settlement proceeds. She left the remaining funds in her account, and later converted these unearned funds to her
  own use. Respondent failed to pay the outstanding balance of $3,711.80 owed to Uptown Physical Medicine and
  Rehabilitation for her clients, and as of the date of the hearing, she had made no attempt to pay restitution to the
  medical provider. Furthermore, the committee found that respondent failed to answer the medical provider's complaint
  because she "couldn't cope with answering" and blamed the medical provider for her own medical problems. She reported
  the same reason for failing to appear for scheduled sworn statements. Despite being personally served or agreeing
  under oath to appear, respondent failed to appear for three scheduled sworn statements. Respondent finally appeared
  and gave a sworn statement on October 31, 2001 after requesting by letter that a fourth scheduled sworn statement be
  reset.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these factual findings, the committee determined that respondent violated Rules 1.5 and
  1.15 of the Rules of Professional Conduct with respect to her failure to maintain a client trust account, her
  commingling and conversion of client and third-party funds, and her failure to make payments to the third-party
  medical provider. The committee also determined that respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation, in violation of Rules 8.1(b), 8.1(c), 8.4(a), and 8.4(g). The committee made no findings as to the
  remaining rule violations alleged in the formal charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee determined that respondent knowingly and intentionally violated duties owed to her
  clients, third parties, the public, and the profession. Her misconduct caused actual harm to her clients and a
  third-party medical provider. Considering the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the committee concluded
  that the baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is disbarment. The committee found that respondent did not
  bear her burden of proving that any mitigating circumstances exist. The committee recognized the following
  aggravating factors: prior disciplinary offenses (the fully deferred suspension imposed in Madera I), dishonest or
  selfish motive, a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by
  intentionally failing to comply with the rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, refusal to acknowledge the
  wrongful nature of the conduct, vulnerability of the victims,<a name="fnref3" id="fnref3">3</a> substantial
  experience in the practice of law (admitted 1990), and indifference to making restitution.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, the committee recommended that respondent be disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h4><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2003-11-18_02-DB-022.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board found the hearing committee's findings of fact are not manifestly
  erroneous, except with respect to its finding that the personal injury claims of Mr. Bagalso and Mr. Cagandahan were
  settled for a total of $4,800. Rather, according to the record, Mr. Bagalso and Mr. Cagandahan each received
  $4,833.90 in settlement, for a total of $9,667.80.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the factual findings, the board determined respondent violated Rules <span class=
  "Rules">1.1(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.15(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.15(b)</span>, <span class=
  "Rules">8.1(b)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span>, <span class=
  "Rules">8.4(b)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct. Respondent acted incompetently by failing to properly handle her clients' settlement proceeds.
  She failed to hold funds belonging to clients and third parties in a separate trust account. Furthermore, she failed
  to promptly notify the medical provider that she had received settlement funds and failed to promptly deliver these
  funds to the medical provider. By converting the funds due the medical provider, respondent committed a criminal act
  that reflects adversely on her honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer. Furthermore, she engaged in
  dishonest, deceitful, and fraudulent conduct when she represented to the medical provider and to her clients that she
  would pay the clients' medical expenses from their settlement, then failed to do so. Finally, respondent failed to
  cooperate with the ODC in its investigation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board determined that the ODC failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence violations of
  Rules <span class="Rules">1.2(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4</span>, <span class=
  "Rules">1.5</span>, <span class="Rules">1.6(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.15(d)</span>, and 8.4(d) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct. The ODC offered no evidence to rebut respondent's testimony that she consulted with her clients
  prior to accepting the settlement offer. Furthermore, there is no evidence that respondent did not diligently pursue
  her clients' matters or that she revealed confidential information to Ms. Anderson.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board concluded that respondent knowingly and intentionally violated duties owed to her
  clients, to the public, and to the profession, causing actual harm to her clients and a third-party medical provider.
  Based on the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions and this court's prior jurisprudence, the board determined
  that the applicable baseline sanction ranges from a lengthy suspension to disbarment. Because respondent had not
  engaged in numerous instances of misconduct, the board felt a suspension, rather than disbarment, is appropriate.
  Accordingly, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for three years. The board
  further recommended that respondent be ordered to make restitution to Uptown Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation,
  and that she be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings. One board member dissented and indicated
  that he would impose disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h3>03-DB-048</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The formal charges were served upon respondent by certified mail delivered on August 2,
  2003.<a name="fnref4" id="fnref4">4</a> Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges.
  Accordingly, the factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing
  evidence pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). No formal hearing was held, but the parties were given an
  opportunity to file with the hearing committee written arguments and documentary evidence on the issue of sanctions.
  Respondent filed nothing for the committee's consideration.</p>

  <h4><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-03-30_03-DB-048.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the ODC's submission, the hearing committee determined that respondent violated
  the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges. The committee found that despite her prior
  discipline, respondent has continued to fail to cooperate with the ODC, engaged in a pattern of converting client
  funds to her own use, and engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these findings, the committee recommended respondent be permanently disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3>02-DB-022 &amp; 03-DB-048</h3>

  <h4><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2005-03-15_02-DB-022.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the consolidated matters, the disciplinary board reiterated its previous findings
  as to 02-DB-022. With regard to 03-DB-048, the board agreed that respondent violated the Rules of Professional
  Conduct as alleged in the formal charges, except that her conversion of funds due to a third-party medical provider
  does not violate Rule 8.4(d). The board found that respondent acted incompetently when she failed to comply with the
  MCLE requirements and handled a succession matter while ineligible. By practicing law while ineligible, respondent
  tainted the court proceedings, engaged in conduct intended to disrupt the tribunal, engaged in the unauthorized
  practice of law, and engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. Furthermore, respondent was
  dishonest and deceitful when she represented to her clients and the court that she was eligible to practice law.
  Respondent also failed to notify Stagni Chiropractic of her receipt of settlement funds and converted those funds to
  her own use. By doing so, she engaged in criminal conduct that was also dishonest, fraudulent, and deceitful.
  Respondent further engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in regard to Count III. She also failed to comply with
  the conditions of her probation, which was prejudicial to the administration of justice. Furthermore, respondent
  failed to cooperate with the ODC in two investigations.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the consolidated matters, the board determined that respondent knowingly and intentionally
  violated duties owed to her clients, the profession, the legal system, and the public. Her conduct caused harm to her
  clients because Stagni Chiropractic filed suit against them when respondent failed to pay their medical bills. She
  also harmed the parties in the succession matter by tainting the proceeding with her improper involvement.
  Furthermore, respondent harmed the disciplinary system by failing to cooperate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board recognized the following aggravating factors: <span class="ABAstandard">prior
  disciplinary offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>, <span class=
  "ABAstandard">a pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>, <span class=
  "ABAstandard">bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the rules
  or orders of the disciplinary agency</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of
  the conduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>, and <span class=
  "ABAstandard">indifference to making restitution</span>. The board found no mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board acknowledged that it had previously recommended a three-year suspension for the
  misconduct in the first set of formal charges. Nevertheless, when coupled with the misconduct in 03-DB-048, the board
  determined that permanent disbarment is warranted, citing Supreme Court Rule XIX, Appendix E, Guideline 1 (repeated
  or multiple instances of intentional conversion of client funds with substantial harm) and Guideline 8 (following
  notice, engaging in the unauthorized practice of law during a period of suspension or disbarment). Based on this
  reasoning, the board recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred. It further recommended that respondent be
  ordered to make restitution to the third-party medical providers and be assessed with all costs and expenses of these
  proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.
  However, on our own motion, we ordered the parties to submit briefs addressing the issue of an appropriate
  sanction.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316
  (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>, 348; <span class="cite">Louisiana State
  Bar Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a>, 445 (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not
  bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held
  the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings. See <span class="cite">In re:
  Caulfield, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class=
  "cite">In re: Pardue, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">It is clear from the record that respondent has violated numerous Rules of Professional Conduct.
  She has converted funds owed to her clients' medical providers. She has practiced law while ineligible to do so for
  failing to pay her bar dues and the disciplinary assessment and for failing to comply with the MCLE requirements. She
  has failed to comply with the conditions of her probation in Madera I and failed to cooperate with the ODC. All of
  this misconduct was knowing or intentional. Respondent violated duties to her clients, the public, the legal system,
  and the profession, causing actual harm to each of these entities.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional misconduct, we now turn to a discussion of an appropriate sanction. In
  considering that issue, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of
  conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class=
  "cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.
  The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved,
  considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v.
  Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is undoubtedly disbarment according to both the
  ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions and <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Hinrichs, <a href=
  "1985-09-10_1989-1459.htm">486 So. 2d 116</a> (La. 1986)</span>.<a name="fnref5" id="fnref5">5</a> In light of the
  aggravating factors present, and the absence of mitigating factors, there is no reason to deviate downward from the
  baseline sanction of disbarment. Disbarment is further supported in this case by respondent's long history of failing
  to fulfill her professional obligations (she has been ineligible since August 14, 2000 for failing to comply with the
  MCLE requirements and since September 4, 2002 for failing to pay bar dues and the disciplinary assessment). See
  <span class="cite">In re: Pitre, 05-0853 (La. 6/17/05), <a href="2005-06-17_2005-0853.htm">903 So. 2d
  1130</a></span>; <span class="cite">In re: Domm, 04-1194 (La. 10/8/04), <a href="2004-10-08_2004-1194.htm">883 So. 2d
  966</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The sole remaining issue presented for our consideration is whether respondent's misconduct is so
  egregious that she should be permanently prohibited from reapplying for admission to the practice of law. In Appendix
  E to Supreme Court Rule XIX, we set forth guidelines illustrating the types of conduct which might warrant permanent
  disbarment. While these guidelines are not intended to bind this court in its decision-making process, they present
  useful information concerning the types of conduct we might consider worthy of permanent disbarment. Applying the
  guidelines to the instant case, we find respondent's conversion of funds due to her clients' medical providers falls
  within the scope of <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 1</span> (repeated or multiple instances of intentional
  conversion of client funds with substantial harm).<a name="fnref6" class="fn" href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a>
  Accordingly, we will accept the recommendation of the disciplinary board and permanently disbar respondent.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committees and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record and the brief filed by the ODC, it is ordered that the name of Carmen S. Madera, Louisiana
  Bar Roll number 19958, be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that her license to practice law in the State of
  Louisiana be revoked. Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered that respondent be
  permanently prohibited from being readmitted to the practice of law in this state. It is further ordered that
  respondent make restitution to her victims. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in
  accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality
  of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> In 1999, this court accepted a
  petition for consent discipline and suspended respondent from the practice of law for one year and one day, fully

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">2</a> Ms. Anderson wrote checks in the
  amount of $1,000 each to Mr. Bagalso and Mr. Cagandahan. After the checks respondent had deposited into her operating
  account cleared, she wrote checks in the amount of $400 each to her clients. In total, Mr. Bagalso and Mr. Cagandahan
  received $1,400 each as their respective shares of the settlements.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3" id="fn3">3</a> The committee observed that
  respondent's clients were not from this country, spoke little English, and had no basic understanding of our legal
  system.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5" class="fn" href="#fnref5" id="fn5">5</a> Hinrichs has established that
  disbarment is appropriate in conversion cases when one or more of the following elements are present:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">the lawyer acts in bad faith and intends a result inconsistent with his client's interest;
    the lawyer commits forgery or other fraudulent acts in connection with the violation; the magnitude or the duration
    of the deprivation is extensive; the magnitude of the damage or risk of damage, expense and inconvenience caused
    the client is great; the lawyer either fails to make full restitution or does so tardily after extended pressure of
    disciplinary or legal proceedings.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn6" class="fn" href="#fnref6" id="fn6">6</a> The disciplinary board also relied on
  Guideline 8 in recommending permanent disbarment in this case. That guideline on its face applies to lawyers who
  engage in the unauthorized practice of law following resignation, suspension, or disbarment. In re: Pitre, supra.
  Because respondent has not resigned from the Louisiana State Bar Association, nor has she served a suspension or been
  disbarred, it follows that Guideline 8 is inapplicable here.</p>
