  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-1701</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: ARCENIOUS FRANCIS ARMOND, JR.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that
  respondent neglected his clients' legal matters, failed to communicate with his clients, and failed to refund
  unearned fees. After the filing of formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent
  discipline, in which they stipulate that respondent's conduct violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (failure
  to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), <span class="Rules">1.4</span> (failure to
  communicate with a client), <span class="Rules">1.5(f)(6)</span> (failure to refund an unearned fee), <span class=
  "Rules">1.16</span> (declining or terminating representation), and <span class="Rules">5.3</span> (responsibilities
  regarding nonlawyer assistants) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Having reviewed the petition for consent
  discipline,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that Arcenious Francis Armond, Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 20678, be and he
  hereby is suspended from the practice of law for one year and one day. It is further ordered that the suspension
  shall be deferred, subject to respondent's successful completion of a two-year period of supervised probation
  governed by the conditions set forth in the petition for consent discipline. Any violation of the conditions of
  probation, or any other misconduct during the probationary period, may be grounds for making the deferred suspension
  executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
