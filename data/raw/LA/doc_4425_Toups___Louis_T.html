<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Respondent has been an Assistant
District Attorney in Lafourche Parish since 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>He is also permitted to maintain a private civil practice while
holding his public position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In March
1997, Ellen Ordoyne retained respondent to represent her in connection with a
divorce and community property matter and a motion for a protective order
against her husband, Todd.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn2' href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[ii]<![endif]></span></span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mr. Ordoyne was represented in these

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Sometime in late March, Mrs.
Ordoyne complained to respondent that her husband had hit her during their
marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Respondent advised his client
that she could file a criminal complaint on these grounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On April 1, 1997, Mrs. Ordoyne appeared
before a Lafourche Parish Justice of the Peace and signed an affidavit
attesting that her husband had battered her on a number of occasions between
December 1996 and March 1997.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is
unclear whether respondent knew that Mrs. Ordoyne had taken this action.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn4' href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[iv]<![endif]></span></span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nevertheless, a simple battery charge
against Mr. Ordoyne was ultimately referred to the District Attorney’s office
in the judicial district where respondent and Mr. Caillouet are Assistant
District Attorneys.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>On April 3, 1997, respondent and
Mr. Caillouet met with Mr. and Mrs. Ordoyne to discuss the domestic
matters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The subject of Mrs. Ordoyne’s
criminal complaint against her husband was not raised at this time.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn5' href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[v]<![endif]></span></span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By all accounts, however, the parties left
the meeting with the impression that all of the issues discussed that day
between Mr. and Mrs. Ordoyne had been resolved.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Mr. Ordoyne was never arrested in
connection with the criminal charge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Instead, a notice of arraignment was served at his mother’s home in
early May 1997.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mr. Ordoyne’s mother
telephoned Mr. Caillouet and asked him whether her son would have to miss work
to appear in court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mr. Caillouet told
her that he would try to determine who had filed the complaint, but advised
that Mr. Ordoyne would have to find other representation for the criminal matter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>On May 7, 1997, Mr. Caillouet
examined the record in the criminal case and learned, apparently for the first
time, that Mrs. Ordoyne had filed a criminal complaint against her
husband.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mr. Caillouet determined that
the conduct forming the basis of the criminal complaint was essentially the
same as the conduct forming the basis of Mrs. Ordoyne’s motion for a protective
order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Believing that all issues
between Mr. and Mrs. Ordoyne had been resolved during the April 3rd meeting, <i>including
Mrs. Ordoyne’s allegations of physical abuse during the marriage</i>, Mr.
Caillouet suggested to respondent that the criminal case against Todd Ordoyne
be continued without date.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mr.
Caillouet claims that he made this suggestion in order that Mr. Ordoyne would
not have to miss a day of work for arraignment on charges which Mr. Caillouet
understood would be mooted by the parties’ settlement agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At no time, however, did Mr. Caillouet
suggest, discuss, or recommend to respondent that the criminal case against Mr.
Ordoyne be dismissed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>There is conflicting testimony in
the record concerning respondent’s reaction to Mr. Caillouet’s proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>According to Mr. Caillouet, respondent
confirmed that all issues between Mr. and Mrs. Ordoyne had been settled, and
respondent agreed that the criminal case be continued without date.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, respondent claims that he told Mr.
Caillouet that this was the first he had heard of the criminal charge, and
stated that he had not spoken with Mrs. Ordoyne and did not know what she would
want to do about the matter, i.e., whether she would agree to drop her criminal
complaint because all other issues involving her husband had been
resolved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nevertheless, despite
respondent’s asserted disagreement with the course of action Mr. Caillouet had
proposed, respondent did not bring the matter to the attention of his client,
the court, or his superiors in the District Attorney’s office.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For his part, Mr. Caillouet asked one of the
clerical workers in the District Attorney’s office to make an entry in the
computer concerning Mr. Ordoyne’s arraignment: “CWOD [continued without date]
pending civil matter per SEC [Mr. Caillouet]. He says Thad [respondent] has
agreed to this.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Mr. Ordoyne was scheduled to be
arraigned the following day, May 8, 1997, in the 17th JDC, Division “A.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This was the division of court normally
handled by Mr. Caillouet; however, he could not be present on that day because
he was recovering from a heart attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>As a result, respondent was asked to handle the criminal docket in
Division “A” that day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Respondent saw a
notation on the docket sheet that the Ordoyne case was to be “CWOD — pending
civil matter per SEC.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Respondent
claims he told his assistant that he could not handle anything related to the
Ordoyne matter, and that he passed over the case without calling it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, the court’s minutes reflect that
“on motion of the State, the court ordered that this matter be continued
without date.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Several days later, when Mrs.
Ordoyne telephoned the District Attorney’s office to inquire about the status
of her husband’s criminal case, she was told that respondent and Mr. Caillouet
had agreed to continue the case without date.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Mrs. Ordoyne was angered by this news and demanded an explanation from
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Respondent thereafter
instructed the District Attorney’s office to change the “CWOD pending civil
matter per SEC” notation in the computer to include “Thad advised his client
will not agree to this.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Not satisfied
with respondent’s answer, Mrs. Ordoyne confronted the Lafourche Parish District
Attorney, Walter “Butch” Naquin, Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Mr. Naquin subsequently ordered both respondent and Mr. Caillouet to
withdraw from the Ordoyne civil matter.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn6' href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[vi]<![endif]></span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>In an unrelated matter, Alva Harris
retained respondent to represent him in a divorce proceeding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>During the pendency of the divorce, Mr.
Harris’ wife, Elizabeth, filed simple battery charges against him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those charges were ultimately lodged in
Thibodaux City Court, where respondent was one of the assigned city
prosecutors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On June 4, 1991, two weeks
before the case against Mr. Harris was scheduled to be tried, respondent wrote
to Mrs. Harris’ attorney, F. Smith “Smitty” Knobloch,<a style='mso-endnote-id:

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.7in;margin-bottom:0in;

Carolina and there is no chance that there will be any further physical
disagreement between the parties, <i>I decided to ask that the charges against
Mr. Harris be continued without date.</i> I have advised him that he is to stay
clear of Mrs. Harris. As per our telephone conversation of several weeks ago,
it is not reasonable to expect him to come back from North Carolina on these
charges and <i>situations like this are commonly handled in such a manner</i>.

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>On the day of trial, the matter was
in fact continued without date by Camille Morvant, the Assistant District
Attorney assigned to the case; however, respondent denied that he directed Mr.
Morvant to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The charges against
Mr. Harris were <i>nolle prosequied</i> by Mr. Morvant one year later.</p>

(a lawyer’s duties to an organizational client); his failure to advise the

newspaper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On December 7, 1998, the ODC
amended the formal charges against respondent to add a second count pertaining
to the Harris matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In Count II, the
ODC alleged that respondent’s conduct violated Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=RULE1.7'></a>
(conflict of interest), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=RULE8.4'></a>(c) (engaging in conduct

they found the testimony of the complainant, Mrs. Ordoyne, conflicting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The committee noted it was difficult to
ascertain a reasonable motive for respondent’s conspiring with Mr. Caillouet to
effectuate, or even to merely acquiesce in, a continuance in the criminal case
against Mr. Ordoyne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They further found
no evidence that respondent believed Mr. Caillouet was doing anything unethical
in continuing Mr. Ordoyne’s case, and thus determined that respondent cannot be
faulted for failing to report what is now alleged to be improper conduct by Mr.
Caillouet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Under these facts, the
committee also concluded that respondent had no ethical duty to affirmatively
advise his client, Mrs. Ordoyne, of the status of Mr. Ordoyne’s criminal
charges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Accordingly, the committee
recommended that the charges in Count I be dismissed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Concerning Count II, the committee
found there was no evidence presented to support the ODC’s theory that
respondent intervened in the criminal prosecution of Mr. Harris while at the

respondent’s letter to Mrs. Harris’ attorney is accepted, it is inconceivable
that opposing counsel would have remained silent in the face of such unethical
and illegal conduct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Moreover, the
Assistant District Attorney assigned to the case would also have had to have
been a “conspirator” in respondent’s plan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The ODC argues that respondent
ignored the conflict of interest in the Ordoyne and Harris matters, violating
his sworn constitutional duties as an Assistant District Attorney and his
obligations under the Rules of Professional Conduct. The ODC argues that once
Mrs. Ordoyne filed a criminal complaint against her husband, respondent should
have immediately notified his respective clients — public and private — of the
conflict of interest and withdrawn from the representation, as is required by
the Rules of Professional Conduct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When

conflict prior to accepting representation of a civil client. When such a
conflict or potential conflict presents itself, the prosecutor must, depending
on the circumstances, either refrain from accepting representation or withdraw
as counsel. In the event the conflict arises during the course of
representation, the prosecuting attorney has an affirmative obligation to seek
