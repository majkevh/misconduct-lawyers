  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a Petition for Consent Discipline by
  James E. Norwood, (herein "Respondent") of West Monroe, Louisiana.</p>

  <h2><b>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  On May 10, 2000, Respondent filed a Petition for Consent Discipline in this matter.  Respondent
  admits to having failed to communicate critical information regarding his representation to his client in violation
  of Rule of Professional Conduct <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span>.<a class="fn" name="_ednref1" href="#_edn1"
  id="_ednref1">[i]</a>  Respondent submits that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction in this matter.  The
  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (herein "ODC") filed a concurrence with the consent discipline on the same date. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On June 29, 2000, a panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter. The Respondent appeared
  in proper person. Deputy Counsel Robert S. Kennedy, Jr. represented the ODC.</p>

  <h2><b>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  Respondent's client, Darla (Shumway) Cash, was sued by Bank One in connection with a default on
  an outstanding loan made by her and her then-husband in 1994.  As security for the loan, Mr. Shumway had pledged a
  fishing boat and trailer as collateral.  Thereafter, Ms. Cash and her husband divorced.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After her ex-husband defaulted on the loan, the bank sought the collateral, but discovered that
  Mr. Shumway had disposed of it.  Bank One then made demand on Ms. Cash for the balance of the loan.  She paid the
  note for a period of time, but later became ill and unable to make the payments.  She subsequently defaulted on the
  loan, and the Bank filed suit against her alone for the balance due ($2791.97) in June of 1998.  Ms. Cash filed an
  answer to the suit in proper person and later sought the services of Respondent in the defense of the suit.  Before
  Ms. Cash retained Respondent, Bank One filed a motion for summary judgment against her.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> Respondent charged Ms. Cash a fee of $1500.00, which she ultimately paid.  Respondent later
  filed a third party demand on Ms. Cash's behalf against Mr. Shumway.  Respondent also prepared and filed an amended
  answer alleging various technical deficiencies in the bank's documentary submissions in support of the motion for
  summary judgment.  There were no substantive factual or legal defenses available to the client that would operate to
  defeat the bank's claim.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Initially, in September of 1998, the Court denied Bank One's motion for summary judgment but
  granted Bank One leave to amend the motion to correct the deficiencies in the documentary submission.  The Bank
  corrected the deficiencies and refixed the matter for hearing on December 14, 1998.  Respondent was notified by the
  clerk of court of this fixing, but failed to record it on his office calendar or notify his client of the hearing
  date.  On December 14, 1998, Respondent failed to appear.  Judgment was granted against Ms. Cash and in favor of Bank
  One in the amount of $2791.97 together with accrued interest.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent received notice of judgment on December 17, 1998, but neglected to provide his client
  with a copy of the judgment promptly or notify her that it had been granted.  On March 21, 1999, when Ms. Cash came
  in for a consultation on an unrelated succession matter, Respondent advised her that the judgment had been rendered
  against her.  In the interim, the judgment had become final.  Significantly, the ODC states in its memorandum in
  support of the consent discipline that the evidence suggests that Ms. Cash's chances of avoiding a judgment were
  virtually non-existent.  Ms. Cash's single hope of avoiding sole responsibility lay in the pending third-party demand
  against her ex-husband.  Respondent states that Ms. Cash advised him to abandon efforts to collect the judgment
  against her ex-husband due to his financial insolvency.  However, the lawsuit against Mr. Shumway is still pending
  before the court in Ouachita Parish.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The client complained to Respondent and demanded a refund prior to the disciplinary complaint
  being filed. Respondent refunded $991.00 of the original fee in the form of a credit to a succession matter that the
  client asked Respondent to handle.  This amount represented the unearned portion of the fee.  The client agreed to
  this arrangement by executing a letter of agreement.</p>

  <h2><b>PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE AND CONCURRENCE BY ODC</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  As noted above, Respondent proposes a public reprimand as the appropriate sanction here.  The
  ODC concurs in this proposed discipline.  The ODC cites as mitigating factors the <span class="ABAstandard">absence
  of a prior disciplinary record</span> as well as frank <span class="ABAstandard">acknowledgment of
  misconduct</span>.  No aggravating factors are cited.</p>

  <h2> <b>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</b> </h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors: </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>1. whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the
    profession;</p>

    <p>2.  whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p>3.  the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p>4.  the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board finds that the Respondent, by failing to communicate the information concerning the
  judgment to his client, violated his duty owed to her.  The Respondent's actions in this matter were negligent. 
  Further, the Board finds that Ms. Cash was potentially, if not actually, injured by the Respondent's misconduct-she
  did not learn of the judgment until three months after it was rendered against her.  Finally, the Board finds the
  mitigating factors of absence of a prior disciplinary record and Respondent's acknowledgment of misconduct are
  supported by the record. The lack of aggravating factors is also supported by the record.</p>

  <h2><b>ANALYSIS</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A.B.A. <i>Standards </i> for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span> provides that "reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent
  and does not act with reasonable diligence in representing a client, and causes injury or potential injury to a
  client."  Cases cited by the ODC, which provide guidance here, include <span class="cite"><i>LSBA v. St. Romain</i>,
  <a href="../SC/1990-04-30_1989-0252.htm">560 So. 2d 820</a> (La. 1990)</span> and <span class="cite"><i>In re:
  Pardue</i>, <a href="../SC/1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a> (La. 1994)</span>.  In <i>St. Romain</i>, the
  attorney was charged with, among other things, failure to communicate with a client before accepting a settlement and
  delegating this task to a non-lawyer assistant.  Ultimately, the attorney ended up paying an additional out-of-pocket
  sum to the client to meet car repair expenses she had incurred.  Based on this evidence, the court concluded that the
  client suffered no identifiable financial loss from the attorney's failure to communicate, and a formal public
  reprimand was deemed the appropriate sanction. <i>St. Romain</i>, 560 So. 2d at 824.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <i>Pardue</i>, the attorney failed to advise the client that suit had not been filed timely
  and had prescribed.  The attorney maintained that he informed the client of the fact that the case had prescribed
  nine months after the event while he was still negotiating a settlement with the defendants.  The client contended
  that she learned of the prescription issue two years later from contacting the clerk's office.  The court, accepting
  the attorney's version of events, concluded that failure for a period of several months to disclose the fact that
  suit was not timely filed constituted a violation of Rule <span class="Rules">1.4</span> and 8.4(c) warranting
  discipline.  <i>Id.</i> at 151.  Pardue was issued a formal public reprimand after the court considered several
  mitigating factors, including the extended delay in conducting the disciplinary process.  Significantly, the facts
  revealed that the defendants continued to extend offers of settlement after the client was made aware of the
  prescription issue.  <i>Id.</i> at 150-51.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This matter is similar to <i>St. Romain</i> and <i>Pardue</i> in that violations of Rule 1.4 are
  present.  The harm present in this case, however, is not as serious as that seen in <i>St. Romain</i> and
  <i>Pardue</i>.  ODC agrees with Respondent that Ms. Cash's chances of avoiding a judgment were virtually
  non-existent, and that her single chance of avoiding responsibility lay in a pending third-party demand against her
  ex-husband.  This claim can still be pursued if Ms. Cash so chooses.  The ODC agrees that Ms. Cash suffered "no
  direct financial loss directly attributable to [Respondent's] inaction."  Further, as noted earlier, Respondent has
  refunded $991.00 of the original fee in the form of a credit to a succession matter that the client asked Respondent
  to handle. </p>

  <h2><b>RULING</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the petition for consent discipline be accepted, and
  that a public reprimand be issued against Respondent for his violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. It is
  further ordered that Respondent be assessed the costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to
  commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this ruling until paid.</p>
