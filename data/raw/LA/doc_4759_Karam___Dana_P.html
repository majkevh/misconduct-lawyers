  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 04-OB-1031</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: DANA PATRICK KARAM</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ORDER</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into numerous complaints of
  serious professional misconduct filed against respondent.  The complaints allege that respondent practiced law while
  he was ineligible to do so for failing to pay his bar dues and the disciplinary assessment, engaged in a sexual
  relationship with a female client who retained him to represent her in a divorce and child custody matter, converted
  client funds, neglected legal matters, failed to communicate with his clients, failed to account for or refund
  unearned legal fees, failed to return files and to protect his clients' interests upon the termination of his
  representation, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Prior to the filing of formal charges, respondent filed a petition seeking to permanently resign
  from the practice of law in lieu of discipline.  The ODC has concurred in respondent's petition.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Having considered the Petition for Voluntary Permanent Resignation from the Practice of Law filed
  by Dana Patrick Karam, Louisiana Bar Roll number 18279, and the concurrence thereto filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel,</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the request of Dana Patrick Karam for permanent resignation in lieu of
  discipline be and is hereby granted, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 20.1 and Rule 5.5(c) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct, as amended March 24, 2004.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Dana Patrick Karam shall be permanently prohibited from practicing law
  in Louisiana or in any other jurisdiction in which he is admitted to the practice of law; shall be permanently
  prohibited from seeking readmission to the practice of law in this state or in any other jurisdiction in which he is
  admitted; and shall be permanently prohibited from seeking admission to the practice of law in any jurisdiction.</p>
