  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: ANDRE P. GAUTHIER</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NUMBER 00-DB-081</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">AMENDED RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a Joint Petition for Consent Discipline
  by Andre P. Gauthier (herein "Respondent") of Gonzales, Louisiana, and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (herein
  "ODC"). The Petition was filed following the institution of formal charges. For reasons stated below, the
  Disciplinary Board recommends that the Louisiana Supreme Court accept the Petition. </p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY </h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On June 20, 2000, Formal Charges, consisting of one count, were filed against Respondent. The
  Formal Charges allege that Respondent failed to provide competent representation to his client in violation of Rule
  <span class="allegedrules">1.1(a)</span><a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" class="fn" id="_ednref1">[i]</a> and
  violated the Rules of Professional Conduct through the acts of another in violation of Rule
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span>.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn" id="_ednref2">[ii]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On August 24, 2000, Respondent and ODC filed a Joint Petition for Consent Discipline, along with
  stipulated facts and a memorandum in support of the Petition.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Oral argument before the Disciplinary Board was held on November 30, 2000.Deputy Disciplinary
  Counsel James T. Daly represented the ODC. Respondent appeared and was represented by Mr. Harry S. Hardin III. After
  the oral argument, the parties were directed to file an additional memorandum addressing the applicability of a
  previous disciplinary case and the appropriate sanction to be imposed in this matter. Both parties complied. The
  Respondent filed his memorandum on December 5, 2000 and ODC filed its memorandum on December 11,
  2000.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" class="fn" id="_ednref3">[iii]</a></p>

  <p class="headingstyle"><b>STIPULATED FACTS</b></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In summary, the stipulated facts provide as follows:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC received a complaint against Respondent from Ms. Sharon B. Turner. Ms. Turner alleged that
  someone forged her signature as a mortgagor on a collateral mortgage, which Respondent later notarized. During the
  course of the investigation, it was determined that Respondent had prepared the mortgage and then given it to his
  client, the mortgagee. The mortgagee, Respondent's father-in-law, then gave the mortgage to Ms. Turner's husband,
  Stacy. After his client returned the signed mortgage to Respondent's office, Respondent notarized it even though none
  of the signators of the mortgage signed in his presence.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle"><b>JOINT PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</b></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent tenders a conditional admission to the misconduct in exchange for the stated form of
  discipline of public reprimand, with the following conditions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">a. Respondent shall attend three hours of continuing legal education in the area of small
    office practice/loss prevention, such as the "malpractice prevention seminar" presented by the Louisiana State Bar
    Association's Office of Loss Prevention, or its equivalent, within the next twelve months;</p>

    <p class="inverted">b.  Respondent shall take an additional hour each of MCLE ethics and professionalism within the
    next twelve months;</p>

    <p class="inverted">c. Respondent shall perform fifty hours of <i>pro bono</i> legal services for the Capital Area
    Legal Services in the Twenty-Third District Court within the next twelve months; </p>

    <p class="inverted">d.  Respondent shall provide proof to ODC of an indemnity agreement to Louis H. Stafford to
    indemnify Mr. Stafford for any amounts that Mr. Stafford is unable or unwilling to collect from Stacy Adam Turner,
    Jr., on the $40,000 collateral mortgage note dated September 30, 1998, with interest at the rate of 18% per annum
    from date until paid;</p>

    <p class="inverted">e.Respondent shall fully comply with all mandatory continuing legal education requirements, pay
    all bar dues, file any annual registration statements, and pay his yearly disciplinary assessment;</p>

    <p class="inverted">f.  Respondent shall fully comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct and cooperate promptly
    and fully with requests for information by ODC during the probation period;</p>

    <p class="inverted">g. Respondent shall be on probation until such time as the conditions set forth above have been
    fulfilled; and,</p>

    <p class="inverted">h. Respondent's failure to fulfill any probation condition shall, at the sole option of ODC,
    result in the re-opening of this matter for prosecution of discipline with respect to the underlying conduct
    complained of therein, as if a consent discipline had not occurred.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="headingstyle"> <b>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</b> </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.1(a)</span> and <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.The
  Board must accept that Respondent has violated these rules. <span class="cite"><i>In re Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La.
  6/7/96); <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given the violation of these rules, the
  Board is left to determine if the proposed sanction is appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A review of the record indicates that Respondent negligently violated duties owed to his client
  and to the profession. While the proposed discipline includes indemnification of the client, Respondent's actions had
  the potential to cause serious injury to his client.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  The stipulated facts include the following mitigating factors: 9.32(a)
  (<span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>), 9.32(b) (<span class="ABAstandard">absence
  of a dishonest or selfish motive</span>), 9.32(d) (<span class="ABAstandard">timely good faith effort to make
  restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct</span>), 9.32(e) (<span class="ABAstandard">full and free
  disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings</span>), 9.32(g)
  (<span class="ABAstandard">good character and reputation in the community</span>), and 9.32(l)
  (<span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>). ODC and Respondent state that no aggravating factors are present in this
  matter. After reviewing the record, the Board finds that the mitigating factors listed above are present. Further,
  the Board agrees that no aggravating factors exist here.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle"><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>

  <h3><b>I.</b> ABA Standards</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanction</i>
  (herein "Standard") to determine the baseline sanction by examining "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's mental
  state and the extent of the injury caused; and then adjust[ing] the sanction in accordance with the aggravating and
  mitigating factors present." <span class="cite"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94);
  <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 350</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Without citing specific references, ODC states that the ABA guidelines suggest a public reprimand
  as the appropriate baseline sanction in this matter. Standard <span class="ABAstandard">7.3</span> provides for
  reprimand "when a lawyer negligently engages in conduct that is a violation of duty owed as a professional, and
  causes injury to potential injury to a client, the public, or the legal system." Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.53</span> provides for reprimand "when a lawyer demonstrates failure to understand
  relevant legal doctrines or procedures and causes injury or potential injury to a client; or is negligent in
  determining whether he or she is competent to handle a legal matter and causes injury or potential injury to a
  client."<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" class="fn" id="_ednref4">[iv]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon the above, the ABA guidelines suggest that Respondent's actions warrant a public
  reprimand.</p>

  <h3><b>II. </b>Relevant Case Law</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board also looks to relevant case law for assistance in determining an appropriate sanction
  for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. ODC cites <span class="cite"><i>In re Wahlder</i>, 98-2742 (La.
  1/15/99), <a href="../SC/1999-01-15_1998-2742.htm">728 So. 2d 837</a></span>, and <span class="cite"><i>In re
  Sellers</i>, 95-2764 (La. 3/15/96); <a href="../SC/1996-03-15_1995-2764.htm">669 So. 2d 1204</a></span>, in support
  of the proposed sanction. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <i>Wahlder</i>, the Court imposed a six month deferred suspension, subject to the completion
  of one year of supervised probation with conditions, upon an attorney who directed an employee to notarize the
  signature of a client's wife, despite her absence at the time the documents was notarized. Wahlder also improperly
  acted as a "witness" to the signature of the wife. Additionally, he failed to notify the trial court and opposing
  counsel of this discrepancy when the couple subsequently divorced and he discovered that the husband had signed the
  documents on his wife's behalf without her knowledge. The Court found that Wahlder's actions violated Rule 4.1(a)
  (knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a third person), Rule 8.4(a) (violating the Rules of
  Professional Conduct), Rule 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving fraud, deceit, dishonesty or misrepresentation),
  and Rule 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <i>Sellers</i>, the Court imposed a public reprimand for an attorney's failure to disclose the
  existence of a collateral mortgage to a third party when disclosure was necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or
  fraudulent act by a client in violation of Rule of Professional Conduct 4.1(b). Sellers served as a notary for two
  real estate transactions. The first transaction involved a collateral mortgage on a one-third interest in certain
  property. The second transaction involved the sale of the same property. Pursuant to instructions received from his
  client, Sellers did not mention the existence of the collateral mortgage at any time to the buyer. Furthermore, the
  act of sale contained boilerplate language that warranted that the property seller was transferring to the buyer was
  clear of all liens and encumbrances, as well as language to the effect that the notary (Sellers) was in possession of
  mortgage certificates that reflected that the property was free and clear.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon the above, the jurisprudence suggests that Respondent's actions warrant a public
  reprimand or a deferred suspension.</p>

  <h3><b>III.  </b> Conclusion</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon the ABA guidelines and jurisprudence from the Court, a sanction of a public reprimand
  or deferred suspension is appropriate for Respondent's violation of Rules <span class="Rules">1.1(a)</span> and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The presence of mitigating factors in this
  matter, coupled with the agreed upon conditions, suggest that the proposed consent discipline of public reprimand is
  the appropriate sanction for Respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <h2><b>RULING</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, for the reasons assigned above, the Disciplinary Board accepts the Joint Petition
  for Consent Discipline filed by the Respondent, Andre P. Gauthier, and ODC.The Board therefore orders that the
  Respondent receive a public reprimand, along with the following conditions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">a.    Respondent shall attend three hours of continuing legal education in the area of small
    office practice/loss prevention, such as the "malpractice prevention seminar" presented by the Louisiana State Bar
    Association's Office of Loss Prevention, or its equivalent, within the next twelve months;</p>

    <p class="inverted">b.   Respondent shall take an additional hour each of MCLE ethics and professionalism within
    the next twelve months;</p>

    <p class="inverted">c.    Respondent shall perform fifty hours of <i>pro bono</i> legal services for the Capital
    Area Legal Services in the Twenty-Third District Court within the next twelve months;</p>

    <p class="inverted">d.    Respondent shall provide proof to ODC of an indemnity agreement to Louis H. Stafford to
    indemnify Mr. Stafford for any amounts that Mr. Stafford is unable or unwilling to collect from Stacy Adam Turner,
    Jr., on the $40,000 collateral mortgage note dated September 30, 1998, with interest at the rate of 18% per annum
    from date until paid;</p>

    <p class="inverted">e.    Respondent shall fully comply with all mandatory continuing legal education requirements,
    pay all bar dues, file any annual registration statements, and pay his yearly disciplinary assessment;</p>

    <p class="inverted">f.     Respondent shall fully comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct and cooperate
    promptly and fully with requests for information by ODC during the probation period;</p>

    <p class="inverted">g.    Respondent shall be on probation until such time as the conditions set forth above have
    been fulfilled; and,</p>

    <p class="inverted">h.    Respondent's failure to fulfill any probation condition shall, at the sole option of ODC,
    result in the re-opening of this matter for prosecution of discipline with respect to the underlying conduct
    complained of therein, as if a consent discipline had not occurred.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board also orders that all costs and expenses of these proceedings be assessed to Respondent,
  with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this Ruling until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref3" name="_edn3" class="fn" id="_edn3">[iii]</a> At the oral argument, the

  (La. 3/26/93); <a  href="../SC/1993-03-26_1992-3332.htm">615 So.2d 1333</a></span>.Both parties argued
  that the facts of <i>Broome</i> are distinguishable from the case at hand and that the sanction imposed in
  <i>Broome</i>, a ninety day suspension, would be too harsh here.After careful consideration, the Board agrees that a
  ninety day suspension would be too severe in this matter.As pointed out by the parties, here the Respondent's
  misconduct was based on his failure to require the mortgagors to sign the documents in his presence, while Mr.
  Broome's misconduct was based on his gross negligence in supervising his employees, a violation of Rule 5.3.Further,
  Mr. Broome, who was charged with nine separate rule violations, failed to acknowledge the serious nature of the
  fraudulent conduct of his legal staff.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref4" name="_edn4" class="fn" id="_edn4">[iv]</a>The facts of this matter are
  difficult to evaluate under the language of the four standards relating to lack of competence, including Standard
  4.53, and their commentaries. However, since Respondent has admitted to lack of competence in this matter, Standard
  4.53 appears to be the one that most closely addresses the issues raised in this matter.</p>

    <p class="headingstyle">Docket No. 00-DB-081</p>

    <p class="headingstyle">Andre P. Gauthier</p>

    <p class="headingstyle">Concurrence, with limited dissent:</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy"> The consent discipline public reprimand in this case carries eight conditions and provides
    that Respondent "shall be on probation until such time as the conditions ...have been fulfilled." I have a problem
    with condition (c) which requires Respondent to "perform fifty hours of <u>pro</u> <u>bono</u> legal services for
    the Capital Area Legal Services in the Twenty-Third District Court within the next twelve months." </p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">While I support and applaud <u>pro</u> <u>bono</u> legal services, I am uncomfortable with the
    notion of requiring <u>pro</u> <u>bono</u> services as a condition of probation in a disciplinary matter. Because
    Respondent has consented to it does not relieve the tension.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">Supreme Court Rule XIX, Sec. 10, provides for probation and requires only that the conditions
    of probation be in writing. The ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 Ed.) in its Commentary on Section
    2.7 says that "probation is a sanction that should be imposed when a lawyer's right to practice law needs to be
    monitored or limited rather than revoked." I believe that the commentary has been amended to say also that
    "probation is appropriate for conduct which may be corrected. "The commentary also says, "By imposing probation the
    Court allows a lawyer to continue to practice, but also requires the lawyer to meet certain conditions that will
    protect the public and assist the lawyer to meet ethical obligations."</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">I recognize that RPC 6.1 says that "a lawyer should render public interest legal service," and
    I agree that condition (c) of the proposed probation certainly would assist Respondent to meet his ethical
    obligation under RPC 6.1, but I think it's clear that this disciplinary proceeding has nothing whatever to do with
    Respondent's RPC 6.1 duties. There is no showing whatever that Respondent does not meet such duties wholly
    independent of these proceedings. I doubt very strongly whether anyone is willing to use the disciplinary process
    to enforce RPC 6.1.I therefore think that condition (c) is improper and should not be a condition of probation.</p>
