<p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="headingstyle">NO. 07-B-0556</p>
<p class="headingstyle">IN RE: SHEILA WHARTON</p>
<p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of
Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Sheila Wharton, an attorney
licensed to practice law in Louisiana, but currently suspended from practice.</p>
<h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Before we address the current charges, we find it helpful to review respondent's
prior disciplinary history. Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in
Louisiana in 1972. In 2003, this court considered a proceeding involving two 
sets of
formal charges against respondent for misconduct that occurred between 1996 and
2000. These charges alleged that respondent failed to communicate with clients,
neglected legal matters, refused to refund unearned fees, and failed to 
cooperate with
the ODC in its investigation. After considering the record, we imposed a 
three-year
suspension. In re: Wharton, 03-1816 (La. 10/17/03), 872 So. 2d 459 ("Wharton 
I").
Respondent has not sought reinstatement from this suspension, and accordingly, 
she
remains suspended from the practice of law.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Against this backdrop, we now turn to a consideration of the misconduct at
issue in the present proceeding.</p>
<h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>
<h3>Count I – The White Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In August 2002, Fredia Culpepper White paid respondent $500 to handle her
mother's succession. Ms. White obtained the documentation respondent requested
and met again with respondent in July 2003. Thereafter, Ms. White's repeated
attempts to contact respondent were unsuccessful. In November 2003, Ms. White
filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC, to which respondent failed to
reply. In June 2004, Ms. White advised the ODC that due to respondent's neglect, 
the
house which was to be part of her mother's succession may have been repossessed 
by
the bank. Ms. White also reported that she and a relative were forced to pay 
another
attorney $3,000 to complete the succession.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As a result of respondent's suspension from the practice of law in Wharton I,
a curator was appointed in 2004 to inventory her client files. Neither the ODC 
nor the
curator were able to locate respondent despite numerous documented attempts to 
do
so.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent's conduct in the White matter violated the
following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules 1.3 (failure to 
act
with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), 1.4 (failure 
to
communicate with a client), 1.5(f)(6) (failure to refund an unearned fee), and 
8.1(c)
(failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation).</p>
<h3>Count II – The Gillins Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In April 2003, Debbie Gillins retained respondent to handle her divorce. At the
time the representation commenced, Ms. Gillins paid respondent $395, with the
understanding that respondent would file a petition for divorce. Two weeks 
later, Ms.
Gillins paid respondent an additional $425, for a total of $820. Thereafter, Ms.
Gillins' numerous attempts to contact respondent were unsuccessful. In January 
2004,
Ms. Gillins filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC, reporting that 
she had
been forced to delay her plans to remarry due to respondent's abandonment of her
case. Respondent failed to reply to the complaint.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent's conduct in the Gillins matter violated the
following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules 1.3, 1.4, 
1.5(f)(6),
and 8.1(c).</p>
<h3>Count III – The Frame Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In June 2003, Timothy Frame retained respondent to handle a child custody
matter. Mr. Frame paid respondent $1,500 for the representation. In August 2003,
respondent sent Mr. Frame a copy of the petition for approval. Respondent
represented to Mr. Frame that she had forwarded the petition to the Sheriff's 
Office
for service on Mr. Frame's former wife. Thereafter, Mr. Frame's numerous 
attempts
to contact respondent were unsuccessful, and he learned through direct contact 
with
the Sheriff's Office that no service or other activity had occurred in his 
matter since
September 2002. In January 2004, Mr. Frame sent a certified letter to respondent
terminating the representation and demanding a refund. Respondent did not claim 
the
letter and refused to return calls or refund fees, leading Mr. Frame to file a 
complaint
with the ODC in February 2004. Respondent failed to reply to the complaint.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent's conduct in the Frame matter violated the
following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules 1.3, 1.4, 
1.5(f)(6),
1.16(d) (obligations upon termination of the representation), and 8.1(c).</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">In April 2005, the ODC filed three counts of formal charges against respondent,
as set forth above. Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal
charges. Accordingly, the factual allegations contained therein were deemed 
admitted
and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX,
§ 11(E)(3). No formal hearing was held, but the parties were given an 
opportunity to
file with the hearing committee written arguments and documentary evidence on 
the
issue of sanctions. Respondent filed nothing for the hearing committee's
consideration.</p>
<h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2006-07-24_05-DB-044.htm">Hearing Committee Report</a></span></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee determined that the factual allegations of the formal
charges were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence 
pursuant
to Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). The committee also determined that respondent violated 
the
Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on these findings, the committee determined that respondent knowingly
and intentionally violated duties owed to her clients. Respondent failed to 
perform
services, thereby jeopardizing her clients' legal matters and delaying 
resolution of
their cases. Respondent's failure to refund any unearned portion of the fees 
received
from her clients continues to deprive the clients of funds rightfully owed them. 
The
baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is a period of suspension.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The committee found that the following aggravating factors are present: prior
disciplinary offenses, a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, and bad faith
obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply 
with the
rules or orders of the disciplinary agency. The committee found no mitigating 
factors.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering the court's prior jurisprudence, the committee determined that a
lengthy suspension would ordinarily be appropriate for respondent's misconduct.
However, in light of the numerous aggravating factors present, including 
respondent's
previous suspension in Wharton I, as well as her continuing failure to cooperate 
in the
disciplinary investigations, the committee recommended that respondent be 
disbarred.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's
recommendation.</p>
<h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2007-03-16_05-DB-044.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board concurred in the findings of the hearing committee that
respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as set forth in the formal
charges, and that the charges were deemed admitted and proven by clear and
convincing evidence.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The board determined that respondent violated duties owed to her clients and
to the profession. Given the pattern of misconduct, respondent's actions can 
only be
described as knowing and intentional. Ms. White, Ms. Gillins, and Mr. Frame have
all been injured by respondent's failure to return their legal fees and failure 
to
complete their legal matters. The disciplinary system has been harmed in that 
the
ODC has been forced to expend additional resources in its numerous attempts to
contact respondent to obtain information for its investigation.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The board found that the following aggravating factors are present: prior
disciplinary offenses, a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, bad faith 
obstruction
of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the rules 
or
orders of the disciplinary agency, substantial experience in the practice of law
(admitted 1972), and indifference to making restitution. The board agreed with 
the
hearing committee that no mitigating factors are present.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Likewise, the board agreed that the applicable baseline sanction in this matter
is suspension, but that an upward deviation to disbarment is warranted under the
circumstances. Numerous aggravating factors are present in this case, and 
respondent
was previously suspended for three years for similar misconduct. She has failed 
to
refund unearned fees to three clients totaling some $2,820, and she has 
repeatedly
failed to cooperate with the ODC in its attempt to investigate the charges in 
this
matter.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on this reasoning, the board recommended that respondent be disbarred.
The board also recommended that respondent be ordered to provide an accounting
and/or make restitution to her clients, and that she be assessed with all costs 
and
expenses of these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's
recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. 
La.
Const. art. V, § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an
independent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has
been proven by clear and convincing evidence. In re: Quaid, 94-1316 (La. 
11/30/94),
646 So. 2d 343, 348; Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall, 597 So. 2d 444, 445 
(La.
1992). While we are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of
the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error
standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings. See In re: 
Caulfield,
96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), 683 So. 2d 714; In re: Pardue, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94), 
633
So. 2d 150.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record of this deemed admitted proceeding reveals that respondent
neglected legal matters, failed to communicate with her clients, failed to 
account for
or refund unearned fees paid by her clients, failed to return a client's file, 
and failed
to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation. This conduct clearly falls below 
the
standards expected of a lawyer licensed to practice law in this state and, most
disappointingly, is markedly similar to that which we saw in Wharton I.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional misconduct, we now turn to a discussion of an
appropriate sanction. In considering that issue, we are mindful that 
disciplinary
proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the 
public,
preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. Louisiana 
State
Bar Ass'n v. Reis, 513 So. 2d 1173 (La. 1987). The discipline to be imposed 
depends
upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, 
considered
in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Louisiana State Bar 
Ass'n
v. Whittington, 459 So. 2d 520 (La. 1984).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent violated duties owed to her clients and as a professional.
Undoubtedly, she acted knowingly, if not intentionally, and caused actual harm 
to her
clients. The baseline sanction for this misconduct is a period of suspension.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Several significant aggravating factors are present in the instant case, 
including<br>
respondent's prior three-year suspension in Wharton I for nearly identical 
misconduct.
Respondent's pattern of misconduct caused actual harm to her clients, and her 
total
disregard for her professional obligations indicates that she poses a 
substantial danger
to the public. Respondent's continued indifference to rectifying the 
consequences of
her misconduct is evident not only in her lack of response in the disciplinary
proceedings, but in the timing of the misconduct, which occurred while the 
Wharton
I proceedings were ongoing. There are no mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering the numerous aggravating factors present, respondent's prior
suspension, and the unearned fees that still have not been refunded to three 
clients, we
cannot say the board's recommendation of disbarment is inappropriate. 
Accordingly,
we will disbar respondent.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee
and disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that Sheila 
Ann
Wharton, Louisiana Bar Roll number 13391, be disbarred. Her name shall be 
stricken
from the roll of attorneys and her license to practice law in the State of 
Louisiana shall
be revoked. It is further ordered that respondent shall provide accountings to 
her
clients subject of the formal charges and make full restitution of any unearned 
legal
fees. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in
accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence
thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
