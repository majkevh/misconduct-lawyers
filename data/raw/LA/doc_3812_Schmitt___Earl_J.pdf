No. 64245.<br>
<b>In Re: Earl J. SCHMITT, Jr.<br>
</b></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED, That Earl J. Schmitt, Jr., be allowed to surrender his license to practice law; that the name of Earl J. Schmitt, Jr., be stricken from the Rolls of Attorneys thus resulting in the disbarment of Earl J. Schmitt, Jr., on his consent, effective the date of his suspension, January 18, 1977.<br>
<span class="BodyText2">DIXON and MARCUS, JJ., dissent, being of the opinion this resignation should be effective from this date, no adequate showing of restitution having been made.<br>
CALOGERO, J., concurs.&nbsp; The action of this Court here does not promise readmission of this applicant.&nbsp; He may simply apply for re-admission two years sooner than he might otherwise.&nbsp; By this action formal disbarment proceedings and attendant delays are obviated.</span></p>
