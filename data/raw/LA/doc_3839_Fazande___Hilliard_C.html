</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<u>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</u></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080"><b>LEMMON, </b></font><font size="3" color="#000080">Justice.<br>
</font><font size="3">The Louisiana State Bar Association, through its Committee on Professional Responsibility, brought this disciplinary action against Hilliard C. Fazande, II, contending that he had violated disciplinary rules as detailed-in eight specifications.&nbsp; The commissioner, after a hearing, found that four of the eight charges had been substantiated by the evidence and that respondent had violated </font>(A)(1)(4) and (6), (A)(3), (A)(2) and . <font size="3" color="#000000">The commissioner recommended that the respondent be suspended from practice, but did not recommend a specific period.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The Bar Association concurred in the commissioner'</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">s&nbsp; findings as to the violations and suggested a suspension of three years. </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="1" color="#000080"><sup>2</sup></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"> Respondent filed exceptions to the commissioner's report and now contends in this court that the evidence did not support the commissioner's findings that he violated the disciplinary rules.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">In Specification No. 2, the commissioner found that Mrs&nbsp; Sheila Williams retained respondent to obtain a legal separation in January, 1977, and paid him a fee of $450, plus costs of $98.15. Respondent appeared for Mrs. Williams at a rule for child support and alimony, but failed to obtain the separation or to enforce the support judgment.&nbsp; When Mrs. Williams was unable to communicate with respondent for six to eight months, she retained other counsel to complete the separation.&nbsp; Although Mrs. Williams requested that respondent return the fee, he has not yet returned any portion of it.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">The Commissioner concluded that respondent hacl violated</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#800000"> </font>(A)(3)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">by neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him and </font>(A)(2) <font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">by failing to carry out a contract of employment.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Respondent contends that all that remained in his representation was a final hearing and that he had done substantial work toward completion of the litigation before he was discharged.&nbsp; He points out that the $450 fee was quoted for an uncontested separation and that he did not increase the fee when the husband filed responsive pleadings.&nbsp; He further contends that Mrs.&nbsp; Williams demanded the return of the entire fee and refused to accept an offer (made through the committee in October, 1978) of a partial refund.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the Bar Association proved by clear and convincing evidence that respondent accepted employment and a retainer from Mrs. Wilklams, neglected the matter by failing to respond to her calls or correspondence, failed to complete the employment, forcing the client to employ another lawyer to obtain the separation, and failed to refund any portion of the fee (or even offer to do so until contacted by the Bar Association).</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">In Specification No. 3, the commissioner found that respondent had been retained in February, 1977, by Mr. and Mrs. Larry Coleman to handle an appeal involving their suspension from participation in a federal food stamp program.&nbsp; Respondent had entered the case in the district court, after two previous lawyers had withdrawn and the government had filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the period of suspension had already elapses and the matter was moot.&nbsp; After the trial court granted the motion to dismiss, the clients agreed to pay respondent a $2,000 fee for the appeal and paid half of it in March of 1977.&nbsp; They had earlier paid him a $450 fee, which (they contended in the hearing) was for services in opposing the dismissal in the trial court.&nbsp; In October, 1978, after respondent had repeatedly told them he was waiting for a hearing date, the clients learned that the appeal had been dismissed in June, 1977, because of respondent</font><font face='Courier New' size="2">=</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">s failure to file a brief.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">The commissioner concluded that respondent violated</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#800000"> </font>(A)(3) <font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">by neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him, resulting in the dismissal of the appeal.&nbsp; The commissioner further concluded that respondent had violated </font>(A)(1)(4)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"> by attempting to deceive his clients when he knew or should have known that the appeal had been dismissed.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Respondent contends that the commissioner erred in believing the unreliable testimony of the clients.&nbsp; He testified that they instructed him to dismiss the appeal after he discussed the possibility that criminal charges might still be brought against one of them in connection with the food stamp suspension.&nbsp; He further contends that the $1,000 payment was for his representation in the district court on the food stamp matter and that the other $450 fee was for his services in obtaining a new trial and acquittal for Mrs. Coleman on criminal charges in municipal court. </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="1" color="#000080"><sup>3</sup></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"> He also points out that the clients never requested a refund.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the Bar Association proved that respondent not only accepted a fee for an appeal and never completed the matter or returned the fee, but also deceived his clients by telling them he was waiting for a hearing date, when the appeal had been </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b>dismissed because </b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">of his failure to file a </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b>brief.&nbsp; As </b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><i>a</i></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> result, the clients lost their rights to an appeal.&nbsp; Additionally disturbing was respondent</font><font face='Courier New' size="2">=</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">s blaming the delay on the courts, a cover-up which brought undeserved disrepute upon the judicial system.&nbsp; Finally, the fact that the appeal was dismissed involuntarily for failure to file a brief, and not voluntarily on respondent</font><font face='Courier New' size="2">=</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">s motions, </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b>refutes </b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">respondent's version that his clients instructed him to dismiss the appeal.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">In Specification No. 5, the commissioner found that respondent, in handling a personal injury claim for two clients, guaranteed payment to the St. Bernard Medical Center of certain medical bills.&nbsp; After receipt of settlement funds in late 1976, respondent in August, 1977 issued two checks in </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><u>partial</u></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> payment of the bills, but the checks were returned because of insufficient funds.&nbsp; On June 23, 1979, the medical center wrote to respondent demanding payment under threats of prosecution.&nbsp; On July 23, 1979, the medical center contacted the Bar Association and executed an affidavit in preparation for the filing of criminal charges.&nbsp; Respondent finally paid the bill in full.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">The commissioner concluded that respondent had violated</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#800000"> </font> <font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">by converting to his own use funds derived from his clients</font><font face='Courier New' size="2" color="#000000">=</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"> settlement.&nbsp; Additionally, the commissioner found that respondent had violated</font> (A)(1)(4)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">by engaging in dishonest and fraudulent conduct in the issuance of the NSF checks.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Respondent contends that the commissioner improperly excluded evidence that he issued the checks to the St. Bernard Medical Center pursuant to an agreement with Dr. Emile Bertucci that the checks would be held until respondent approved their deposit, when his financial position improved.&nbsp; The agreement to hold the checks, according to respondent, was not misuse of a client's funds, but was the equivalent of his payment of the medical bills and Dr. Bertucci</font><font face='Courier New' size="2">=</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">s making a personal loan to respondent.&nbsp; In respondent's view, the agreement went awy when Dr. Bertucci</font><font face='Courier New' size="2">=</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">s son, the center</font><font face='Courier New' size="2">=</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">s financial manager, deposited the checks without knowing of the agreement.&nbsp; Respondent points out that the medical center (and not his clients) filed the complaint against him and that his clients were never contacted for payment.&nbsp; Respondent further argues that the letter agreement from Dr. Bertucci (which he attempted to introduce, but which was excluded as hearsay) supports his version of the facts and proves that he neither issued the checks with intent to defraud nor converted to his own use his clients' funds.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Upon reviewing the record, we have examined Dr. Bertucci</font><font face='Courier New' size="2">=</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">s letters, which were proffered after being excluded from evidence. </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="1" color="#000080"><sup>4</sup></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"> In October, 1976, Dr. Bertucci agreed to extend the time for settling the account.&nbsp; In September, 1977, Dr. Bertucci verified his agreement to hold the checks and explained that the checks had been deposited inadvertently.&nbsp; And in a December, 1981 letter addressed&nbsp; To Whom It May Concern, Dr. Bertucci indicated that he was not anxious to puruse the matter further and that he was not aware of any action for collection that had been taken beyond his personal authority.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Under the totality of evidence, we conclude that the Bar Association did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent issued the two checks with</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"> client (or to third parties as directed by the clients) funds which the clients were entitled to receive.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">In Specification No. 7, the respondent agreed in April, 1977, to represent 31 men in a labor dispute at a charge of $200 per man (or a total fee of $6,200 ) </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><i>as a</i></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> nonrefundable retainer to be credited against a one-third contingency fee.&nbsp; Respondent was to appeal a district court decision and then seek further review, if necessary.&nbsp; Respondent received only $3,200 because some of the men decided not to participate in the appeal.&nbsp; The commissioner found that respondent did not file the appeal or any other pleadings on behalf of the remaining clients, nor did he respond to their attempts to communicate with him after April of 1977 or refund any of the fee.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">The commissioner concluded that respondent had violated </font>(A)(2)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">by failing to carry out a contract of employment and </font>(A)(l)(4)(6)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"> by engaging in conduct involving misrepresentation.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Respondent testified that he had quoted the clients a fee of $6,000 and had only been paid about $3,000.&nbsp; He asserted that he earned the partial fee by reviewing the voluminous file while awaiting payment of the balance of the fee, and he further testified that he notified the clients that their appeal lacked merit, offering to meet with them and explain further.&nbsp; He admitted, however, that he never directed a letter to the clients advising that he was not proceeding with the appeal.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">After reviewing the record, we conclude the respondent collected a fee in excess of $3,000, but did not file the appeal or give appropriate notice to his clients that he was not going to pursue the matter, thereby causing them to lose their appeal rights.&nbsp; We further conclude that respondent failed to communicate and discuss the matter with his clients or to return the fee.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">In overall mitigation, respondent argues that all four complaints were lodged within a short period of time and were the first against him since he began the practice or law in 1971.&nbsp; He further points out that he gave up his private practice in 1979.&nbsp; Finally, he argues that his professional conduct did not fall below the minimum standard required by the disciplinary rules and that suspension is unwarranted by the facts.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">The purpose of attorney disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to maintain appropriate standards of professional conduct in order to safeguard the public, preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility. 1980</font><font face='Arial' size="2" color="#008000"> Louisiana State Bar Ass</font><font face='Courier New' size="2" color="#008000">=</font><font face='Arial' size="2" color="#008000">n. v. Causey, 393 So. 2nd 88 (La.</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">).&nbsp; We agree with the commissioner</font><font face='Courier New' size="2" color="#000000">=</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">s findings that respondent violated </font>(A)(3) <font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">by neglecting legal matters entrusted to him, </font>(A)(2) <font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">by failing to carry out contracts of employment, and </font>(A)(4)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"> by engaging in misconduct involving misrepresentation.&nbsp; Failing to perform legal services for which an attorney has been paid, allowing a client to lose his right of appeal because of inaction, and misrepresenting the status of litigation by blaming the judicial system for delays are serious violations which warrant suspension from practice.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Accordingly, it is ordered that Hilliard C. Fazande, II be </font>suspended<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> from the practice of law in the State of Louisiana for a period of </font>thirty months, <font face='Times New Roman' size="3">effective upon the date of the finality of this decree.&nbsp; All costs of&nbsp; this proceeding shall be paid by the respondent.</font></p>
