  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-0035</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: PAUL J. YAEGER</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, Paul J. Yaeger, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana but currently on
  interim suspension.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In September 1997, pursuant to a petition for consent discipline, this court suspended respondent
  from the practice of law for eighteen months, with all but three months deferred, followed by a two-year period of
  supervised probation with conditions. <span class="cite">In re: Yaeger, 97-1610, 97-1611, 97-1612 (La. 9/5/97),
  <a href="1997-09-05_1997-1610.htm">698 So. 2d 951</a></span>. In February 1999, the ODC filed a rule to revoke
  respondent's probation after receiving complaints that he was practicing law during the period of his suspension. In
  March 1999, the rule to revoke probation was stayed when this court transferred respondent to disability inactive
  status, based on his allegation that he was severely depressed and unable to defend himself in the pending
  proceedings. At respondent's request, he was reinstated to active status on October 4, 2000, thereby permitting the
  disciplinary proceedings to resume. <span class="cite">In re: Yaeger, 00-2519 (La. 10/4/00),
  <a href="2000-10-04_2000-2519.htm">769 So. 2d 1179</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Meanwhile, in April 1999, respondent was arrested and charged with felony theft in Jefferson
  Parish. He pleaded guilty to three counts of felony theft in February 2000. Following the guilty plea, and
  respondent's reinstatement to active status, he was placed on interim suspension based on his conviction of a serious
  crime. <span class="cite">In re: Yaeger, 00-3523 (La. 1/26/01), <a href="2001-01-26_2000-3523.htm">777 So. 2d
  1220</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In March 2001, prior to the filing of formal charges, respondent and the ODC filed a joint
  petition for consent discipline. The parties proposed that respondent be disbarred for his criminal conviction as
  well as the misconduct at issue in some fifteen disciplinary investigations that were then pending. On August 1,
  2001, the disciplinary board recommended that the petition for consent discipline be accepted and that respondent be
  disbarred. On April 10, 2002, this court rejected the proposed consent discipline and remanded the matter for the
  institution of formal charges, with the instruction that on remand "the hearing committee and disciplinary board may
  consider recommendation of the sanction of permanent disbarment, if appropriate, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX,
  §§ 10(a) and 24, as amended effective August 1, 2001." <span class="cite">In re: Yaeger, 01-2259 (La. 4/10/02),
  <a href="2002-04-10_2001-2259.htm">819 So. 2d 278</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On August 14, 2002, the ODC filed fifteen counts of formal charges against respondent. Respondent
  answered the formal charges and essentially admitted his misconduct, but requested a hearing in mitigation. At the
  hearing, the parties entered into a joint stipulation in which respondent admitted to the misconduct as alleged in
  the formal charges. These stipulations may be summarized as follows:</p>

  <h3>Count I</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In September 1997, respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law while he was suspended
  from practice. Respondent was notified of the complaint, but failed to respond, necessitating the issuance of a
  subpoena to compel his response. The ODC and respondent stipulated that respondent's conduct violated Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">5.5(a)</span> (engaging in the unauthorized practice of law),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation), and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count II</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent settled a personal injury case for a client and withheld funds to pay the client's
  medical provider, but nevertheless failed to pay the provider promptly. Respondent finally paid the medical provider
  $1,000, but the check, drawn on his client trust account, was returned NSF. Respondent was notified of the complaint,
  but failed to respond, necessitating the issuance of a subpoena to compel his response. The ODC and respondent
  stipulated that respondent's conduct violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.15(a)</span> (safekeeping property
  of clients or third persons), <span class="allegedrules">1.15(b)</span> (failure to promptly deliver funds to a

  <h3>Count III</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was retained to represent Denise Stewart in a personal injury matter. Respondent
  failed to keep his client informed about the case, including settlement offers. When respondent settled Ms. Stewart's
  case, he withheld funds to pay her medical providers, but nevertheless failed to pay the providers promptly.
  Respondent also failed to promptly pay Ms. Stewart her portion of the settlement proceeds. He finally paid Ms.
  Stewart $4,361, but the check, drawn on his client trust account, was returned NSF. Respondent was notified of the
  complaint in this matter, but failed to respond, necessitating the issuance of a subpoena to compel his response.
  Respondent failed to appear.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC and respondent stipulated that respondent's conduct violated Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a client), 1.15(a), 1.15(b), 8.1(c), and 8.4(g) of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  Stewart - $730; (f) medical records - $61.50; (g) Sabrina Lamonte - $978; and (h) Gary Lamonte - $75. Eventually,
  respondent paid the amounts owed by the Stewarts, but only after the checks, drawn on his client trust account, had
  been returned NSF. The other balances remain unpaid. In addition, in the case of each of the settlements listed,
  respondent failed to promptly pay his clients their portions of the settlement proceeds. Respondent was notified of
  the complaint in this matter, but failed to respond, necessitating the issuance of a subpoena to compel his response.
  Respondent failed to appear.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC and respondent stipulated that respondent's conduct violated Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.15(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.15(b)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span>, and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count V</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Between March and May 1999, respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law while he was
  on disability inactive status. Respondent also notarized the signature of a client on settlement documents ten days
  after the client's death.</p>

  settled Ms. Dickerson's case without her knowledge or consent and failed to promptly pay Ms. Dickerson her portion of
  the settlement proceeds.</p>

  1.15(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count VII</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On February 1, 2000, respondent pleaded guilty in the 24th Judicial District Court for the Parish

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Hearing</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent presented mitigating evidence at the formal hearing. In particular, respondent
  testified that he has suffered from anxiety and severe depression since 1995. Respondent stated that he did not
  initially seek treatment for his condition, but instead self-medicated with alcohol, which "only exacerbated the
  symptoms and made my life completely miserable." After two failed suicide attempts, respondent finally sought
  psychiatric help in mid-1998, and he was admitted to DePaul Hospital for intensive in-patient treatment in 1999.
  Since that time respondent has learned to manage his condition and has resumed a functioning life; he is presently
  employed as an able-bodied seaman and is working to obtain his captain's license to operate offshore oil field supply
  vessels. Respondent testified that he accepts responsibility for his actions and made restitution to the individuals
  he harmed. Respondent is currently paying court-ordered restitution of $1,500 per month to the finance company that
  was a victim of his criminal conduct.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-04-30_02-DB-082.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee accepted the stipulated facts and rule violations and determined that the
  applicable baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is permanent disbarment. The committee found the ODC proved
  by clear and convincing evidence that respondent engaged in repeated or multiple instances of intentional conversion
  of client funds which caused substantial harm (Guideline 1 of the permanent disbarment guidelines set forth in
  Appendix E of Supreme Court Rule XIX), and that he engaged in the unauthorized practice of law after being suspended
  by this court (Guideline 8).<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a> Nevertheless, considering the
  mitigating factors present, the committee recommended that respondent be disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's failure to recommend permanent
  disbarment.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-12-16_02-DB-082.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board found that in committing the stipulated misconduct, respondent intentionally violated
  duties owed to his clients, the public, and as a professional. He caused injury to numerous clients and to third
  parties by depriving them of their funds. Respondent settled the claims of several clients without their knowledge or
  consent and converted the funds. He pleaded guilty to theft of more than $165,000. Although all individuals have now
  been paid, the receipt of funds was delayed. At least one client lost her legal right to pursue claims against
  certain defendants. By his criminal conduct, respondent caused injury to the profession and placed an added burden on
  the criminal justice system, causing injury to the public. He also damaged the profession by his initial failure to
  cooperate with the ODC, placing an added burden on the disciplinary system, and by engaging in the unauthorized
  practice of law. The board determined that the baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board recognized the mitigating factors found by the hearing committee, and agreed that those
  factors are supported by the record. However, the board disagreed that these mitigating factors justify the
  imposition of disbarment rather than permanent disbarment. In light of "the nature and extent of the misconduct, the
  large number of victims, the significant amount of funds involved, the apparent lack of respect for the authority of
  the Court evidenced by the unauthorized practice of law, and the criminal conviction," the board concluded that
  nothing less than permanent disbarment is warranted in this case.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In light of the joint stipulation between respondent and the ODC, the allegations of the formal
  charges were proven by clear and convincing evidence. Accordingly, the only issue presented for our determination is
  the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct. In considering that issue, we are mindful that disciplinary
  proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the
  profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis,
  <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent has stipulated to his criminal conviction for theft and the fact that he engaged in
  the unauthorized practice of law while he was suspended and while he was on disability inactive status, as well as
  other serious misconduct including neglect of legal matters, failure to communicate with his clients, commingling and
  conversion of client and third-party funds, and failure to cooperate with the ODC. The baseline sanction for this
  egregious misconduct is unquestionably disbarment. However, the disciplinary board urges us to go further and
  consider permanently prohibiting respondent from seeking readmission to the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In Appendix E to Supreme Court Rule XIX, we set forth guidelines illustrating the types of
  conduct which might warrant permanent disbarment. While these guidelines are not intended to bind this court in its
  decision-making process, they present useful information concerning the types of conduct we might consider worthy of
  permanent disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Applying those guidelines to the instant case, we find respondent's conversion of client and
  third-party funds falls within the scope of <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 1</span>, which applies to "Repeated
  or multiple instances of intentional conversion of client funds with substantial harm." Likewise, we find his
  decision to engage in the unauthorized practice of law following his 1997 suspension implicates
  <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 8</span> ("Following notice, engaging in the unauthorized practice of law . . .
  during the period of time in which the lawyer is suspended from the practice of law or disbarred"). While some
  mitigating factors are present, they pale in comparison to the seriousness of respondent's misconduct and the harm
  that he has visited upon his clients, the public, and the legal profession.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board's recommendation and impose permanent
  disbarment.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that the name of Paul Joseph Yaeger, Louisiana Bar Roll number 1656, be
  stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked. 
  Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered that respondent be permanently prohibited from
  being readmitted to the practice of law in this state. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against
  respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the
  date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> Specifically, in connection with the
  first count, respondent obtained a line of credit from  a finance company that was secured by his pending personal
  injury cases, but when those cases settled, he failed to remit the appropriate funds to the finance company to repay
  the debt. In connection with the second and third counts, respondent failed to remit settlements to two clients. In
  May 2000, respondent was sentenced to five years in prison at hard labor, suspended, and five years active probation,
  and was ordered to pay restitution to his victims.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">2</a> The committee found the following
  mitigating circumstances: personal and emotional  problems, mental impairment, timely good faith effort to make
  restitution and to rectify the consequences of the misconduct, full and free disclosure to the ODC and a cooperative
  attitude toward the proceedings, delay in the disciplinary proceedings, imposition of other penalties or sanctions,
  and remorse. The committee made no finding concerning aggravating factors.</p>
