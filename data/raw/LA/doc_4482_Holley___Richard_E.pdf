<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 01-B-1876</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: RICHARD E. HOLLEY</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p><b>PER CURIAM<a href="#fn_">*</a> </b> </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary mattertice law in Louisiana. stems from 
three counts of formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel 
(“ODC”) against respondent, Richard E. Holley, an attorney licensed to practice 
law in Louisiana.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<h3>Tridico Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">On March 14, 1998, Anthony Tridico, III, paid respondent $800 to represent 
him in connection with a divorce proceeding. Respondent failed to render the 
necessary services and failed to refund his client’s money. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On September 13, 1999, Mr. Tridico filed a complaint with the ODC. The ODC 
forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent. However, he failed to respond 
to the ODC’s requests for information during its investigation of the complaint.
</p>
<h3>Blanchard Matter </h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">On July 10, 1994, Barry Blanchard retained respondent to represent him in a 
divorce proceeding. Although the trial court rendered a divorce, respondent 
failed to obtain a signed judgment in the matter. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On October 28, 1998, Mr. Blanchard forwarded a disciplinary complaint to the 
ODC. Although respondent received a copy of the complaint from the ODC, he 
failed to answer the complaint. As a result, the ODC was forced to issue a 
subpoena to him.</p>
<h3>Kent Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">On September 16, 1998, Connie Kent retained respondent for $750 to represent 
her in a divorce proceeding. Respondent filed the pleadings, but failed to 
appear for a scheduled hearing. Subsequently, Ms. Kent discharged respondent and 
engaged new counsel to complete the matter.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On February 1, 1999, Ms. Kent filed a disciplinary complaint with the ODC. 
Although respondent received notices of the complaint on February 10, 1999 and 
March 3, 1999, he failed to reply. Subsequently, a subpoena was issued 
compelling his attendance at a scheduled deposition, but he failed to appear. 
However, respondent submitted a written response acknowledging he neglected the 
matter and failed to keep his client informed. </p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed three counts of formal charges against respondent based on the 
Tridico, Blanchard and Kent matters. The charges asserted violations of the 
following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- ID:RULE1.3 --">1.3</a></span> (lack of 
diligence), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- ID:RULE1.4 --">1.4</a></span> (failure to communicate), 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- ID:RULE1.5 --">1.5</a></span>(f)(6) (failure to refund unearned 
fees), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- ID:RULE8.1 --">8.1</a></span>(c) (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) and
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- ID:RULE8.4 --">8.4</a></span>(g) (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation). </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an answer to the formal charges, admitting some of the 
charges. With regard to the Tridico matter, he contended he never intentionally 
misled his client, and honestly believed that pleadings had been prepared and 
filed. He acknowledged his debt to Mr. Tridico and agreed to make restitution. 
He denied all allegations in the Blanchard matter, contending he successfully 
represented Mr. Blanchard, and that any responsibility for preparing a judgment 
had been given to the opposing counsel. Finally, he admitted the allegations in 
the Kent matter, and asserted he made restitution.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The matter was set for formal hearing. However, two days before the hearing 
date, respondent filed a letter in which he admitted to the misconduct as 
outline in the formal charges. He requested that the hearing be held for the 
sole purpose of allowing him to admit mitigating evidence, and for the committee 
to determine an appropriate sanction. </p>
<h3>Formal Hearing</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In mitigation, respondent claimed there was no intent on his part to neglect 
his clients’ matters. Respondent alleged that at the time of the misconduct, he 
had just started practicing law by himself and that he was overwhelmed with the 
day to day logistics in running a law office. He conceded that he failed to 
establish efficient office procedures and lacked a full-time office support 
staff and a reliable calendaring system. Respondent testified he implemented a 
new calendaring system that will likely bar the occurrence of future problems. 
As to restitution, respondent contended he provided full restitution to Ms. 
Kent, but still owed $800 to Mr. Tridico. </p>
<h3><a href="#!-- ID:00-DB-035.HC --">Recommendation of the Hearing Committee</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on respondent’s admissions, the committee determined there was clear 
and convincing evidence to support the formal charges. Relying on Standards 
4.42, 4.43 and 7.3 of the ABA’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions,<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> the 
committee found the baseline sanction for his misconduct conduct was suspension. 
As to aggravating factors, it recognized respondent’s prior disciplinary 
infraction,<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> multiple offenses and substantial experience in the practice of law 
(admitted in 1982). In mitigation, it recognized, absence of a dishonest or 
selfish motive, payment of restitution, remorse, remoteness and dissimilarity of 
prior disciplinary offense and, after initial reluctance, full and free 
disclosure to disciplinary board and a cooperative attitude. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on these factors, the committee recommended that respondent be 
suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months, fully deferred, 
subject to a one year probation. It further proposed that respondent be required 
to attend the Practice Assistance School sponsored by the Louisiana State Bar 
Association and one seminar or workshop sponsored by the Office of Loss 
Prevention on law office management, as well as provide proof of restitution to 
Mr. Tridico and Ms. Kent.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- ID:00-DB-035.BD --">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board concurred with the committee that the record supported 
the findings that respondent violated Rules 1.3 (lack of diligence), 1.4 
(failure to communicate), 1.5(f)(6) (failure to refund unearned fees), 8.1(c) 
(failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) and 8.4(g) (failure to 
cooperate with the ODC in its investigation). The board found respondent 
knowingly and negligently violated duties owed to his clients and to the 
profession. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Relying on the ABA Standards and aggravating and mitigating factors cited by 
the committee, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the 
practice of law for a period of six months, with all but sixty days deferred, 
subject to a one year period of probation and the conditions cited by the 
committee.<br>
Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board’s 
recommendation. </p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">In light of respondent’s admission of misconduct, the sole issue presented 
for our consideration is the appropriate sanction under the facts. In 
determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary 
proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the 
public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. 
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i>, 
<a href="#!-- ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to 
be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the 
offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>, 
<a href="#!-- ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 
1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">A review of the record indicates respondent’s misconduct was more negligent 
than intentional. Nonetheless, his actions delayed resolution of his clients’ 
cases.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Aggravating factors are present, including respondent’s substantial experience 
in the practice of law and his prior disciplinary record. However, we recognize 
the presence of several significant mitigating factors, such as respondent’s 
lack of a dishonest and selfish motive, and his payment of restitution. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, we find a six-month suspension, with three months 
deferred, followed by a one year period of probation as recommended by the 
disciplinary board, to be appropriate under the facts. Accordingly, we will 
accept the recommendation of the disciplinary board.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and 
disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is the decision of this court 
that the recommendation of the disciplinary board be accepted. Accordingly, it 
is ordered that Richard E. Holley be suspended from the practice of law for a 
period of six months, with three months deferred, followed by a one year period 
of probation, subject to the conditions set forth in the disciplinary board’s 
recommendation. Respondent is further ordered to make restitution to his 
clients, and provide proof of restitution to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. 
All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in 
accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence 
thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s judgment until paid.</p>
