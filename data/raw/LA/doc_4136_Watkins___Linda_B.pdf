<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lorraine Jones retained Respondent to represent her in an appeal pending before the Social Security Administration (hereafter, the &quot;Administration&quot;).</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During her representation of Ms. Jones, on November 4 and November 22, 1988, Respondent filed physicians's reports into evidence, knowing that they had been falsely altered.&nbsp; Specifically, the alterations pertained to the severity of Ms. Jones's injuries, as well as her prognosis and dates of treatment.&nbsp; The altered information was material to the determination of Ms. Jones's rights to receive Social Security Income benefits and, therefore, in violation of </font><span class="CITE">42 U.S.C. Section 1383a(a)(2).</span></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondent was also retained by William Benton to represent him in a Supplemental Security Income disability appeal hearing.&nbsp; In accordance with federal law, Respondent had filed a petition with the Administration requesting that the Secretary of Health and Human Services approve an attorney's fee in the amount of $3,000 for services Respondent rendered to Mr. Benton.&nbsp; The Administration approved the fee and, on July 23, 1990, Respondent received payment in the amount of $3,000 from the Administration.&nbsp; The funds were withheld from Mr. Benton's benefits.&nbsp; However, Respondent had already collected her fee in the amount of $3,000 directly from Mr. Benton on October 27, 1989, approximately nine months earlier.&nbsp; Respondent failed to refund Mr. Benton's payment or to notify the Administration of the situation.&nbsp; Respondent's knowing assessment and collection of the unapproved and excessive fee constituted a violation of</font><font size="3" color="#008000"> 42 U.S.C. Section 406(a)(5).</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On March 9, 1993, Respondent entered a guilty plea in United States District Court, Middle District of Louisiana, to making false statements of fact to obtain Social Security Income benefits and to collecting excessive fees in representing Social Security claimants, in violation of</font><font size="3" color="#008000"> 42 U.S.C. Sections 1383a(a)(2) and 406(a)(5),</font><font size="3" color="#000000"> respectively.&nbsp; Respondent was sentenced on both counts to serve three years probation with special conditions, including serving six months in a halfway house and paying restitution.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On September 30, 1993, formal charges were filed against Respondent alleging violations of</font><font size="3" color="#800000"> </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE3.3'></a>(a)(1), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE3.4'></a>(a)(b), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a>(b)(c)&amp;(d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp; Specifically, Respondent was charged with making false statements of fact to a tribunal, unlawful altering of evidentiary documents, falsification of evidence, commission of criminal acts which adversely reflected upon her moral fitness to practice law, engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation, and engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.&nbsp; Respondent answered the formal charges. maintaining her federal convictions were only misdemeanors and, thus, not &quot;serious crimes&quot; warranting disbarment pursuant to</font><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp; Moreover, Respondent alleged there were substantial mitigating circumstances existing to warrant discipline less severe than disbarment.</font><p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On January 1, 1994, the formal charges were heard by the Hearing Committee.&nbsp; Prior to the hearing, Respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel entered into an agreement and submitted a joint stipulation as to the admissibility of various documents relating to respondent's criminal conviction, her mental health, and her character.&nbsp; Furthermore, the parties stipulated that the appropriate sanction would be a suspension of one year and one day.&nbsp; Respondent was present at the hearing and testified on her own behalf.&nbsp; Upon review of the evidence and arguments, the <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Ae261?an=JD_HC9344 --##'>Hearing Committee issued its findings and recommendation </a>to the Disciplinary Board in accordance with </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s11'></a><font size="3">.&nbsp; It concluded several aggravating factors were present: dishonest and selfish motive, pattern of misconduct,</font><font size="3" color="#008000"> 2</font><font size="3" color="#000000"> multiple offenses, </font><font size="3">vulernability of victims, and substantial experience in the law.&nbsp; See, </font><font size="3"><u>American Bar</u></font><font size="3"> </font><font size="3"><u>Association's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</u></font><font size="3">, Standard 9.22 (b)(c)(d)(h)&amp;(i).&nbsp; In addition, the Committee observed the evidence established that Respondent's misconduct caused both actual injury to Mr. Benton and potential injury to Ms. Jones and the Administration.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Committee considered the Respondent's personal and emotional problems, </font><font size="3" color="#008000">3</font><font size="3" color="#000000"> timely restitution, cooperation with disciplinary authority, good character and reputation in the community, and the imposed criminal sentence as mitigating factors.&nbsp; Id., Standard 9.32(c)(d)(e)(g)&amp;(k). The Hearing Committee recommended to the Disciplinary Board adoption of the consent discipline of a suspension for a period of one year and one day, as well as an assessment of all costs of the disciplinary proceedings.&nbsp; The Committee further recommended the following conditions to be fulfilled by Respondent in the event she should seek reinstatement to the practice of law:</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Recognition of Respondent's physical, mental and/or emotional problems as a disability affecting her competency to practice, removal or sufficient amelioration of which must be demonstrated prior to reinstatement;</font></p>

(See</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#008000"> In re: Linda B. Watkins, 95-130459 (La. 6/16/95), n.2.)</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When a lawyer engages in serious misconduct as displayed by this respondent, the baseline sanction is disbarment.&nbsp; Despite this, the Disciplinary Board, relying on</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#008000"> LSBA v. White, 539 So.2d 1216 (La. 1989</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">), recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for two years. (See ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, Standard 5.1 1, Failure to Maintain Personal Integrity; Standard 6.1 1, False Statements, Fraud, and Misrepresentation; and 4.11 and 4.12, Failure to Preserve the Client's Property.) Respondent's multiple offenses, coupled with a pattern of misconduct warrants a more severe sanction.&nbsp; Ironically, respondent will be reinstated to practice law in this state while still serving her probationary sentence.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Recently, in</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#008000"> In re: James F. Quaid, 94-13-1316 (La. 11/30/94), 646 So.2d 343, rehearing denied (La. 2/16/95),</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"> this Court disbarred an attorney for collecting a $9,145.47 fee in a Social</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Security proceeding, which was $6,645.47 more than the $2,500.00 approved by the Social Security Administration.&nbsp; The Court concluded that respondent knowingly presented false or misleading information to the tribunal regarding the fee charged to his client.&nbsp; Additional aggravating factors were Quaid's prior reprimands by this Court.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Notwithstanding that each case presented before this tribunal must be considered based upon its own distinct set of facts and circumstances, the aggravating factors, as well as the mitigating factors involved, this Court must be consistent when imposing disciplinary sanctions upon respondents whose misconduct is similar in nature.&nbsp; Since the respondent's misconduct in</font><span class="CITE"> <font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><u>In re: James F. Quaid</u></font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> is similar in nature to the misconduct exhibited by Linda Watkins, there should not be a wide disparity in the sanctions imposed.</font></p>
<p class='footnotetitle'>FOOTNOTES:</p>
<p class='footnote'>2 The Pre-Sentence investigative Report adopted by the federal district judge presiding in the criminal case discussed five other instances of &quot;uncharged behavior&quot; wherein Respondent had received fee payments from Social Security Income recipients prior to approval from the Administration as required by federal law, and falsely indicated in her petitions for fee approval that she had not received any prior payments.&nbsp; The last of these instances occurred only six days</p>
<p><font size="3" color="#008000">before Respondent entered her guilty plea in federal court.</font><font size="3" color="#008000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class='footnote'>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Respondent submitted substantial medical documentation to support the existence of her personal and emotional problems; however, the Committee did not give significant weight to these problems as mitigating factors.&nbsp; The Committee observed that for a mental condition to be a mitigating factor, there must be a direct causation between the mental disability and the misconduct giving rise to the disciplinary charge.&nbsp; The Committee stated the record lacked evidence as to how Respondent's mental condition resulted in the commission of her crimes which required knowing and affirmative acts.</p>
<p class='footnote'><font size="3" color="#008000"> </font><font size="1">4</font><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font>There were two members of the Disciplinary Board who dissented from the Board's recommendation of a two year suspension.&nbsp; One member stated the fraudulent nature of the Respondent's actions warranted disbarment.&nbsp; See, <u>American Bar Association's Standard for</u> <u>ImRosing LgMer Sanctions</u>, Standards 5.11 and 6.11. The other dissenting member recommended a one year and one day suspension based on the stipulation between Disciplinary Counsel and Respondent, the mitigating factors addressed by the Committee, and the suggested conditions for reinstatement and practice.</p>
