  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: FRANKLIN W. HALL</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">AND DALE L. SIBLEY</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from three counts of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondents, Franklin W. Hall and Dale L. Sibley, attorneys licensed to practice
  law in Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The underlying facts of these matters are not in dispute, having been stipulated to by the
  parties.</p>

  <h3>Counts I and II</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In the latter part of 1999, respondents practiced law in a three-lawyer partnership.  During this
  time, respondents hired Martha Minnieweather to work as a secretary/paralegal, knowing that Ms. Minnieweather was a
  disbarred lawyer.<a name="_ftnref1" title="" href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> While Ms. Minnieweather was employed
  by respondents, she falsely told clients that she was a lawyer, conducted client interviews without supervision, and
  received and misappropriated client funds. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In Count I, the Whorton matter, Ms. Minnieweather accepted $870 from Ora Lee Whorton in
  connection with a legal matter.  However, Ms. Minnieweather failed to advise respondents- firm of the payment and
  misappropriated the funds to her own use.  While respondents had no personal knowledge of Ms. Minnieweather's
  activities, they admit they had no meaningful procedures in place that would have uncovered and/or prevented these
  improprieties.  Respondents acknowledge that their conduct violated Rule <span class="allegedrules">5.3</span>
  (responsibilities regarding non-lawyer assistants) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  In addition, respondent
  Hall acknowledges that his conduct in the Whorton matter violated Rule <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure
  to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In Count II, the Minnieweather matter, Ms. Minnieweather's brother, James Minnieweather, retained
  respondents to handle the succession of Dorothy Minnieweather.  Mr. Minnieweather paid respondents a $3,500 fee in
  January 2000, but no succession was ever opened.  In April 2000, Mr. Minnieweather discharged respondents and
  demanded the file and a return of the legal fee he paid.  Respondents did not refund the fee until October 2001, long
  after Mr. Minnieweather filed a complaint with the ODC in September 2000.  Respondents acknowledge that their conduct
  in the Minnieweather matter violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.5(f)(6)</span> (failure to refund an unearned
  fee) and <span class="allegedrules">1.16</span> (obligations upon termination of the representation) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count III</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In February 1999, Flenard Autrey, Sr. retained respondents to file an application for post
  conviction relief on behalf of his son, Flenard Autrey, Jr., who in 1997 had pleaded guilty to manslaughter in Caddo
  Parish.  Respondents were paid $2,500 to review the records of Mr. Autrey, Jr.'s criminal proceedings, and were paid
  an additional $2,100 towards their quoted fee of $25,000 for filing the application for post conviction relief. 
  Respondents performed some work in the matter, but they did not enroll as Mr. Autrey, Jr.'s counsel, nor did they
  file an application for post conviction relief on his behalf.  In February 2000, Mr. Autrey discharged respondents,
  citing a lack of progress on the appeal.  However, respondents delayed in refunding the unearned portion of the legal
  fee paid on Mr. Autrey, Jr.'s behalf.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondents acknowledge that their conduct in the Autrey matter violated Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.1(a)</span> (failure to provide competent representation to a client) and 1.5(f)(6) of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">This matter proceeded to a formal hearing on December 9, 2002.  In light of the stipulated facts
  and rule violations, the only issue remaining for the hearing committee's consideration was the appropriate sanction
  for the respondents- misconduct.  During the hearing, respondents acknowledged that they "made some mistakes in how
  we handled these problems that arose within our firm," but they contended these were "mistakes of ignorance" and were
  unintentional.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2003-03-24_02-DB-047.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The committee acknowledged respondents- assertion that they made mistakes in ignorance, but noted
  that respondent Sibley has been a practicing attorney since 1987 and respondent Hall has been a practicing attorney
  since 1993.  In light of this fact, the committee felt it was difficult to fully attribute the admitted mistakes to
  simple inexperience.  In addition, the committee noted it was troubled by respondents- failure to refund $2,100 to
  Mr. Autrey, which respondents admitted was unearned.  Under all the circumstances, the committee recommended that
  respondents be suspended from the practice of law for a period of ninety days, with the suspension to be deferred "if
  and only if the $2,100.00 owed in the Autrey matter is refunded within thirty (30) days of the final decision in this
  matter."<a name="_ftnref2" title="" href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Neither respondents nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's
  recommendation. </p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-01-23_02-DB-047.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board determined that respondents- actions were partly negligent and partly
  knowing.  In Counts I and II, respondents negligently failed to properly supervise a non-lawyer employee.  In Count
  III, respondents knowingly failed to promptly refund unearned fees paid on Mr. Autrey's behalf.  These actions
  resulted primarily in respondents- violation of duties owed to their clients, who have suffered actual injury in the
  delay of their legal matters and by the deprivation of funds rightly due them.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the board recognized multiple offenses and substantial experience in the
  practice of law.  In mitigation, the board recognized that neither respondent has a prior disciplinary record, as
  well as respondents- full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board, cooperative attitude toward the proceedings,
  and remorse.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.12</span> of the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer
  Sanctions</i> provides that suspension is appropriate when a lawyer knows or should know that he is dealing
  improperly with client property and causes injury or potential injury to a client.  In Count III, the Autrey matter,
  respondents have failed to promptly provide an accounting or to return any unearned fee.  Their actions deprived Mr.
  Autrey, Jr.'s family (who paid the fee on Mr. Autrey, Jr.'s behalf) of funds rightfully due them for a significant
  period of time.  Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span> provides for a reprimand when a lawyer is negligent
  and does not act with reasonable diligence in representing a client, and causes injury or potential injury to a
  client.  The failure of respondents to ensure that Ms. Minnieweather was properly supervised led to a lack of
  diligence in the handling of their clients- legal matters.  As a result, their clients- legal matters were unduly
  delayed and jeopardized.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on the ABA Standards and the case law, the board determined that either a reprimand or a
  deferred suspension is the appropriate sanction for respondents- misconduct.  Primarily considering respondents-
  delay in refunding the unearned fee in the Autrey matter, the board concluded that a short suspension is warranted. 
  However, given respondents- cooperation in this matter, the board felt it is appropriate to fully defer the
  suspension.  Accordingly, the board recommended that respondents be suspended from the practice of law for a period
  of ninety days, deferred, with any misconduct occurring during a one-year period following the finality of the
  court's order being grounds for making the deferred period of suspension executory.  The board also recommended that
  respondents be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running
  thirty days from the date of finality of the court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Neither respondents nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's
  recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">In light of respondents- stipulation to the underlying facts and rule violations, the sole issue
  presented for our consideration in this case is the appropriate sanction for respondents- misconduct.  In considering
  that issue, we are mindful that the purpose of lawyer disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer,
  but rather to maintain appropriate standards of professional conduct to safeguard the public, to preserve the
  integrity of the legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the standards of the
  profession.  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass-n v. Guidry</i>, <a href="1990-12-03_1988-0829.htm">571
  So. 2d 161</a> (La. 1990)</span>.  The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the
  seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. 
  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass-n v. Whittington</i>, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d
  520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The rule violations in this case, as admitted by respondents, principally involve their failure
  to supervise Ms. Minnieweather, their non-lawyer assistant, and their failure to promptly refund unearned legal
  fees.  Their failure to supervise Ms. Minnieweather appears to be the result of negligence, as there is no evidence
  in the record that respondents were aware Ms.  Minnieweather, a disbarred attorney, was holding herself out as an
  attorney licensed to practice law.<a name="_ftnref3" title="" href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Respondents-
  failure to refund unearned fees to their clients was knowing and caused actual harm to these clients.  However,
  respondents ultimately made full restitution of all unearned fees.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In cases principally involving a failure to account for and return unearned fees to one client,
  this court has generally imposed sanctions ranging from public reprimand to suspension.  <i>See, e.g.,</i>
  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Slaughter</i>, 01-0151 (La. 2/16/01),
  <a href="2001-02-16_2001-0151.htm">778 So. 2d 1138</a></span> (attorney with a prior disciplinary record suspended
  for six months, fully deferred, subject to a one-year period of probation, for failing to refund an unearned fee and
  failing to keep an accurate accounting of the client's fee payments); <span class="cite"><i>In re: Colwart</i>,
  98-2303 (La. 11/6/98), <a href="1998-11-16_1998-2303.htm">721 So. 2d 848</a></span> (attorney suspended for six
  months for neglect of a legal matter, failure to communicate with a client, failure to return an unearned fee, and
  failure to cooperate with ODC; several aggravating factors present); <span class="cite"><i>In re: Johnson</i>,
  97-0879, 97-0880 (La. 9/26/97), <a href="1997-09-26_1997-0879.htm">700 So. 2d 1260</a></span> (attorney with a prior
  disciplinary record suspended for one year, with six months deferred, followed by two years of probation for failure
  to refund advanced expenses to a client and failing to cooperate with the ODC); <span class="cite"><i>In re:
  Guidry</i>, 94-1923 (La. 10/28/94), <a href="1994-10-28_1994-1923.htm">645 So. 2d 625</a></span> (attorney with no
  prior disciplinary record was suspended from practice for three months for neglect of a legal matter, failure to
  communicate with a client, and failure to account for or return unearned fee); and <span class="cite"><i>In re:
  Mouton</i>, <a href="1992-10-30_1991-2938.htm">610 So. 2d 787</a> (La.1992)</span> (attorney with no prior
  disciplinary record received a public reprimand for failing to return a total of $3,125 in unearned fees advanced by
  two clients). </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">There is not much jurisprudence addressing an attorney's failure to supervise non-attorney
  assistants.  However, in <span class="cite"><i>In re: Wilkinson</i>, 01-2310 (La. 1/15/02),
  <a href="2002-01-15_2001-2310.htm">805 So. 2d 142</a></span>, the court imposed a sixty-day suspension in a case in
  which an attorney knowingly turned over a succession matter to a law clerk for handling.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Considering this jurisprudence, we conclude the baseline sanction for respondents- misconduct,
  taken as a whole, is a short suspension from the practice of law, some or all of which may be deferred. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As aggravating factors, we find respondents have committed multiple offenses and have substantial
  experience in the practice of law. In mitigation, we place great emphasis on the fact that neither respondent has a
  prior disciplinary record.  Additionally, we recognize respondents have made full and free disclosure to the
  disciplinary board, demonstrated a cooperative attitude toward the proceedings, and have expressed sincere remorse
  for their actions. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Considering all the facts of the case, we conclude the appropriate sanction for respondents-
  misconduct is a ninety-day suspension from the practice of law.  However, in light of the mitigating factors, we will
  defer this suspension in its entirety, subject to the condition that any misconduct during a one-year period
  following the finality of this judgment may be grounds for making the deferred suspension executory, or imposing
  additional discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Franklin W. Hall, Louisiana Bar Roll number 22408, and Dale L. Sibley,
  Louisiana Bar Roll number 18433, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of ninety days.  It is further
  ordered that these suspensions shall be deferred in their entirety, subject to the condition that any misconduct by
  respondents during a one-year period following the date of finality of this court's judgment may be grounds for
  making the deferred suspensions executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate.  All costs and expenses
  in the matter are assessed against respondents in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest
  to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="fn1" id="fn1">[1]</a> Ms. Minnieweather was disbarred in 1994 for
  her conviction of two counts of misappropriation of bankruptcy estate property, one count of concealing the assets of
  a bankruptcy estate, and four counts of mail fraud.  She also commingled and converted client funds, neglected legal
  matters, and failed to communicate with her clients.  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Minnieweather</i>, 94-1782,
