  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that William C. Passman,
  Louisiana Bar Roll number 21797, be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of three years. 
  This suspension shall be retroactive to April 21, 2004, the date of respondent's interim suspension.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
