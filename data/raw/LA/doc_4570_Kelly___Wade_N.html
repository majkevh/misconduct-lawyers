<h2>PER CURIAM</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">This proceeding arises out of an application for reinstatement filed by 
petitioner, Wade N. Kelly, an attorney who is currently suspended from the 
practice of law in Louisiana.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">On June 5, 1998, this court suspended petitioner from practice for three 
years. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Kelly</i>, 98-0368 (La. 6/5/98), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:713%20So.2d%20458 --#">713 So. 2d 458</a></span>. The underlying 
disciplinary matter arose from petitioner’s diversion of more than $60,000 in 
legal fees from the law firm of which he was then a partner. After serving his 
suspension, petitioner filed an application for reinstatement, asserting that he 
has complied with the reinstatement criteria set forth in Supreme Court Rule 
XIX, § 24(E). The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) initially indicated 
that it would take no position concerning petitioner’s reinstatement to the 
practice of law, and accordingly, the matter was referred for a formal hearing 
before a hearing committee.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After considering the evidence presented, the hearing committee recommended 
that the petition for reinstatement be granted. The ODC objected to the 
recommendation solely insofar as no period of supervised probation followed 
petitioner’s reinstatement. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Thereafter, the disciplinary board recommended to this court that petitioner 
be reinstated to the practice of law. The board adopted the factual findings of 
the hearing committee, and agreed that petitioner proved by clear and convincing 
evidence that he satisfies the criteria for reinstatement. However, considering 
the circumstances, the board recommended that petitioner’s reinstatement be 
conditional, subject to a probationary period of eighteen months. During this 
period, the board recommended petitioner’s financial accounts, including any 
operating or trust accounts, be subject to monitoring on a quarterly basis at 
his expense. The board also recommended that petitioner be assessed with all 
costs and expenses of these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither petitioner nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board’s 
recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Petitioner has served the three-year suspension imposed by this court in 
1998, and no objections were received to his application for reinstatement. 
Petitioner has met the criteria for reinstatement set forth in Supreme Court 
Rule XIX, § 24(E). Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board’s 
recommendation and order that petitioner be conditionally reinstated to the 
practice of law in Louisiana, subject to a probationary period of eighteen 
months. During the period of probation, petitioner’s financial accounts, 
including any operating or client trust accounts, shall be monitored on at least 
a quarterly basis at his expense. Should petitioner fail to comply with the 
conditions of probation, or should he commit any misconduct during the period of 
probation, his conditional right to practice may be terminated or he may be 
subjected to other discipline pursuant to the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary 
Enforcement.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and 
disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that Wade N. Kelly 
be conditionally reinstated to the practice of law in Louisiana, subject to a 
probationary period of eighteen months. During this period, petitioner’s 
financial accounts, including any operating or client trust accounts, shall be 
subject to monitoring on at least a quarterly basis at his expense. Should 
petitioner fail to comply with the conditions of probation, or should he commit 
any misconduct during the period of probation, his conditional right to practice 
may be terminated or he may be subjected
to other discipline pursuant to the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement.</p>
