  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE:  DAVID L. WALLACE</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 00-DB-012</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a Joint Petition for Consent
  Discipline.  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (herein "ODC") filed formal charges against Respondent, David L.
  Wallace of Deridder, Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On July 13, 1998, ODC advised Respondent that a client had filed a complaint against him.  The
  client claimed that Respondent failed to communicate and to use diligence in representing her.  On July 31, 1998,
  Respondent replied by outlining the fee agreement, the steps taken in the litigation and the problems with the
  case.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On February 2, 2000, ODC filed formal charges against Respondent alleging one count of
  misconduct.  On March 8, 2000, Respondent, pro se, answered the charges with a general denial and outlined the
  progress of the case (a judgment had been rendered in favor of Complainant on February 24, 2000).  On May 1, 2000,
  Perry Sanders enrolled as counsel for Respondent.  On May 8, 2000, Respondent and ODC filed a Joint Petition for
  Consent Discipline seeking a public reprimand.  A panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter on June 29,
  2000.  At the hearing, James T. Daly represented ODC and Respondent did not appear.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The charges arise out of an elderly client's complaint that she had paid $2,500 to Respondent in
  1995 for representation regarding alleged damages to her real property. The client paid Respondent $2,500, which was
  to be a down payment on the total fee of $5,000.  Respondent never demanded or received payment of the additional
  $2,500.  Respondent filed suit and served the defendant in November 1995.  Defendant failed to answer and Respondent
  took a preliminary default.  The Respondent engaged a civil engineer to examine the drainage condition of Claimant's
  property.  The civil engineer rendered his report on September 23, 1996.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In July 1998, client filed her complaint with ODC against the Respondent.  On November 12, 1998,
  the civil engineer, who rendered the expert report, wrote a letter to the representative of the defendant, the Parish
  Police Jury, confirming an agreement reached during an October 30, 1998 meeting.  At the meeting, the civil engineer,
  the Complainant and defendant's representative met to discuss what the Parish could do "to correct the problem and to
  preclude future legal action".</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On September 3, 1999, Respondent answered Complainant's letter dated September 2, 1999. He
  acknowledged that the matter was taking too long to resolve and asked her to make an appointment with his office to
  discuss what witnesses to call.  On November 3, 1999, an appraiser, engaged by Respondent to appraise Complainant's
  real property, issued his property valuation.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On December 29, 1999, Complainant wrote another letter to ODC claiming that Respondent paid the
  appraiser $300 to "make a false report that - will clear him".</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On February 1, 2000, Respondent wrote to Complainant to advise that he was lining up the
  appraiser, civil engineer and witnesses to go to court on February 24, 2000, to resolve the case.  ODC filed formal
  charges on February 2, 2000.   On February 24, 2000, the court rendered judgment in favor of Complainant and her
  husband for $6,900 with legal interest from November 3, 1995, date of judicial demand, and awarded the payment of the
  civil engineer's and appraiser's expert fees.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">ODC asserts that Respondent failed to move the case forward, to keep his client informed and that
  he kept the $2,500 fee.  In the Joint Petition for Consent Discipline, Respondent agrees that he violated Rules of
  Professional Conduct <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span><a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" class="fn"
  id="_ednref1">[i]</a> and <span class="allegedrules">1.4(a)</span><a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn"
  id="_ednref2">[ii]</a>.</p>

  <h2>REQUEST FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE AND CONCURRENCE BY ODC</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">In the Petition for Consent Discipline, Respondent admits that he failed to timely move the case
  to conclusion and that he failed to clearly explain to Complainant the status of the case and the reasons for the
  delay.  Respondent admits that he violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span> and <span class="Rules">1.4(a)</span>
  of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  Respondent proposes that he be publicly reprimanded.  ODC concurs with the
  consent discipline and recommends same to the Board.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C), states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system or to the
    profession;</p>

    <p>(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly or negligently;</p>

    <p>(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p>(4)  the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Board finds that Respondent has violated the duty of reasonable diligence owed to his clients
  and that his negligent conduct was a source of potential injury to the clients.  The <u>A.B.A. Standards for Imposing
  Lawyer Sanction</u> (herein "Standard") Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span> provides for reprimand when "a
  lawyer is negligent and does not act with reasonable diligence in representing a client, and causes injury or
  potential injury to a client".  After lengthy delays, Respondent ultimately began to move the lawsuit to resolution.
  However, the clients' advanced years created the potential injury of denying them the satisfaction of resolving their
  claim during their lifetime.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In the case of <span class="cite"><u>In re Calvin J. Laiche</u>, No.
  <a href="1999-07-15_98-DB-057.htm">98-DB-057</a> (7/15/99)</span>, respondent and ODC filed a Joint Motion for
  Consent Discipline of a public reprimand for five counts involving failure to keep his clients informed; failure to
  diligently move the case along over eight years; failure to inform clients of a settlement offer, which he rejected;
  refusal to hand over the file and failure to execute a motion to substitute counsel for months after being discharged
  by his clients; and failure to respond to the disciplinary complaint. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Pursuant to the A.B.A. Standards, the Board finds the aggravating factors found in Rule 9.2(h)
  (<span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the victim</span>) and (i) (<span class="ABAstandard">substantial
  experience in the law</span>.) The Complainant and her husband are quite elderly and the Respondent has
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span> (licensed to practice in 1979).  The
  Board finds the mitigating factors of 9.32(a) (<span class="ABAstandard">the absence of a prior disciplinary
  record</span>), (d) (<span class="ABAstandard">timely good faith effort to make restitution</span>) and (e)
  (<span class="ABAstandard">cooperation with the disciplinary process</span>).  The Board finds the sanction of public
  reprimand, recommended by the parties, is in keeping with the A.B.A. Standards and case law. </p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Disciplinary Board therefore orders that Respondent, David L. Wallace, be, and is hereby
  issued a public reprimand and assessed all disciplinary costs associated with the disciplinary investigation and
  these disciplinary proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of the
  Ruling until paid.</p>
