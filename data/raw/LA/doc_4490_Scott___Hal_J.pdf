<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
This disciplinary proceeding arises from one count of formal charges filed by 
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Hal J. Scott, an 
attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana, but currently on interim 
suspension.</p>

<h2>
UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
In late 1980, James R. King, an employee of the Louisiana Department of 
Elections and Registration (“Department”), approached respondent to bid on 
drayage (trucking) contracts awarded by the Department to transport voting 
machines to and from voting sites. Although Mr. King was prohibited from bidding 
on such contracts as an employee of the Department,<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn1"><font size="1">1</font></a></span> he and respondent confected 
an arrangement whereby respondent would bid on the drayage contract with the 
Department in his own name, but all services under the contract would be 
performed by Mr. King, even though the contracts specifically prohibited 
assignment of the contract to any third party without the written permission of 
the Department. Respondent received payments for the contractual services, 
deposited the money in his client trust account, and wrote checks to Mr. King 
for the same amount. Respondent did not receive anything of value for his 
participation in the scheme.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
The arrangement between respondent and Mr. King continued from late 1980 until 
March 17, 1999, when the Louisiana Office of Legislative Auditor’s report on the 
Department was released and exposed the scheme.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn2"><font size="1">2</font></a></span> Three months later, on June 16, 
1999, respondent was arrested and charged with one count of conspiracy to file 
or maintain false public records, violations of La. R.S. 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.legis.state.la.us/tsrs/tsrs.asp?lawbody=RS&title=14&section=26">14:26</a> and 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.legis.state.la.us/tsrs/tsrs.asp?lawbody=RS&title=14&section=113">14:133</a>. On 
the same day, respondent pleaded guilty to the felony charge set out in the bill 
of information. He was subsequently sentenced to a deferred one-year sentence, 
subject to a period of active supervised probation with imposition of fines and 
restrictions.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn3"><font size="1">3</font></a></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
Shortly after his conviction and sentencing, respondent and the ODC filed a 
joint motion with this court seeking to place respondent on interim suspension. 
This court granted the motion and placed respondent on interim suspension.

re: Scott</i>, 99-2010 (La. 9/3/99), <a href="#!-- #ID:740%20So.2d%20103 --#">740 So. 2d 103</a></span>. </p>

<h2>
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

<h3>
Formal Charges</h3>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
After investigation, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against 
respondent, alleging that his conviction constituted the commission of a serious 
crime for purposes of Rule <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent 
subsequently answered the formal charges conceding he engaged in the misconduct, 
but asserted there were several applicable mitigating circumstances, including 
lack of financial benefit to him, lack of financial harm to the State of 
Louisiana, lack of selfish motive, cooperation and remorse. Respondent also 
pointed out the offense did not arise out of the practice of law and did not 
cause harm to any clients.</p>

<h3>
Formal Hearing</h3>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
At a formal hearing, the ODC called no witnesses, but introduced the record of 
respondent’s underlying criminal conviction, including the bill of information, 
the affidavit and audit report submitted by the legislative auditor in support 
of the arrest warrant, respondent’s guilty plea and the plea and cooperation 
agreement entered into between respondent and the district attorney’s office. 
Numerous other public officials and attorneys submitted written letters 
attesting to respondent’s character and competence. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
Respondent testified on his own behalf. He stated that he knew Mr. King had a 
contract with the Department to store the voting machines when they were not 
used, and that he believed Mr. King needed him to bid on the drayage contracts 
because Mr. King could not do both. He further testified former Commissioner of 
Elections Jerry Fowler and other Department officials were the ones who actually 
suggested the illegal bidding scheme. Respondent stated that when he agreed to 
participate in the scheme to assist his friend, he had a feeling it was illegal. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
Therefore, he discussed the matter with Commissioner Fowler, who advised 
respondent not to worry because that was the way things were being done around 
the state.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn4"><font size="1">4</font></a></span> </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
As to his active participation in the scheme, respondent testified Mr. King 
would personally deliver blank bid sheets for respondent’s signature on a 
periodic basis and Mr. King would subsequently fill them out and submit them for 
consideration. Respondent stated the Department employees involved in the 
bidding process were aware that respondent’s name was being used by Mr. King 
because they always dealt with Mr. King regarding the details of respondent’s 
drayage contracts. Respondent claimed that, to the best of his knowledge, Mr. 
King was always awarded the bid contracts in their twenty-year relationship, and 
thus implied there was some bid rigging taking place within the Department. 
Respondent admitted that he funneled the money through his client trust account. 
However, he stated he had not practiced law since 1979 because he had to run his 
family’s 2,000 acre farm. Respondent maintained placing the funds in his client 
trust account was the easiest way to keep Mr. King’s funds segregated from his 
own. Respondent urged the court to consider a lenient sanction which would 
permit him to return to the practice of law. He stated that due to dire economic 
farming times, he had to sell his family’s farm, his two daughters’ homes, all 
of his immovable properties and farm equipment. </p>

<h3>
<a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-090.HC --#">Hearing Committee Recommendation </a></h3>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
The committee determined respondent violated Rule 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct 
involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation) of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn5"><font size="1">5</font></a></span> Relying on the ABA’s 
<i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer 
Sanctions</i>, it concluded the baseline sanction was disbarment. However, it 
recognized this court has departed downward from disbarment when there is 
appropriate mitigating evidence. In support, it cited jurisprudence where this 
court imposed thirty to thirty-six month suspensions for conduct constituting a 
“serious crime,” after considering mitigating factors related to the attorney’s 
cooperation with law enforcement authorities and willingness to plead guilty to 
the criminal offenses.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn6"><font size="1">6</font></a></span> The committee concluded respondent violated a duty to 
the legal system and profession, resulting in great injury to the public and 
legal profession. It further noted:</p>
<blockquote>

<p align="justify">
Respondent knowingly and intentionally compromised his oath to the legal 
profession and allowed himself to be a facilitator in conspiring to circumvent 
State laws. Issues of trustworthiness and honesty are day to day concerns which 
must be strictly adhered to by attorneys in order to safeguard the integrity of 
the legal profession. Respondent’s conduct injures the public in that it has 
irrevocably shaken the public’s confidence in the State’s election process and 
its officials. </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
As mitigating factors, the committee recognized respondent’s remorse, 
cooperation in the criminal proceedings, and good character and reputation. In 
aggravation, the committee considered the fact the misconduct continued for 
nineteen years.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
Based on these factors, the committee concluded respondent’s misconduct 
warranted a thirty-six month suspension from the practice of law, retroactive to 
the date of his interim suspension.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee’s 
recommendation.</p>

<h3>
<a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-090.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
The disciplinary board concurred in the factual findings of the committee.<span style="vertical-align: super"><font size="1"><a href="#fn7">7</a></font></span> It 
found respondent knowingly and intentionally violated a duty owed to the public 
and as a professional, resulting in substantial injury to the public and legal 
profession.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn8"><font size="1">8</font></a></span> The board recognized several mitigating factors: remorse, absence 
of prior discipline, full and free disclosure and cooperation, good reputation, 
imposition of other penalties and sanctions, and absence of selfish motive. In 
aggravation, the board cited pattern of misconduct, substantial experience in 
the practice of law, and multiple offenses. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
Relying on the jurisprudence cited by the committee, coupled with the numerous 
mitigating factors, the board recommended adoption of the proposed sanction of a 
thirty-six month suspension, retroactive to the date of respondent’s interim 
suspension.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the 
disciplinary board’s recommendation. However, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 
XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s11 --#">11</a>(G)(1)(a), the court, on its own motion, docketed the matter for 
briefing and argument.</p>

<h2>
DISCUSSION</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
It is well settled that when an attorney has been convicted of a crime, the sole 
issue to be decided in a subsequent disciplinary proceeding is whether the crime 
warrants discipline and, if so, the extent thereof. Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 
<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s19 --#">19</a>(E). While the court may consider the circumstances of the offense, as well as 
any aggravating and mitigating circumstances, in determining the extent to which 
the crime warrants discipline, a respondent may not argue facts which are 
inconsistent with the essential elements of the crime of which he was convicted.
<span class="CITE"> 
<i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Wilkinson</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:562%20So.2d%20902 --#">562 So. 2d 902</a> (La. 1990)</span>. Simply put, a 
respondent cannot seek to try again the issue of guilt after he has been 
convicted. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. O’Halloran</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:412%20So.2d%20523 --#">412 So. 2d 523</a> (La. 1982)</span>. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
In the instant case, respondent was convicted of the crime of conspiracy to file 
or maintain false public records, in violation of La. R.S. 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.legis.state.la.us/tsrs/tsrs.asp?lawbody=RS&title=14&section=26">14:26</a> and 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.legis.state.la.us/tsrs/tsrs.asp?lawbody=RS&title=14&section=113">14:133</a>. The 
crime is a felony under state law and is a serious crime that involves fraud and 
misrepresentation. Respondent’s guilty plea is conclusive evidence of a 
violation of those statutes for the purpose of these disciplinary proceedings.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
In making a determination of the appropriate sanction, we are mindful that the 
purpose of lawyer disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the 
lawyer, but rather to maintain appropriate standards of professional conduct to 
safeguard the public, to preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and to 
deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the standards of the 
profession. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Guidry</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:571%20So.2d%20161 --#">571 So. 2d 161</a> (La. 1990)</span>. The 
discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness 
of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 
1984)</span>.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
As noted by the hearing committee, respondent’s actions have resulted in great 
injury to the legal profession and the public. While respondent’s misconduct 
does not involve the breach of any duties to clients, nor did it cause any 
specific damage to clients, his knowing participation for nearly twenty years in 
a fraudulent bidding scheme serves to undermine the public’s confidence in the 
legal profession.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
As aggravating factors, we recognize a pattern of misconduct, substantial 
experience in the practice of law (admitted 1972), and multiple offenses. 
However, the record reveals the existence of several significant mitigating 
factors, including respondent’s lack of a prior disciplinary record, his good 
character and reputation, his full and free disclosure to the legislative 
auditor’s office, district attorney’s office and to the disciplinary 
authorities, imposition of other penalties and sanctions, and remorse. Under 
these circumstances, we conclude the sanction recommended by the disciplinary 
board is appropriate under the facts. Accordingly, we will suspend respondent 
from the practice of law for a period of thirty-six months, retroactive to the 
date of his interim suspension. </p>

<h2>
DECREE</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">
Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and 
disciplinary board, and considering the record, briefs and oral argument, it is 
ordered that Hal J. Scott be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for 
a period of thirty-six months, retroactive to September 3, 1999, the date of his 
interim suspension. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against 
respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 
<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s10.1 --#">10.1</a>, with legal 
interest to commence thirty days from the date of the finality of this court’s 
judgment until paid. <br>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1 </a>The record indicates that Mr. King was originally employed by the Department 
from 1964 to 1985. He was rehired as a part-time warehouse mechanic, but 
apparently did not provide any services to the Department. Respondent later 
testified he was unaware Mr. King was on the Department’s employee payroll. He 
simply believed Mr. King was barred from participating in the drayage bidding 
because he also had a storage contract with the Department. In any event, 
respondent later learned, after a criminal investigation was instituted, that it 
was improper pursuant to the Department’s internal regulations for Mr. King to 
have any contract with the Department. </p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> The auditor’s report indicates that, from 1991 to 1998, the Department paid 
respondent $284,998 under the drayage contracts. It is unclear how much 
respondent received on behalf of Mr. King from the Department for the remaining 
years. Further, it notes Mr. King received $123,269 through the illegal scheme 
with respondent just from 1995 to 1998. The report states that although Mr. King 
participated in the contract before 1995 (i.e., 1980 to 1994), records were not 
provided to determine the amount he received.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> On August 22, 2000, after respondent successfully completed the terms of his

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> While Mr. King was friends with Commissioner Fowler, respondent was not. It 
was Mr. King who instigated the telephone discussions between respondent and 
Commissioner Fowler.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">5</a> The committee’s report states that Rule 8.4(b) (commission of a criminal act 
adversely reflecting on a lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a 
lawyer) is the alleged rule violated. Yet, it found a violation of Rule 8.4(c) 
(engaging in conduct involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation), 
and made no finding with regard to Rule 8.4(b). </p>

further injure and damage the confidence and faith by the people of this State 
in their elected officials.”<br>
