  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: J. BLAKE DESHOTELS</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, John Blake Deshotels, who is currently on interim suspension for threat of harm to the
  public.  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Deshotels</i>, 01-3219 (La. 12/12/01), 803 So. 2d 967</span>.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The formal charges, which were filed on January 7, 2002, consist of seventeen counts of
  misconduct, as follows:</p>

  <h3>Count I - The Marcantel &amp; Pierce Matters</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was retained to represent Steve Marcantel and James Pierce in connection with criminal
  matters.  In the Marcantel matter, respondent was ordered to file an appellate brief, but he failed to do so. 
  Subsequently, the Third Circuit Court of Appeal ordered respondent to show cause why he should not be held in
  contempt of court for failure to comply with an order of the court.  Similarly, respondent failed to file a brief in
  the Pierce matter, and once again, the Third Circuit ordered respondent to show cause why he should not be held in
  contempt of court.  Following a hearing on October 7, 1999, the Third Circuit found respondent in contempt of court
  with respect to both cases, and imposed a $500 fine, a 60-day jail sentence, suspended, and a two-year period of
  unsupervised probation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent's conduct constitutes a violation of the following provisions of
  the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with
  reasonable diligence and promptness in the representation of a client), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span>
  (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct
  prejudicial to the administration of justice).</p>

  <h3>Count II - The Godeaux Matter</h3>

  cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the complaint filed by Ms. Godeaux.</p>

  the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a

  <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation), 8.4(a),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or
  misrepresentation), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation).</p>

  <h3>Count III - The Pete Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Linda Pete retained respondent to represent her daughter in a personal injury matter.  Respondent

  <h3>Count IV - The Pierce Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In connection with the representation of James Pierce that is the subject of Count I, respondent
  failed to file an appeal on behalf of his client with this court, and refused to refund the unearned fee he was
  paid.  Respondent also failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the complaint filed by Mr.
  Pierce.</p>

  trust account representing Mr. Richard's portion of the settlement was returned for insufficient
  funds.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" class="fn" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a>  Respondent also failed to cooperate with the

  8.4(c), and 8.4(g).</p>

  <h3>Count IX - The Seale Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 2000, Mark Seale paid respondent $5,000 to handle various legal matters.  Respondent failed to
  communicate with Mr. Seale and refused to return his files so that Mr. Seale could retain other counsel.  Mr. Seale
  eventually filed suit against respondent in the 15th Judicial District Court seeking the return of his files.  The
  trial judge, Judge Marilyn Castle, ordered respondent to appear in court on September 10, 2001, but he failed to do
  so.  The matter was reset for November 12, 2001, but again respondent failed to appear.<a href="#_ftn5"
  name="_ftnref5" class="fn" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>  Judge Castle then ordered respondent arrested and held in the Ville
  Platte jail until he delivered Mr. Seale's files.  Mr. Seale did eventually receive his files, but many of his
  personal records were missing.  Respondent also failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the
  complaint filed by Mr. Seale.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent's conduct constitutes a violation of the following provisions of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.15(a), 1.16(d) (termination of the representation), 8.1(c),

  support and visitation matter.  Respondent failed to communicate with his clients and failed to file the appeal,
  leading Mr. and Mrs. Guillory to request the return of the fee they paid.  Respondent refused to refund the fee. 
  Thereafter, both respondent and his clients were ordered to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for
  failure to pay court costs.  Respondent failed to appear, and because Mr. and Mrs. Guillory could not pay the court
  costs themselves, the appeal was dismissed.  Respondent also failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of
  the complaint filed by Mr. and Mrs. Guillory.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent's conduct constitutes a violation of the following provisions of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 8.1(c), 8.4(a), 8.4(c), 8.4(d), and 8.4(g).</p>

  <h3>Count XI - The Paxton Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In January 1999, Michael Paxton retained respondent to represent him in a medical malpractice
  case.  In August 1999, respondent told Mr. Paxton that he had filed for a medical review panel, but thereafter, Mr.
  Paxton was unable to communicate with respondent.  Respondent apparently misrepresented the status of the matter to
  Mr. Paxton, as no evidence exists relating to a medical review panel proceeding on his behalf.  Mr. Paxton was unable

  imprisonment claim.  Respondent failed to communicate with Mr. Chaisson, neglected the matter, and failed to appear
  in court for hearings.  He also failed to return Mr. Chaisson's files, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation of the complaint filed by Mr. Chaisson.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent's conduct constitutes a violation of the following provisions of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(d), 8.1(c), 8.4(a), and 8.4(g).</p>

  <h3>Count XIII - The Allen Chaisson Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In July 2000, Allen Chaisson paid respondent $1,500 to handle a succession matter.  Respondent
  failed to communicate with Mr. Chaisson, neglected the matter, and failed to return Mr. Chaisson's files.  Respondent

  failed to communicate with Ms. Beauboeuf and put her case in jeopardy of being dismissed for his failure to respond
  to discovery.  Respondent was ordered by the trial court to file answers to discovery no later than January 19, 2001,
  but he failed to obey the court order.  Respondent also failed to appear for Ms. Beauboeuf's deposition, which was

  <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span>.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On January 10, 2002, respondent was personally served with the formal charges while incarcerated
  in the Evangeline Parish jail in Ville Platte.  He failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges. 
  Accordingly, the factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing
  evidence pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX,§ 11(E)(3).  No formal hearing was held, but the parties were given an
  opportunity to file with the hearing committee written arguments and documentary evidence on the issue of
  sanctions.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2002-09-23_02-DB-004.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Noting the factual allegations of the formal charges were deemed admitted and proven by clear and
  convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3), the hearing committee agreed that respondent
  violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged.  The committee found respondent violated duties owed to his
  clients, the public, the legal system, and the profession.  After consideration of the ODC's submission in response
  to the deemed admitted order,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" class="fn" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a> the committee
  concluded that respondent has engaged in persistent and widespread violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct,
  for which the baseline sanction is disbarment.  The committee recognized no mitigating factors, but determined the
  aggravating factors present include respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary
  record</span>,<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" class="fn" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a> <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest
  or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">multiple
  offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the victims</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in
  the practice of law</span> (admitted 1986), and <span class="ABAstandard">indifference to making restitution</span>. 
  Under these circumstances, the committee recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the hearing committee's
  recommendation.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" class="fn" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2003-07-23_02-DB-004.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board found that respondent's misconduct was knowing and intentional, and
  violated duties owed to his clients, the public, the legal system, and the profession.  Respondent's former clients
  were wrongfully deprived of funds to which they are entitled; for some, legal rights and remedies were unnecessarily
  delayed or jeopardized.  The legal system suffered actual harm by respondent's failure to comply with court orders
  and to diligently pursue his clients' legal matters.  The legal system also suffered actual harm by respondent's
  failure to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation.  An attorney's failure to cooperate delays the disciplinary
  process, unnecessarily diverts the limited resources of the disciplinary system, and impairs the system's ability to
  operate efficiently.  Finally, respondent violated his duty to the public by failing to maintain his personal
  integrity.  The board adopted the aggravating factors identified by the hearing committee, and agreed that the record
  does not support a finding of any mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Turning to the issue of an appropriate sanction, the board determined that disbarment is
  appropriate based upon the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> and the prior jurisprudence of this
  court dealing with similar misconduct.  Nevertheless, because respondent has demonstrated a complete lack of regard
  for the welfare of his clients and his professional obligations, the board recommended that he be permanently
  disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed a timely objection in this court to the recommendation of
  the disciplinary board.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The deemed admitted facts in this case establish that respondent has failed to communicate with
  his clients, neglected legal matters and allowed matters to prescribe, disobeyed court orders, failed to return
  clients' files, failed to protect clients' files, converted client funds, failed to provide accountings or to refund
  unearned fees, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation.  Therefore, the sole issue presented for
  our consideration is the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain
  high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future
  misconduct.  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So.
  2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.  The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness
  of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. 
  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d
  520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's conduct clearly violated duties owed to his clients, the public, the legal system,
  and the profession.  Unquestionably, the baseline sanction for such misconduct is disbarment.  Numerous aggravating
  factors are present, including prior disciplinary offenses, dishonest or selfish motive, a pattern of misconduct,
  multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature
  of the conduct, vulnerability of the victims, substantial experience in the practice of law, and indifference to
  making restitution.  We are unable to discern any mitigating factors from the record.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found disbarment is the appropriate sanction, the sole remaining issue presented for our
  consideration is whether respondent's conduct is so egregious that he should be permanently prohibited from seeking
  readmission to the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In Appendix E to Supreme Court Rule XIX, we set forth guidelines illustrating the types of
  conduct which might warrant permanent disbarment.  While these guidelines are not intended to bind this court in its
  decision-making process, they present useful information concerning the types of conduct we might consider worthy of
  permanent disbarment.  Guideline 1 applies to "repeated or multiple instances of intentional conversion of client
  funds with substantial harm."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The record reveals respondent deprived his clients of significant amounts of funds for a lengthy
  period of time, creating substantial harm.  Likewise, respondent's failure to account for and refund unearned fees
  paid by his clients resulted in a conversion of those funds to the detriment of his clients.  Therefore, we find
  respondent's conduct falls within the scope of this guideline.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">We do not lightly impose permanent disbarment.  Nonetheless, we are firmly convinced that we
  would be derelict in our constitutional duty to regulate the practice of law if we did not impose that sanction under
  the instant facts.  Respondent's actions demonstrate he lacks the requisite moral fitness to practice law in this
  state.  Respondent has disregarded and ignored his obligation to uphold the high standards of honesty and
  righteousness that he assumed when he took the oath as a member of the bar of this state. 
  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Haylon</i>, <a href="1967-05-01_48167.htm">250 La. 651, 198 So. 2d
  391, 392</a> (1967)</span>.  He has used his law license not to foster the high standards of the profession, but to
  exploit his clients for his own benefit.  This court cannot and will not tolerate such conduct.  Respondent's actions
  convincingly demonstrate he does not possess the requisite moral fitness to practice law in this state.  He must be
  permanently disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board's recommendation and impose permanent
  disbarment.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that the name of John Blake Deshotels, Louisiana Bar Roll number 17545, be
  stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked. 
  Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered that respondent be permanently prohibited from
  being readmitted to the practice of law in this state.  Respondent is ordered to make restitution to his victims and
  to repay to the Louisiana State Bar Association Client Assistance Fund any amounts paid to claimants on his behalf. 
  All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
  10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  re: Deshotels</i>, 98-1349, 98-1350 (La. 10/9/98), <a href="1998-10-09_1998-1349.htm">719 So. 2d 402</a></span>,
  respondent was suspended for six months, with all but sixty days deferred, followed by a two-year period of probation
  with conditions, for failure to properly terminate his representation of a client and for a pattern of criminal
  convictions (two DWI convictions and a disturbing the peace conviction).</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8" class="fn" id="_ftn8">[8]</a>  Six months after the hearing
  committee issued its recommendation, and one month after oral argument was heard in this matter by the disciplinary
  board, respondent sent a letter to the board and the ODC claiming an inability to respond to the formal charges and
  requesting that the record of these proceedings be reopened "for the purpose of providing evidence and argument." 
  However, respondent subsequently refused to reply to the ODC's correspondence concerning his request.  As a result,
  the disciplinary board denied the relief requested by respondent.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9" class="fn" id="_ftn9">[9]</a>  In support of its
  recommendation of discipline, the board relied upon Guidelines 1 (repeated instances of conversion of client funds
  with substantial harm) and 9 (serious attorney misconduct preceded by suspension or disbarment for prior instances of
  serious attorney misconduct) of the permanent disbarment guidelines.  However, respondent's 1998 suspension does not
  constitute "serious attorney misconduct."  That term is defined in the permanent disbarment guidelines as "any
  misconduct which results in a suspension of more than one year."  In his prior disciplinary matter, respondent was
  suspended for six months, with all but sixty days deferred.  Accordingly, Guideline 9 is inapplicable in this
  case.</p>
