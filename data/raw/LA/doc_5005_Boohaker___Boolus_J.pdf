  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: BOOLUS J. BOOHAKER</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that
  respondent commingled client funds with his own funds and failed to render an accounting to his client. After the
  filing of formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent discipline in which
  respondent admitted that his conduct violated Rule <span class="Rules">1.15</span> (safekeeping property of clients
  or third parties) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Having reviewed the petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Boolus J. Boohaker,
  Louisiana Bar Roll number 3233, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of eighteen months, with all but
  six months deferred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

    1332</span>. An attorney's actions of commingling and converting client funds violate the Rules of Professional
    Conduct 1.15 (safekeeping property of clients or third persons). In Re: Gros, 03-3076 (La. 4/23/04), 871 So.2d
    1091; In re Lewis, 03-1245 (La. 10/3/03), 856 So.2d 1191; In Re: Patrick, 01-1419 (La. 3/15/02), 815 so.2d 804;
    Louisiana State Bar Associateion v. Haylon, 198 So.2d 391 (La. 1967). This Court has determined that the
    sanctioning of an attorney "depends upon the seriousness of the offense, fashioned in the light of the purpose of
    the lawyer discipline, taking into account aggravating and mitigating circumstances." Louisiana State Bar
    Association v. O'Halloran, 412 So.2d 523 (La. 1982). This Court is mindful that the "disciplinary proceedings are
    designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and
    deter future misconduct." In Re: Bilbe, 02-1740 (La. 2/7/03) 841 So.2d 729.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">Disbarment is warranted, where: 1) an attorney acted in bad faith and contrary to the interest
    of his client, failed to inform his client of the status of litigation, settled a case without the knowledge of the
    client, negotiated settlements and converted his client's funds for own use; 2) his conduct caused client actual
    harm, depriving client and/or third party of their funds; 3) the record shows no restitution; 4) the aggravating
    factors were present; and 5) the mitigating factors were not significant enough to warrant deviation from the
    baseline sanction of disbarment. See, Rules of Professional Conduct 1.15, In Re: Carter, 02-2066(La. 10/14/02) 829
    So.2d 1023. In the case sub judice, Attorney Boohaker collected funds on behalf of his client, Mr. Fourgaut, yet
    the attorney failed to refund those funds to his client, failed to maintain proper records to account for those
    funds, and failed to properly deposit those funds in a separate account, i.e. trust account. In essence, he
    commingled $300,000.00 collected on behalf of his client and converted his client's funds for his personal use. His
    failure to properly handle his client's funds caused those funds to be lost through Attorney Boohaker's bankruptcy,
    which caused the client a substantial actual loss. This was not an isolated incident, as Attorney Boohaker has a
    prior disciplinary history which include a 1988 reprimand for a similar misconduct. These incidents include: 1) an
    admonition in 2000 for failing to communicate with a client and neglecting a legal matter and 2) a formal private
    reprimand in 1988 for failing to render a timely accounting and failing to promptly refund the unearned portion of
    legal fee paid in advance. These aggravating factors, coupled with his substantial experience in the practice of
    law which began in 1976, outweigh the stipulated mitigating factors of his cooperating with the disciplinary
    proceeding. As this Court held in Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Selenberg, 270 So.2d 848 (La. 1972), an attorney's
    misuse of a client's funds represents the "gravest form of professional misconduct" and disbarment is warranted.
    Therefore, I would reject the joint petition for consent discipline.</p>
