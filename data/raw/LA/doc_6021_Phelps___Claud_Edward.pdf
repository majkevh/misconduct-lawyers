  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 07-B-0286</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: CLAUD E. PHELPS, JR.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from two sets of formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Claud E. Phelps, Jr., an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana but currently suspended.</p>

  <h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Before we address the current charges, we find it helpful to review respondent's prior disciplinary history. Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in Louisiana in 1992. His first contact with the disciplinary system occurred in 1999, when he was admonished for neglect, failure to communicate with a client, failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation, and engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 2002, respondent filed a petition for consent discipline, in which he admitted to numerous instances of neglect, failure to expedite litigation, and failure to communicate with clients. We accepted the petition and suspended respondent from the practice of law for a period of one year and one day, but fully deferred the suspension subject to a twenty-four month period of supervised probation. In re: Phelps, 02-1837 (La. 9/30/02), 827 So. 2d 1140.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 2003, we determined respondent violated the conditions of his probation due to his failure to cooperate with his probation monitor. Accordingly, we made the previously deferred one-year-and-one-day suspension executory. In re: Phelps, 03- 2778 (La. 11/14/03), 860 So. 2d 531. Respondent has not sought reinstatement from this suspension. Accordingly, he remains suspended from the practice of law.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed two sets of formal charges against respondent, consisting of a total of twenty-seven counts of misconduct. The two sets of formal charges were considered by separate hearing committees but considered jointly by the disciplinary board,<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a> which then filed in this court a single recommendation of discipline encompassing both sets of formal charges.</p>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed formal charges against respondent. Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges. Accordingly, the factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). Thereafter, respondent requested that the deemed admitted order be recalled and he be allowed to answer the formal charges. The hearing committee chair granted this request. However, respondent again failed to file a timely answer to the formal charges, and the allegations were again deemed admitted.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">For a second time, respondent requested that the deemed admitted order be recalled and/or he be allowed to be heard in mitigation. The hearing committee chair denied the motion to recall the deemed admitted order but granted the motion for a mitigation hearing.

  <h3>Hearing Committee Recommendation</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After considering the testimony presented at the hearing, the ODC's submission, and the deemed admitted facts, the hearing committee found that the factual allegations as summarized in each count above were proven by clear and convincing evidence. Based on these facts, the committee determined that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee further determined that respondent violated duties owed to his clients, the public, and to the legal profession. The committee concluded he acted knowingly and caused harm to his clients in the form of delay, frustration, adverse or default judgments, and deprivation of funds by failing to refund unearned fees. It noted he accepted a total of at least $23,000 in fees from his clients, yet had not returned any fees to any of his clients or provided them with accountings. The committee also found he failed to take seriously the requests for information and subpoenas issued by the ODC. Relying upon the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the committee determined that disbarment is the baseline sanction. In aggravation, the committee recognized respondent's prior disciplinary offenses, a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, and indifference to making restitution. The committee found no mitigating factors to be present.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering respondent's history of similar misconduct, his clear pattern of misconduct, his apparent disregard for his duty to comply with disciplinary inquiries, the lack of mitigating factors, and this court's prior jurisprudence, the committee recommended that respondent be disbarred. The committee further recommended that respondent provide accountings to all of his clients, provide the appropriate restitution, and be charged with all costs and expenses of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3>Hearing Committee Recommendation</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After considering the ODC's submission and the deemed admitted facts, the hearing committee determined that the factual allegations as summarized in each count above were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence. Based on these facts, the committee determined that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.</p>

  <h2>03-DB-055 &amp; 05-DB-015</h2>

  <h3>Disciplinary Board Recommendation</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As noted earlier, the disciplinary board considered the hearing committee's recommendations in 03-DB-055 and 05-DB-015 together. After reviewing these matters, the disciplinary board determined that the deemed admitted facts are not manifestly erroneous. Based on these facts, the board determined that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board determined that respondent knowingly violated duties owed to his clients and to the legal profession. It found his misconduct caused his clients harm by delaying resolution of their legal matters. In addition, the board explained that respondent harmed his clients by failing to refund their unearned fees, and noted one client, Mr. Annina, had his wages garnished because of respondent's neglect. The board also found respondent repeatedly ignored the ODC's efforts to contact him. Relying upon the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the board determined that the baseline sanction is disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board found the following aggravating factors to be present: prior disciplinary offenses, a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted 1992), and indifference to making restitution. In mitigation, the board noted respondent's personal and emotional problems due to the death of his child in October 2003, although it observed this loss would not have affected respondent's conduct prior to October 2003.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering this court's prior jurisprudence and the numerous clients who have been harmed by respondent, the board recommended that respondent be disbarred. The board further recommended that respondent be ordered to provide accountings to his clients and refund any unearned fees. Finally, the board recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters fall within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V, § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. In re: Quaid, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), 646 So. 2d 343; Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall, 597 So. 2d 444 (La. 1992).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In cases in which the lawyer does not answer the formal charges, the factual allegations of those charges are deemed admitted. Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). Thus, the ODC bears no additional burden to prove the factual allegations contained in the formal charges after those charges have been deemed admitted. However, the language of § 11(E)(3) does not encompass legal conclusions that flow from the factual allegations. If the legal conclusion the ODC seeks to prove (i.e., a violation of a specific rule) is not readily apparent from the deemed admitted facts, additional evidence may need to be submitted in order to prove the legal conclusions that flow from the admitted factual allegations. In re: Donnan, 01-3058 (La. 1/10/03), 838 So. 2d 715.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The deemed admitted facts in this matter indicate that respondent neglected numerous legal matters, failed to communicate with numerous clients, failed to account for and refund unearned fees, engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in numerous investigations. The record supports a finding that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in both sets of formal charges. Accordingly, having found professional misconduct, the sole issue presented for our consideration is the appropriate sanction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis, 513 So. 2d 1173 (La. 1987). The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington, 459 So. 2d 520 (La. 1984).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The common thread running through the twenty-seven counts of misconduct in this matter is respondent's complete and utter disregard for the welfare of his clients. In virtually every instance, respondent took fees from clients, performed little or no work on their cases, and refused to refund the unearned fees. He has refused to cooperate with the ODC's investigations, and he has made no effort to participate in these disciplinary proceedings, despite receiving several opportunities to present his evidence in mitigation. The baseline sanction for multiple instances of neglect, failure to refund unearned fees and failure to cooperate is disbarment. See, e.g., In re: Brancato, 06-0124 (La. 5/26/06), 932 So. 2d 651; In re: Laque, 03-3539 (La. 6/25/04), 876 So. 2d 753.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Numerous aggravating factors are present, including a history of prior disciplinary offenses,<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a> a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, vulnerability of the victims, substantial experience in the practice of law, and indifference to making restitution. The sole mitigating factor is respondent's personal or emotional problems during part of the time frame at issue.<a name="fnref4" class="fn" href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the record as a whole, we conclude it clearly demonstrates respondent lacks the ethical qualities demanded of lawyers in Louisiana. His actions reveal he is a danger to the citizens of this state. Under these circumstances, he must be disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the board's recommendation and disbar respondent. We will also order respondent to provide accountings to his clients and make restitution by refunding any unearned fees.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committees and the disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that Claud E. Phelps, Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 21811, be and he hereby is disbarred. His name shall be stricken from the roll of attorneys and his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana shall be revoked. It is further ordered that respondent shall provide accountings to his clients and make restitution by refunding any unearned fees. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> The two sets of formal charges were never formally consolidated by order of the board.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">2</a> The day before the hearing, respondent filed an emergency motion to continue, claiming that he was not served with notice of the hearing. The ODC informed the hearing committee chair that notice had been mailed to respondent at both his primary and secondary registration addresses. Therefore, the committee chair denied the continuance.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3" id="fn3">3</a> We give particular weight to this factor. In In re: Phelps, 02-1837 (La. 9/30/02), 827 So. 2d 1140, we concluded respondent's misconduct, which was similar to the instant misconduct, was the product of inexperience. In giving respondent a fully-deferred suspension, we sought to give him an opportunity to correct the problems which caused the misconduct. Through his failure to avail himself of this opportunity, respondent has convincingly demonstrated he lacks the fitness to practice law in this state.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4" class="fn" href="#fnref4" id="fn4">4</a> We recognize respondent suffered a personal loss in October 2003 when his son died. However, this mitigating factor is of limited impact under the instant facts because the majority of the misconduct occurred before this date. See, e.g., In re: Norris, 06-0671 (La. 10/17/06), ___ So. 2d ___.</p>
