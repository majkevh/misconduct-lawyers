  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 06-B-0172</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: ANNE T. TURISSINI</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, Anne T. Turissini, a suspended attorney.</p>

  <h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Before we address the current charges, we find it helpful to review respondent's prior
  disciplinary history. Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in Louisiana in 1985. In June 1995, this court
  suspended respondent for one year and one day, fully deferred, subject to a two-year period of probation with
  conditions, stemming from her failure to communicate with a client, failure to return the client's file upon the
  termination of the representation, and failure to cooperate with the ODC in its disciplinary investigation.
  <span class="cite">In re: Turissini, 95-0735 (La. 6/2/95), <a href="1995-06-02_1995-0735.htm">655 So. 2d
  327</a></span> ("Turissini I"). In 2003, this court considered a proceeding involving three consolidated sets of
  formal charges alleging that respondent neglected legal matters, failed to communicate with her clients, failed to
  refund unearned fees or to place disputed fees in trust, failed to protect a client's interest upon termination of
  the representation, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in several disciplinary investigations. After considering
  the record, this court suspended respondent from the practice of law for three years. <span class="cite">In re:
  Turissini, 03-0549, 03-0550, 03-0551 (La. 6/6/03), <a href="2003-06-06_2003-0549.htm">849 So. 2d 491</a></span>
  ("Turissini II"). Respondent has not yet served the entirety of the suspension imposed in Turissini II; accordingly,
  she remains suspended from the practice of law at this time.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed two sets of formal charges against respondent. The first set, bearing the
  disciplinary board's docket number 03-DB-020, was filed on April 3, 2003 and consists of one count of misconduct. The
  second set, bearing the disciplinary board's docket number 04-DB-034, was filed on March 30, 2004 and likewise
  consists of one count of misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The formal charges were considered by separate hearing committees, then consolidated by order of
  the disciplinary board on January 18, 2005. On January 24, 2006, the disciplinary board filed in this court a single
  recommendation of discipline encompassing both sets of formal charges.</p>

  <h2>03-DB-020</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent represented Ernest Elias in a criminal case. After the representation was concluded,
  Mr. Elias asked respondent to handle a wrongful death claim on his behalf. Respondent filed a petition for damages in
  October 2001, but thereafter she failed to communicate with Mr. Elias and did nothing to move the case forward. In
  June 2002, Mr. Elias filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC, asserting that he had been unable to reach
  respondent and that she would not return his file. In November 2002, at which time respondent was still enrolled as
  counsel of record, she failed to appear at a hearing on a motion to compel responses to discovery in the civil case.
  The trial court rendered judgment ordering that the discovery be answered within twenty days, in default of which Mr.
  Elias' case would be dismissed with prejudice.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A copy of Mr. Elias' complaint was delivered to respondent via certified mail received on August
  15, 2002. Respondent failed to reply to the complaint, necessitating the issuance of a subpoena compelling her to
  appear on February 18, 2003 and answer the complaint under oath. During her sworn statement, respondent testified
  that she filed the wrongful death suit on Mr. Elias' behalf in order to interrupt prescription, but from that point
  on she was simply "trying to find another civil attorney to take the case for me because I'm just not comfortable
  handling civil things alone." She maintained that Mr. Elias knew how to contact her and admitted that she had
  received a request from him for the return of his file. Respondent promised that she would return Mr. Elias' file to
  him immediately; however, it is unclear whether she subsequently did so.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In its formal charges, the ODC alleges that respondent's conduct violated Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a
  client), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a client),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> (obligations upon termination of the representation),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation), and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The formal charges were served upon respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to answer or
  otherwise reply to the formal charges. Accordingly, the factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted
  and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). No formal hearing was
  held, but the parties were given an opportunity to file with the hearing committee written arguments and documentary
  evidence on the issue of sanctions. Respondent filed nothing for the hearing committee's consideration.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-07-30_03-DB-020.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After considering the ODC's submission in response to the deemed admitted order, the hearing
  committee agreed that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges. The
  committee determined that respondent's conduct was knowing and intentional and that she violated duties owed to her
  client and to the profession. The committee found no mitigating factors are present, but in aggravation, noted that
  respondent has previously been disciplined for misconduct that is nearly identical to that at issue here.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering these findings, the committee recommended that respondent be suspended from the
  practice of law for one year and one day.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation in
  03-DB-020.</p>

  <h2>04-DB-034</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In July 2003, Lynn Williams filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. According to Ms.
  Williams, she retained respondent to seek post-conviction relief on behalf of her son, Lawrence Williams. In
  September 2002, Ms. Williams paid respondent $1,850 of an agreed upon $4,000 fee "to start Lawrence's case." From
  September until December 2002, respondent contacted Ms. Williams on a regular basis to discuss the status of the
  case. On December 10, 2002, at which time respondent and Ms. Williams signed a formal retainer agreement, respondent
  gave Ms. Williams a copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Williams which detailed her preliminary efforts in connection
  with the representation. For the next two months, Ms. Williams made phone calls to respondent and visited her office
  on several occasions, but she was never able to speak with respondent. In early February 2003, respondent called Ms.
  Williams to request an additional fee payment "to get started on moving [the] case into court." On February 9, 2003,
  Ms. Williams paid respondent an additional $250, following which she did not hear from respondent again.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In October 2003, the ODC reviewed the record of Mr. Williams' criminal case and determined that
  respondent had never enrolled as counsel on behalf of Mr. Williams, nor had she filed the application for
  post-conviction relief.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A copy of Ms. Williams' complaint was delivered to respondent via certified mail received on
  August 29, 2003. Respondent failed to reply to the complaint. In its formal charges, the ODC alleges that
  respondent's conduct violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 8.1(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The formal charges were served upon respondent by certified mail.<a name="fnref2" class="fn"
  href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a> Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges. Accordingly, the
  factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to
  Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). No formal hearing was held, but the parties were given an opportunity to file
  with the hearing committee written arguments and documentary evidence on the issue of sanctions. Respondent filed
  nothing for the hearing committee's consideration.</p>

  <h3><a href="../HC/2005-01-05_04-DB-034.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After considering the ODC's submission in response to the deemed admitted order, the hearing
  committee agreed that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges. The
  committee determined that respondent violated duties owed to her client and to the profession. She acted knowingly
  and caused actual injury to Mr. Williams, who was unable to seek the post-conviction relief to which he may have been
  entitled had respondent acted in a timely manner. The committee determined that the baseline sanction for
  respondent's misconduct is suspension.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee found that the following aggravating factors are present: prior disciplinary
  offenses, a dishonest or selfish motive, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally
  failing to comply with the rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, vulnerability of the victim, and substantial
  experience in the practice of law (admitted 1985). The committee made no finding of mitigating circumstances.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, and noting that repeated sanctions by this court have not deterred
  respondent "from committing the same type of offenses over and over again," the committee recommended that respondent
  be suspended from the practice of law for eighteen months.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation in
  04-DB-034.</p>

  <h2><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2006-01-19_03-DB-020.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h2>

  <h2>03-DB-020 &amp; 04-DB-034</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the record, the disciplinary board determined that the deemed admitted facts as
  found in the formal charges are not manifestly erroneous, and that respondent violated Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4</span>, <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span>,
  <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct in the
  Elias and Williams matters. Respondent failed to pursue Mr. Elias' wrongful death claim, failed to communicate with
  him, and failed to return his file. She also failed to pursue Mr. Williams' post-conviction relief claim and failed
  to communicate with Mr. Williams, despite the efforts of his family members to call her and go to her office.
  Finally, respondent failed to respond to the complaint filed by Mr. Williams' mother, and had to be compelled by
  subpoena to respond to Mr. Elias' complaint, following which she failed to cooperate with the disciplinary
  investigation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these findings, the board determined that respondent knowingly, if not intentionally,
  violated duties owed to her client and as a professional. She knew she had been paid to perform post-conviction
  relief services for Mr. Williams, but she failed to do anything even after requesting and receiving additional money
  from Mr. Williams' mother.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a> Due to respondent's delay, the
  time expired for Mr. Williams to pursue his post-conviction relief claim. Mr. Elias' wrongful death claim was
  jeopardized due to respondent's failure to answer discovery and to appear for a hearing on a motion to compel.
  Respondent was also cast in judgment for attorney's fees and costs related to the motion. In Mr. Elias' matter,
  respondent was compelled to appear before the ODC pursuant to a subpoena, and she failed to answer the complaint
  relating to her representation of Mr. Williams.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.41</span> of the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer
  Sanctions suggests that disbarment is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for a client, or
  engages in a pattern of neglect with respect to client matters, and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a
  client. Respondent knowingly, if not intentionally, failed to do work for Mr. Elias and Mr. Williams. Both clients
  were actually harmed, in that Mr. Elias' wrongful death claim was subject to dismissal with prejudice<a name="fnref4"
  class="fn" href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a> and Mr. Williams lost his chance at post-conviction relief efforts.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ABA Standard <span class="ABAstandard">7.1</span> suggests that disbarment is appropriate when a
  lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed to the profession with the intent to obtain a
  benefit for the lawyer or another, and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client, the public, or the
  legal system. Ms. Lynn Williams, the mother of Lawrence Williams, paid respondent more than half of her $4,000 fee,
  but no work was ever performed and the fee has not been refunded. Indeed, respondent did not so much as enroll as
  counsel of record in Mr. Williams' case. She also failed to answer the Williams complaint and failed to cooperate in
  the disciplinary investigation in either the Elias or Williams matters. The board concluded that the baseline
  sanction for respondent's misconduct is disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board found that the following aggravating factors are present:
  <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">a pattern of
  misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith
  obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the rules or orders of the
  disciplinary agency</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>, and
  <span class="ABAstandard">indifference to making restitution</span>. The board determined that no mitigating factors
  are present.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Relying on <span class="cite">In re: Frank, 04-0238 (La. 6/25/04),
  <a href="2004-06-25_2004-0238.htm">876 So. 2d 57</a></span>,<a name="fnref5" class="fn" href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a>
  which the board suggested involved misconduct similar to that at issue here, the board recommended that respondent be
  disbarred "for the harm to Mr. Elias and Mr. Williams and to protect the public." The board also recommended that
  respondent be ordered to make restitution to Lynn Williams and to return Mr. Elias' file to him, and that she be
  assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The deemed admitted facts in this case support a finding that respondent violated Rules 1.3, 1.4,
  1.16(d), 8.1(c), and 8.4(g) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. She failed to communicate with Mr. Elias and Mr.
  Williams and failed to pursue the legal matters she was retained to handle. She also failed to return Mr. Elias' file
  to him, despite his numerous requests. Finally, respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of
  the complaints filed against her by Mr. Elias and by Mr. Williams' mother. Therefore, the sole issue presented for
  our consideration is the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed
  to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future
  misconduct. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d
  1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of
  the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a>
  (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Clearly, respondent violated duties owed to her clients, which caused their legal matters to be
  delayed. Respondent also violated duties owed as a professional by not cooperating with the ODC in its investigation
  or participating in these proceedings. Undoubtedly, she acted knowingly, if not intentionally. The baseline sanction
  for this misconduct is a period of suspension.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Several significant aggravating factors are present in the instant case, most notably
  respondent's prior disciplinary matters in Turissini I and Turissini II, both of which involved misconduct identical
  to that at issue in this proceeding. Indeed, our observations in Turissini II are equally applicable here:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A review of the record indicates respondent's misconduct was both knowing and intentional with regard to her
    failure to take any action in her clients' cases, failure to account for and return unearned fees, and failure to
    cooperate with the ODC. She has exhibited a complete disregard for her professional responsibilities owed to her
    clients and the profession. Respondent has expressed no remorse for her actions in depriving her vulnerable clients
    of their funds for several years or jeopardizing their legal matters. She has made no genuine attempt at
    restitution or fee dispute resolution. Respondent's chronic failure to cooperate with the ODC has caused undue
    delays and burdens on an already taxed disciplinary system.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Additionally present are the aggravating factors of a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses,
  bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the rules or orders of
  the disciplinary agency, vulnerability of the victim, substantial experience in the practice of law, and indifference
  to making restitution. There are no mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the numerous aggravating factors present, respondent's prior suspensions, and the
  fact that she has never satisfied the professional obligations she owed to Mr. Elias and to Ms. Williams, we cannot
  say the board's recommendation of disbarment is inappropriate. Accordingly, we will accept the board's recommendation
  and disbar respondent. We will further order that respondent provide a complete accounting to Ms. Williams and refund
  the unearned portion of the legal fee she was paid, and that she return Mr. Elias' file to him.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committees and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Anne T. Turissini, Louisiana Bar Roll number 15060, be and she hereby
  is disbarred. Her name shall be stricken from the roll of attorneys and her license to practice law in the State of
  Louisiana shall be revoked. Respondent is ordered to provide a complete accounting to Lynn Williams and refund the
  unearned portion of the legal fee she was paid. Respondent is further ordered to return Ernest Elias' file to him.
  All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
  10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> The trial court's order also awarded
  the defendant attorney's fees of $500, plus costs, to be paid by respondent by November 27, 2002. It is unclear from
  the record whether respondent complied with the order.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">2</a> The return receipt card was signed by
  respondent personally.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3" id="fn3">3</a> Throughout the board's report, it is
  stated that Ms. Williams paid respondent $2,000 plus an additional $250, for a total of $2,250, to handle the
  post-conviction matter. However, in her complaint, Ms. Williams confirmed that she paid respondent $1,850 plus an
  additional $250, for a total of $2,100.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4" class="fn" href="#fnref4" id="fn4">4</a> The board acknowledged that there  is
  nothing in the record which shows that Mr. Elias' claim was ultimately dismissed; however, the record "substantiates
  unnecessary delays caused by Respondent's actions."</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5" class="fn" href="#fnref5" id="fn5">5</a> In Frank, the respondent knowingly and
  intentionally failed to communicate with his clients, neglected his clients' legal matters, abandoned his clients,
  failed to respond to his clients' requests for information, failed to expedite litigation, failed to account for or
  refund unearned fees, failed to return his clients' files, failed to withhold sums from clients' settlements and/or
  remit payment to third parties, made misrepresentations during settlement negotiations, and failed to cooperate with
  the ODC. For this "persistent and serious professional misconduct," and considering the numerous aggravating factors
  present (including prior disciplinary offenses), we imposed disbarment.</p>
