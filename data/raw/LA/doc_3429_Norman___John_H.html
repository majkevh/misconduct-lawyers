  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: JOHN H. NORMAN</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 01-DB-090</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a petition for consent discipline by
  John H. Norman ("Respondent") of Metairie, Louisiana, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana.
  For reasons stated below, the Disciplinary Board accepts the petition and orders that a public reprimand be issued
  against Respondent.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On September 7, 2001, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") filed two counts of formal
  charges against Respondent. In the first count of the formal charges, ODC alleges Respondent failed to provide
  competent representation, failed to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of his legal matter, failed to
  act with due diligence, failed to take steps to protect his client's interest upon discharge, failed to act as an
  advisor, and failed to exercise proper professional judgment. In the second count, ODC alleges Respondent failed to
  cooperate in the disciplinary investigation of the complaint filed against him.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On September 12, 2001, Respondent was served with the formal charges via certified mail. On
  September 27, 2001, through his counsel, Ralph Capitelli, Respondent filed a motion for extension of time to file an
  answer to the formal charges, which was granted by Jack A. Grant, chair of Hearing Committee Number Eleven, on
  September 28, 2001.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On November 1, 2001, Respondent filed an answer to the formal charges. In his answer, Respondent
  generally denied any violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged and asserted several factors for
  consideration of mitigation of a sanction in the event any ethical liability attached to his actions. The matter was
  then set for hearing before Hearing Committee Number Twenty-Four on February 25, 2002.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On February 19, 2002, the parties filed a joint motion to continue the hearing without date
  pending the filing of a petition for consent discipline. On that same day, Anthony P. Dunbar, chair of Hearing
  Committee Number Twenty-Four, granted the parties' motion and the matter was continued without date.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On March 6, 2002, Respondent filed a petition for consent discipline, stipulation of facts,
  waiver of opportunity to withdraw, and an affidavit in support of consent discipline, wherein he admitted to
  violating Rule 5.4(c)<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent proposes that
  as a result of this violation he be publicly reprimanded. On March 8, 2002, ODC filed its concurrence in the
  petition.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On April 25, 2002, a panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed the documents filed in this matter.
  The parties waived appearances in this matter; therefore, no oral argument was conducted.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The pertinent parts of the formal charges filed in this matter read as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div id="fc01-DB-090">
      <h3>COUNT I</h3>

      <p>In 1999, you enrolled as counsel of record on behalf of Eddie M. Taylor and E &amp; R Trust in a case entitled
      E &amp; R Trust vs. Ragusa, Inc. consolidated with Ragusa Inc. vs. Ed Taylor and E &amp; R Trust, Case Numbers CA
      954 and CA 955 before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal. Prior to that, you met with James "Jim" Quaid and agreed
      to sign-on as counsel of record for Mr. Taylor, to sign the appellate brief, which Mr. Quaid had already prepared
      on Mr. Taylor's behalf and to handle a motion to tax costs. You immediately filed an opposition to the motion to
      tax costs on Mr. Taylor and E &amp; R Trust's behalf. Mr. Taylor, in the meantime, received a letter dated July
      13, 1999 from Mr. Quaid advising that you would be enrolling to handle his legal matters, as previously discussed
      and agreed to by the two of them. Subsequently, Mr. Taylor learned that you had failed to appear to represent
      [him] and E &amp; R Trust at a contradictory hearing held on August 20, 1999 and had failed to timely file a
      brief. Mr. Taylor wrote to you requesting a refund of a four thousand dollar ($4,000.00) retainer fee, which he
      paid to Mr. Quaid to retain your services and requesting to be indemnified for the costs assessed against [him]
      and E &amp; R Trust. You replied by letter dated December 29, 1999 advising Mr. Taylor that Mr. Quaid was not
      your agent, that Mr. Taylor should direct all of his questions to Mr. Quaid, and denying any knowledge of or
      receipt of the four thousand dollar ($4,000) retainer fee. Mr. Taylor was confused because he had met with you at
      least two (2) times to discuss his case and he believed you were representing [him] and E &amp; R Trust, not Mr.
      Quaid. You signed and filed pleadings with the court and consulted with the opposing counsel regarding settlement
      on [his] and E &amp; R Trust's behalf. Additionally, you advised in your letter dated December 29, 1999 that the
      August 20, 1999 hearing was properly handled and that an appearance by you was not required. Your statement was
      an admission that you obviously had knowledge of and was involved in the handling of Mr. Taylor's legal matters.
      Additionally, you admitted to signing your name to documents prepared by Mr. Quaid, a disbarred attorney and
      failing to fully review those documents.</p>

      <p>You did not properly handle Mr. Taylor's case. Mr. Taylor had to formally discharge you, hire and pay another
      attorney four thousand dollars ($4,000.00) to perform the same legal services that he believed you were handling
      based on the conversations with you and the agreement through Mr. Quaid. You never formally withdrew as counsel
      of record from the case as requested by Mr. Taylor. You have failed to provide competent representation, failed
      to keep your client reasonably informed about the status of the case, failed to act with due diligence, failed to
      take steps to protect your client's interest upon discharge, and you failed to act as an advisor. Additionally,
      you violated the Rules of Professional Conduct by acting at the direction of a disbarred attorney. You are
      responsible for Mr. Quaid's conduct because you had knowledge of it and ratified it. Also, you engaged in conduct
      involving dishonesty, deceit, and misrepresentation and conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of
      justice. Your conduct has violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.1</span><a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a>,
      <span class="allegedrules">1.2</span><a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a>,

      Conduct.</p>

      <h3>COUNT II</h3>

      <p>In conjunction with the complaint file of Eddie M. Taylor, on October 3, 2000 the Office of Disciplinary
      Counsel requested a supplemental response to the complaint of Eddie Taylor within fifteen (15) days pursuant to
      Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 4 B (2). You failed, refused and neglected to respond to the October 3, 2000
      letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. As a result of your failure to cooperate, a subpoena was
      requested and issued for your appearance to provide your file and to give your sworn statement in this matter.
      You were personally served with the subpoena on November 3, 2000 to appear at the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
      on November 28, 2000. On November 28, 2000, you appeared and gave your sworn statement. You have failed to
      cooperate with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel in violation of Rules
      <span class="allegedrules">8.1</span><a class="fn" href="#fn12">12</a> and <span class="allegedrules">8.4
      (a)(g)</span><a class="fn" href="#fn13">13</a> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

      <p>(Footnotes added).</p>
    </div>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>STIPULATION OF FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent provides the following information in the stipulation of facts filed in this
  matter:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <h3>I.</h3>

    <p>John H. Norman was admitted to practice law on October 5, 1973. Since 1991, John H. Norman has been a solo
    practitioner.</p>

    <h3>II.</h3>

    <p>John H. Norman has had no prior discipline during his years of practice.</p>

    <h3>III.</h3>

    <p>In this investigative file number 11800, John H. Norman was contacted by James F. Quaid and agreed to sign on as
    counsel of record for Mr. Quaid's acquaintance, Eddie Taylor, in a case entitled E&amp;R Trust v. Ragusa, Inc.
    consolidated with Ragusa, Inc. v. Ed Taylor and E&amp;R Trust. Additionally, Mr. Quaid requested that John H.
    Norman sign his name to an appellate brief, which had been previously prepared by Mr. Quaid, and handle a Motion to
    Tax Costs by filing an opposition to the motion, which had also been previously prepared by Mr. Quaid. John H.
    Norman admits to signing on as attorney of record but denies actually representing Mr. Taylor in this case; it
    appears that Mr. Quaid was responsible for handling the representation or at least for directing how the
    representation would take place. As a result, John H. Norman signed his signature to documents and pleadings
    prepared by Mr. Quaid without properly reviewing those documents or using his own professional judgment in handling
    the representation of Mr. Taylor's case. John H. Norman initially believed that Mr. Quaid was a retired attorney
    but subsequently learned that James F. Quaid was in fact a disbarred attorney.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rule
  <span class="Rules">5.4(c)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The Board must accept that Respondent has
  violated this rule. <span class="CITE"><i>In re Lieberman,</i> 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96); <a 
  href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given the violation of this rule, the Board is left
  to determine if the proposed sanction of public reprimand is appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the
    profession;</li>

    <li>whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</li>

    <li>the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</li>

    <li>the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon a review of the documents, the Board finds that Respondent negligently violated duties
  owed to his client, Eddie Taylor. The Board further finds that Mr. Taylor has been harmed by Respondent's actions. An
  attorney's failure to properly exercise his or her professional judgment deprives the client of an opportunity to
  reap the full benefits of an attorney-client relationship.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon the assertions contained in the stipulation of facts, ODC's concurrence, and
  Respondent's affidavit in support of the consent discipline, the Board finds that the following mitigating factors
  are present: (1) <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>; (2)
  <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest or selfish motive</span>; (3) <span class="ABAstandard">full and
  free disclosure to the Disciplinary Board</span>, with a cooperative attitude toward these proceedings; and (4)
  <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>. The only aggravating factor apparent in this matter is Respondent's
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <h3>I. ABA Standards</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanction
  ("Standard") to determine the baseline sanction by determining "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's mental state
  and the extent of the injury caused; and then adjust[ing] the sanction in accordance with the aggravating and
  mitigating factors present." <span class="CITE"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94); <a 
  href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 350</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The proposed sanction is in line with the ABA guidelines. Under A.B.A. Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.33</span>, a "[r]eprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent in
  determining whether the representation of a client may be materially affected by the lawyer's own interests, or
  whether the representation will adversely affect another client, and causes injury or potential injury to a client."
  The comments to this standard state that "courts generally impose a reprimand when a lawyer engages in a single
  instance of misconduct involving a conflict of interest when the lawyer has merely been negligent and there is no
  overreaching or serious injury to a client."</p>

  <h3>II. Relevant Case Law</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board also looks to relevant case law for assistance in determining an appropriate sanction
  for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Although addressing different rule violations, the case of
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Williams</i>, <a  href="2001-06-21_00-DB-128.htm">00-DB-128</a> (Disc. Bd.
  Op. 6/21/2001)</span>, offers guidance here.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In Williams, the Board accepted a joint petition for consent discipline and imposed a public
  reprimand for an attorney's violations of Rules 5.3(b) (failure to properly supervise a nonlawyer employee), 8.1(c)
  (failure to cooperate) and 8.4(g) (failure to cooperate) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. In support of the
  petition, the parties filed a stipulation of facts in which the attorney admitted he had employed a suspended
  attorney, who had sent out correspondence without supervision by Williams. This correspondence gave the impression
  that the suspended attorney was holding himself out as an attorney. Additionally, Williams admitted that he failed to
  fully cooperate with ODC in its investigation of two other complaints filed against him. <i>Bd. Op. at p.1</i>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Although the Board recognizes distinctions between this matter and Williams, they are similar in
  that in both instances an attorney has assisted a suspended or disbarred attorney engage in actions which appear to
  involve the unauthorized practice of law. Furthermore, the fact that the Board imposed a sanction of public reprimand
  in Williams, which included the additional misconduct of failure to cooperate with ODC, supports the conclusion that
  the misconduct in this matter does not warrant a more substantial discipline.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, the Board has determined that, after considering all the facts and circumstances of
  this matter, a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction for Respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the petition for consent discipline be accepted, and
  that a public reprimand be issued against the Respondent, John H. Norman. It is further ordered that Respondent be
  assessed the costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the
  date of finality of this Ruling until paid.</p>
