<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>PER CURIAM*</p>
<p>***************************************************************************<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font size="3"> This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from two sets of formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) against respondent, Russell Alan Chaney, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana.' The charges allege respondent failed to adequately represent his clients, failed to keep his clients reasonably informed, failed to return unearned fees and provide an accounting when requested, and failed to keep his clients' funds separate, converting those funds to his own use. In addition, the charges allege respondent entered a plea of guilty to possession of cocaine and was sentenced to three years imprisonment.<br>

<p><font size="3"><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ODC initially filed formal charges against respondent in </font><span class="CITE">96-DB-071</span> on September 26, 1996, alleging the conduct involving Mr. Morgan violated <span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"><font face='Times New Roman'>Rules </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.3'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.4'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a>(c), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a>(d), and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a>(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<font face='Times New Roman'><sup>4&nbsp; </sup></font><font size="3"><sup> </sup></font><font size="3">Respondent did not </font><font size="3">timely answer these charges,&nbsp; but eventually did submit a response, and the ODC requested that respondent's answer be entered into the record for consideration.

<p>
<p><font size="3"><b>Hearing Committee Recommendation</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite requesting and being granted a continuance, respondent did not attend the formal hearing. The ODC called several witnesses to substantiate the formal charges against the respondent. Based on the evidence submitted, the committee found the ODC proved by clear and convincing evidence all of the counts charged in</font><span class="CITE"> 96-DB-071 and 98-DB-040.</span></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The committee noted that although the respondent eventually submitted a written </font><span class="BodyText"><font color="#000000">denial of the allegations and formal charges against him, the denials &quot;pale in comparison&nbsp; to the overwhelming evidence against him.&quot;&nbsp; The committee concluded respondent had violated </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"><font face='Times New Roman'>Rules </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.1'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.3'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.4'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.5'></a>(f)(6), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.16'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE5.5'></a>(a), and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a>(a)(b)(c) and (d) of the <br>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The disciplinary board concurred in the hearing committee's findings that the formal charges were proved by clear and convincing evidence.</font><font size="3"><sup>6</sup></font><font size="3">&nbsp; As aggravating </font><font size="3">circumstances, the disciplinary board found the following: dishonest or selfish motive; pattern of misconduct; multiple offenses; refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing; vulnerability of the victims; indifference to making restitution; and substantial legal experience in the practice of law. The board also found the following mitigating factors: absence of a prior disciplinary record, and physical or mental disability or impairment.<br>

</font><font size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The record supports the findings of the hearing committee and disciplinary board.</font><span class="BodyText"><font color="#000000">The numerous counts of misconduct against respondent reflect he has a total disregard for his professional obligations. His conversion of client funds and neglect of client matters demonstrates he is a danger to the public. Under these circumstances, we conclude disbarment is the appropriate sanction.</font></span></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and the disciplinary board, and after consideration of the record filed herein, it is the decision of the court that the </font><font face='Times New Roman'>name of Russell Alan Chaney be stricken from the roll of attorneys</font><font size="3">, and that his </font><font face='Times New Roman'>license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked</font><font size="3">.
