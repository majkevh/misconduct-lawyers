  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">LOUISIANA ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: PETER Q. JOHN</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 99-DB-028</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">  This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a petition for consent discipline. 
  Formal charges have been filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.  The Respondent in this matter is Peter Q. John
  of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. </p>

  <h2><b>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</b></h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">  Formal charges, consisting of one count, were filed against Respondent on April 21, 1999, based
  upon Respondent's solicitation of the personal injury claim of Ms. Lucille H. Avants.  Respondent filed an answer to
  the formal charges on May 14, 1999, generally denying all allegations.  On June 14, 1999, the Respondent filed a
  petition for consent discipline seeking a public reprimand and supervised probation for a period of two years with
  conditions.  The ODC filed its concurrence to the consent discipline on June 18, 1999. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">  A panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter on July 29, 1999.  At the hearing, the
  Respondent was represented by Milton P. Masinter and Emily S. Morrison; the ODC was represented by Chief Disciplinary
  Counsel Charles Plattsmier.</p>

  <h2><b>FORMAL CHARGES</b></h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">As noted above, the formal charges consist only of one count.  This count initially points out
  that the Respondent was admitted to the Bar in the Fall of  1998. The count further alleges that through his fiancee
  the Respondent learned that Ms. Lucille H. Avants, a resident of a Baton Rouge based nursing home, fell and sustained
  severe personal injury.  Conduct of the nursing home either prior to or after the fall allegedly created a cause of
  action in favor of Ms. Avants against the nursing home or its employees.  The Respondent allegedly sent a plant to
  Ms. Avants' room with a card instructing Ms. Avants or her family member to contact him.  Respondent claimed to have
  special knowledge of the nursing home's conditions.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The formal charges further state that Ms. Avants is the mother of Mrs. Fran Stringer, the wife of
  Judge Byron Stringer of the City Court of Baton Rouge.  Mrs. Stringer contacted Respondent pursuant to his
  instructions on the card received with the plant.  At that time, the Respondent allegedly solicited Ms. Avants'
  personal injury claim in exchange for providing information regarding the conditions in the nursing home.  Mrs.
  Stringer advised the Respondent that she would get back in touch with him.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Judge Stringer and his wife then contacted the Office of Disciplinary Counsel about the unwanted
  solicitation and asked for the assistance of that office.  Thereafter, Judge and Mrs. Stringer contacted the
  Respondent and asked him to meet with them at a local coffee shop.  They were accompanied by ODC investigator Damon
  Manning who posed as the son of Judge and Mrs. Stringer whose name was "Todd."  The encounter at the coffee shop
  confirmed the Respondent's effort to solicit Ms. Avants' personal injury claim. The ODC alleges that the Respondent's
  conduct violated Rule of Professional Conduct <span class="allegedrules">7.2</span>.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"
  class="fn" id="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>

  <h2><b>REQUEST FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE AND CONCURRENCE BY ODC</b></h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent admits to the allegations of misconduct as set out in count I of the formal charges. 
  Respondent therefore proposes the following discipline:</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">A public reprimand;</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Supervised probation for a period of two (2) years with the following conditions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">a.  Respondent agrees to attend and successfully complete one full session at the Ethics School
    held bi-annually by the Louisiana State Bar Association Practice Assistance and Improvement Committee;   </p>

    <p class="inverted">b.  Respondent will promptly and completely respond to any and all disciplinary complaints
    which may be lodged against him;</p>

    <p class="inverted">c.  Respondent will not violate any Rule of Professional Conduct during the period of
    probation;</p>

    <p class="inverted">d. Respondent will promptly pay any and all disciplinary costs affiliated with the disciplinary
    investigation and these disciplinary proceedings.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC filed its concurrence with the proposed consent discipline on June 18, 1999.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1)whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system,
    or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2)whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4)the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Board finds that Respondent has violated duties owed to the public, the legal system and the
  profession.  The Board also finds that the Respondent acted intentionally and knowingly.  Although ultimately no
  actual injury was caused by the Respondent's misconduct, potential injury existed in that Ms. Avants or her family
  members could have hired Respondent to take this matter in "exchange" for his information concerning the nursing
  home.   </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The following Standard 9.32 mitigating factors present are: <span class="ABAstandard">absence of
  evidence of similar conduct by Respondent</span>; Respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">inexperience in the practice
  of law</span> (only several months); and Respondent's genuine <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Board notes that Respondent's conduct presents a serious violation of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.  As stated by the Louisiana Supreme Court in <span class="cite"><u>In re</u> <u>D'Amico</u>,
   <a href="../SC/1996-02-28_1994-3005.htm">688 So.2d 730</a>, 733 (La. 1996)</span>,  "direct solicitation of
  professional employment from a prospective client . . . is a very serious disciplinary violation that undermines the
  reputation of lawyers generally and the public's attitude toward the profession."  In many similar instances,
  suspension would be the appropriate sanction.<a name="_ednref2" class="fn" href="#_edn2" id="_ednref2">[ii]</a>
  However, after careful consideration of the mitigating circumstances at hand, particularly the absence of evidence of
  similar conduct by Respondent and his inexperience in the practice of law, the Board accepts the proposed
  discipline.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In consent disciplines, the Board may reject the proposed discipline as too lenient, but when
  Respondent and disciplinary counsel have agreed that a violation has occurred, it may not reject consent discipline
  claiming that there was no violation.  See <span class="cite"><u>In re: Lieberman</u>, <a 
  href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So.2d 272</a> (La. 1996)</span>.</p>

  <h2><b>RULING</b></h2>

  <p class="bodycopy"> The Disciplinary Board therefore orders that Respondent, Peter Q. John, be issued a public
  reprimand and be placed on supervised probation for a period of two years with the following conditions: </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">a.  Respondent will attend and successfully complete one full session at the Ethics School held
    bi-annually by the Louisiana State Bar Association Practice Assistance and Improvement Committee;</p>

    <p class="inverted">b.  Respondent will promptly and completely respond to any and all disciplinary complaints
    which may be lodged against him;</p>

    <p class="inverted">c.  Respondent will not violate any Rule of Professional Conduct during the period of
    probation;</p>

    <p class="inverted">d.  Respondent will promptly pay any and all disciplinary costs affiliated with the
    disciplinary investigation and these disciplinary proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days
    from the date of finality of this Ruling until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a id="_edn1" name="_edn1" class="fn" href="#_ednref1">[i]</a> Rule 7.2 provides in part:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">  "(a) A lawyer shall not solicit professional employment in person, by person to person
    verbal telephone contact or through others acting at his request or on his behalf from a prospective client with
    whom the lawyer has no family or prior professional relationship when a significant motive for the lawyer's doing
    so is the lawyer's pecuniary gain."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2" class="fn" id="_edn2">[ii]</a> Pursuant to <i>A.B.A.
  Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, Standard 7.2, suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer
  knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional, and causes injury or potential
  injury to a client, the public, or the legal system.  The commentary to Rule 7.2 explains that suspension is
  appropriate when a lawyer solicits employment knowing that the individual is in a "vulnerable state." </p>
