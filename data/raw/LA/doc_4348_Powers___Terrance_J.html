<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="signature">PER CURIAM <a class="fn" href="#fn_">*</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from four

 the State of Louisiana, but currently under suspension.<a href="#fn1">FN1</a>&nbsp;

<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<h3>Count I</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In November 1995, Julius W. Lewis, Jr. retained respondent 
 to pursue a personal injury claim. Respondent failed to communicate with his 
 client, did little or no work in the matter, and allowed the claim to 
 prescribe. After Mr. Lewis complained to the ODC concerning respondent's 
 conduct, respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC and did not file a 
 response to Mr. Lewis' complaint.</p>
<h3>Count II</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">George L. Ben&eacute; retained respondent in April 1996 to handle a 
 paternity matter. Mr. Ben&eacute; paid respondent a $1,000 fee, but respondent did 
 little or no work in the matter. Respondent abandoned his client, failed to 
 communicate with him, and failed to account for or return any unearned fee.</p>
<h3>Count III</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was sent a copy of a complaint filed by Mr. Ben&eacute; 
 concerning the matter which is the subject of Count II. Respondent failed to 
 reply to the complaint. On December 1, 1997, respondent was personally served 
 with a subpoena to appear before the ODC to testify in the Ben&eacute; matter. 
 Respondent failed to appear at the appointed time.</p>
<h3>Count IV</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Ernest Netherland retained respondent in December 1995 to 
 handle a child custody matter. Although respondent initially completed some 
 work in the matter, including filing a rule for child support in January 1997, 
 respondent thereafter did little or nothing on behalf of his client and failed 
 to complete the matter. Respondent abandoned his client, failed to communicate 
 with him, failed to account for or return any unearned fee, and failed to 
 return the client's file upon request. Furthermore, after Mr. Netherland 
 complained to the ODC concerning respondent's conduct, respondent failed to 
 cooperate with the ODC and did not file a response to Mr. Netherland's 
 complaint.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">After the ODC filed the formal charges, respondent failed to 
 answer. Accordingly, no formal hearing was conducted, and the matter was 
 submitted on documentary evidence only.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:98-DB-064.HC --#">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee found respondent's misconduct was at 
 least knowing, if not intentional, and that his clients' legal matters were 
 delayed as a result. Furthermore, respondent's failure to respond to the 
 complaints against him delayed the disciplinary process, diverted its limited 
 resources, and impaired the orderly functioning of the system. Finally, the 
 committee pointed out that respondent still owes unearned fees of $1,000 to Mr. 
 Ben&eacute; and $600 to Mr. Netherland.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The committee found the following aggravating factors: prior 
 discipline,&nbsp; (<a href="#fn2">FN2</a>) dishonest or selfish motive, pattern 
 of misconduct, obstruction of the disciplinary investigation, vulnerability of 
 the victims, and indifference to making restitution. The committee found no 
 mitigating factors. Under the circumstances, the hearing committee recommended 
 that respondent be suspended for at least three years and ordered to pay 
 restitution to his clients.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:98-DB-064.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board concurred in the findings of the 
 hearing committee. The board found that respondent has violated duties owed to 
 his clients, the legal profession, and the public, and has engaged in knowing 
 and intentional misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Under the circumstances, the board agreed that the baseline 
 sanction for respondent's conduct is suspension. As aggravating factors, it 
 recognized prior discipline, dishonest or selfish motive, pattern of 
 misconduct, multiple offenses, obstruction of the disciplinary process, refusal 
 to acknowledge wrongdoing, vulnerability of the victims, indifference to making 
 restitution, and substantial legal experience in the practice of law. The board 
 also noted that respondent is ineligible to practice law for failing to fulfill 
 his CLE requirements and for failing to pay his bar dues and disciplinary 
 assessment. The board found no mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In light of respondent's prior disciplinary history, 
 including the fact that he is currently suspended, and considering the 
 significant aggravating factors and the absence of mitigating factors, the 
 board concluded there was no reason to deviate from the baseline sanction. 
 Accordingly, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the 
 practice of law for three years, to run consecutively with respondent's current 
 suspension. The board further recommended that respondent be assessed with all 
 costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence 
 running thirty days from the date of finality of the court's judgment until 
 paid.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this 
 court to the board's recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record clearly supports the disciplinary board's 
 findings that respondent has neglected his clients' legal matters, has failed 
 to communicate with his clients, and has failed to account for or return 
 unearned fees. On at least one occasion, respondent's neglect resulted in his 
 client's claim prescribing. Moreover, the current matters involve the same type 
 of misconduct for which this court suspended respondent only nine months ago. 
 Respondent has also failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of 
 these matters, further compounding his misconduct. Under these circumstances, 
 the lengthy suspension recommended by the disciplinary board is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the recommendation of the 
 disciplinary board and suspend respondent from the practice of law for a period 
 of three years, to run consecutively with respondent's current suspension.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the 
 disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is the decision of this 
 court that the recommendation of the disciplinary board be accepted. 
 Accordingly, it is ordered that Terrance J. Powers be suspended from the 
 practice of law for three years, to run consecutively with respondent's current 
 suspension. Respondent is further ordered to make full restitution to his 
 clients. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent 
 in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10.1, with legal interest to 
 commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until 
 paid.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn_">FN*</a>&nbsp; Traylor, J. not on panel. 
 Rule IV, Part II, &sect; 3.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">FN1</a> On January 29, 1999, this court 
 suspended respondent for one year and one day for failing to represent his 
 client with competence and diligence, failing to communicate with his client, 
 failing to refund an unearned fee, failing to comply with CLE requirements, and 
 failing to cooperate with the ODC. See&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: 
 Powers</i>, 98-2826 (La.1/29/99), <a href="#!-- #ID:731 So.2d 185 --#">731 So.2d 
 185</a></span>.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">FN2</a> Respondent was admonished in 1996 
 and again in 1997 for misconduct similar to that charged in the instant matter, 
 and as noted above, this court suspended him in January 1999 for one year and 
 one day.<br>
