  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE:  T. MICHAEL JORDAN</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 99-DB-094</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a Joint Petition for Consent Discipline
  (herein "Petition") by the respondent T. Michael Jordan (herein "Respondent"), of Lake Charles, Louisiana, and the
  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (herein "ODC") prior to the filing of formal charges.  The Board accepts the Joint
  Petition and orders a public reprimand be issued against the Respondent.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">In January 1999, ODC received complaints from two clients of Respondent.  On September 21, 1999,
  Respondent and ODC filed the Petition recommending a sanction of public reprimand. The matter was scheduled to be
  reviewed by a Board panel on November 18, 1999.  However, ODC filed a motion to continue the matter on the grounds
  that new facts may require an amendment to the consent discipline.  The continuance was granted without date.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On May 15, 2000, ODC and Respondent filed Stipulated Facts to the Petition, and ODC filed a
  Memorandum regarding the Petition, which remained the same as originally submitted.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On July 27, 2000, a panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter. Deputy Counsel James T.
  Daly represented the ODC. Respondent did not appear.</p>

  <h2><b>STIPULATED FACTS</b></h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The stipulated facts submitted by the parties in connection with the Joint Petition for Consent
  Discipline are as follows:</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Complainant Brenda Primeaux retained Respondent to represent her in a divorce proceeding. 
  Although the petition for divorce was filed in October 1997, Respondent failed to file the Judgment of Divorce even
  though both counsel signed it.  Complainant had great difficulty in contacting the Respondent.  Finally, Primeaux
  retained another attorney and obtained her divorce.  Respondent was not paid any fees for the work he had
  performed.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Complainant Tammie Lynn Clark engaged Respondent to have her name changed.  In October 1998,
  Respondent served the necessary pleadings on the District Attorney.  However, Respondent did not file the petition
  and have the judgment signed until February 1999.  During most of the representation, Clark was unable to reach the
  Respondent.</p>

  <h2><b>REQUEST FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE AND CONCURRENCE BY ODC</b></h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based upon the Petition and the stipulated facts, ODC asserts that Respondent's conduct violated
  duties owed to his clients.  In each case, Respondent agrees that his conduct violated Rule 1.3<a href="#_edn1"
  name="_ednref1" title="" id="_ednref1">1</a> (duty to act with reasonable diligence) and Rule 1.4<a href="#_edn2"
  name="_ednref2" title="" id="_ednref2">2</a> (failure to communicate with client).  In the Petition, the parties
  agree that, under the A.B.A.'s <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, Section 9, the aggravating factors of
  9.22(i) (<span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>)<a href="#_edn3"
  name="_ednref3" title="" id="_ednref3">3</a> and 9.22(d) (<span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>), and
  the mitigating factor of 9.32(a) (<span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>) apply. 
  Respondent tenders a conditional admission to the misconduct in exchange for a public reprimand.  ODC concurs with
  the consent discipline and recommends its acceptance to the Board.</p>

  <h2><b>ANALYSIS</b></h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span> and <span class="Rules">1.4</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  The Board
  must accept that Respondent has violated these rules.  <span class="cite"><i>In re
  Lieberman</i></span><span class="cite"><i>,</i> 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96); <a 
  href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So.2d 272</a></span>. Given the violation of Rules 1.3 and 1.4, the Board
  is left to determine if the proposed sanction of a public reprimand is appropriate.  The Louisiana Supreme Court
  relies on the A.B.A.'s <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> to determine the baseline sanction by "the type
  of duty violated, the lawyer's mental state and the extent of the injury caused; and then adjust the sanction in
  accordance with the aggravating and mitigating factors present." <span class="cite"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La.
  11/30/94); <a  href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So.2d 343</a>, 350</span> (citing, A.B.A.'s
  <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanction</i>).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The proposed sanction is in line with the A.B.A. guidelines and case law.  Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span> provides for reprimand when "a lawyer is negligent and does not act with
  reasonable diligence in representing a client, and causes injury or potential injury to a client."  Although
  complainant Primeaux had to obtain new legal counsel to obtain her divorce, the record is void of any injury to her. 
  She did not pay Respondent any fees.  After four months, Respondent completed Clark's request for a legal name
  change.  Both complainants incurred time delays but the record does not indicate any harm or potential harm to
  either.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In the case of <span class="cite"><i>In re Laiche</i>, Docket No.
  <a href="1999-07-15_98-DB-057.htm">98-DB-057</a> (7/15/99)</span>, the attorney and ODC filed a Joint Motion for
  Consent Discipline by public reprimand for five counts involving failure to keep his clients informed; failure to
  diligently move the case along over eight years; failure to inform clients of a settlement offer, which he rejected;
  upon being discharged by his clients, he refused to hand over the files and execute a motion to substitute counsel
  for months and respondent failed to respond to the disciplinary complaint.  Based on <i>Laiche</i> and the A.B.A.
  guidelines, the baseline sanction is a public reprimand.  The aggravating factors of substantial legal experience and
  multiple offenses do not appear to elevate Respondent's conduct above <i>Laiche</i>.  A public reprimand appears to
  be the appropriate sanction in this matter.</p>

  <h2><b>RULING</b></h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the petition for consent discipline be accepted, and
  that a public reprimand be issued against the respondent, T. Michael Jordan, for his violations of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct. It is further ordered that Respondent be assessed the costs and expenses of these proceedings,
  with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this ruling until paid. Finally, it
  is ordered that in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 17(B), notice of this reprimand shall be published
  in the journal of the state bar and in a newspaper of general circulation in the parishes of Lafayette and
  Calcasieu.</p>
