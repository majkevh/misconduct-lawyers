<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 01-B-2461</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: STEPHEN E. CAILLOUET</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<h2>PER<b> </b>CURIAM<b><a class="fn" href="#fn_">*</a></b></h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from a petition for consent discipline filed 
by respondent, Stephen E. Caillouet, following the institution of formal charges 
by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”). The ODC concurred in respondent’s 
petition, and the disciplinary board recommended the proposed consent discipline 
be accepted.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">The underlying facts of this matter are set forth in detail in 
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Toups</i>, 
00-0634 (La. 11/28/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:773%20So.2d%20709 --#">773 So. 2d 709</a></span>. Essentially, respondent and Louis Toups 
are Assistant District Attorneys in Lafourche Parish. Both are also permitted to 
maintain private civil practices while holding their public positions. In 1997, 
respondent and Mr. Toups represented Todd and Ellen Ordoyne, respectively, in 
connection with a divorce and community property matter. During the pendency of 
the divorce proceedings, Mrs. Ordoyne caused a simple battery charge to be filed 
in Lafourche Parish against her husband. The charge was later continued without 
date by respondent and Mr. Toups. When Mrs. Ordoyne learned of this, she 
confronted the Lafourche Parish District Attorney, who subsequently ordered 
respondent and Mr. Toups to withdraw from the Ordoyne civil matter. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Mrs. Ordoyne filed a complaint with the ODC on June 10, 1997. The ODC 
commenced an investigation, and on July 29, 1998, filed one count of formal 
charges against respondent and Mr. Toups jointly. As to respondent, the ODC 
alleged that his conduct in continuing the Ordoyne criminal case violated Rules 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#! -- ID:RULE1.7 --#">1.7</a></span> (conflict of interest) and
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a></span>(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the 
administration of justice) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> Respondent 
answered the formal charges and denied any misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Before the matter proceeded to a formal hearing before a hearing committee, 
respondent tendered a petition for consent discipline in which he admitted to an 
“unintentional” violation of Rule 1.7. Respondent conceded that he had neglected 
to recognize that the representation of his private client had the potential to 
conflict with the representation of his public client, the State of Louisiana. 
For his misconduct, respondent proposed that he be publicly reprimanded. The ODC 
concurred in the petition and acknowledged that respondent had acted without 
improper motive or intent. However, the disciplinary board deferred ruling on 
the proposed consent discipline pending the filing of the hearing committee’s 
recommendation with respect to the formal charges against Mr. Toups.<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After a <a href="#!-- #ID:98-DB-053.HC --#">hearing committee</a> recommended that the charges against Mr. Toups be 
dismissed, respondent moved to withdraw his petition for consent discipline. 
Over the ODC’s objection, the disciplinary board permitted respondent to 
withdraw the petition. The ODC sought review of the ruling in this court. On 
October 27, 2000, this court permitted respondent to withdraw his petition for 
consent discipline and remanded the matter to the ODC for prosecution of the 
formal charges filed against respondent. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Caillouet</i>, 00-0771, 00-0824 (La. 
10/27/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:771%20So.2d%20638 --#">771 So. 2d 638</a></span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Meanwhile, the ODC had also sought review in this court of the recommendation 
that the formal charges against Mr. Toups be dismissed. On November 28, 2000, we 
rendered our opinion in Toups, in which we concluded that the disciplinary board 
erred in recommending the charges against Mr. Toups be dismissed. We 
specifically found that once criminal charges were filed, Mr. Toups had an 
obvious conflict of interest between his public and private clients and should 
have withdrawn from further representation. We imposed discipline upon Mr. Toups, 
publicly reprimanding him for his misconduct in the Ordoyne civil matter, and 
suspending him from the practice of law for six months, fully deferred, subject 
to a two-year period of probation in connection with a second count, involving 
unrelated, but similar, misconduct.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">In light of our opinion in Toups, respondent filed a second petition for 
consent discipline. Acknowledging the court’s ruling in Toups, respondent 
conceded that his conduct in the Ordoyne civil matter constituted an 
impermissible conflict of interest. For his misconduct, respondent proposed that 
he be suspended from the practice of law for six months, fully deferred, subject 
to a six-month period of probation. The ODC concurred in respondent’s petition.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-138.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board found that respondent negligently violated a duty owed 
to his client. The board also pointed out respondent’s acknowledgment that he 
caused unintended harm and injury to Mrs. Ordoyne and the criminal justice 
system in Lafourche Parish. The board noted only one aggravating factor, namely 
substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted 1976), but found several 
mitigating factors, including the absence of a prior disciplinary record, a 
cooperative attitude toward the proceedings, remorse, and absence of a dishonest 
or selfish motive. Relying on the ABA’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer 
Sanctions,<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> the board suggested that a reprimand is the baseline sanction for 
respondent’s negligent violation of Rule 1.7 of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct. After considering Toups, the board concluded that the proposed 
discipline is appropriate. In particular, the board noted that respondent’s 
conduct in the Ordoyne matter was very similar to Mr. Toups’ conduct in the 
Harris matter (the second count of the formal charges against Mr. Toups), for 
which this court declined to deviate downward from the baseline sanction of a 
suspension. Based on this reasoning, the board recommended that respondent be 
suspended from the practice of law for six months, fully deferred, subject to a 
six-month period of probation. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board’s 
recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">In our opinion in Toups, we explained that when a conflict exists between an 
attorney’s prosecutorial duties and his representation of a private client, the 
attorney has a duty to withdraw from representation of the private client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After considering the important policy reasons behind avoiding conflicts of 
interest between a district attorney's prosecutorial rule on behalf of the state 
and his duty to protect the interests of his civil clients, we find that, in 
order to comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct, a district attorney must 
immediately withdraw from the civil representation of a client when there is 
substantial reason to believe that charges of criminal conduct have been or will 
be filed by or against the civil client. When criminal charges have been filed 
against a civil client, this rule applies even if the criminal charges are 
unrelated to the civil representation.</p>
<p><span class="CITE"><i>In re: Toups</i>, 00-0634, p.11 (La. 11/28/00), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:773%20So.2d%20709 --#">773 So. 2d 709</a>, 716</span>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent did not withdraw from the civil representation when he learned of 
the filing of the criminal charges against Mr. Ordoyne.<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> Accordingly, discipline 
is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In <i>Toups</i>, we held the baseline sanction for failing to withdraw under these 
facts was suspension.<a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> In light of the mitigating factors present in Toups, we 
imposed a fully deferred six-month suspension for this conduct. Similar factors 
are present in the instant case. Accordingly, we will accept the petition for 
consent discipline and impose a six-month suspension, fully deferred.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and 
considering the record filed herein, it is ordered that Stephen E. Caillouet be 
suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of six months. Said 
suspension shall be deferred in full, subject to a six-month period of 
probation. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent 
in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to 
commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s judgment until 
paid.<br>

<p class="footnotetext">&nbsp;<a name="fn_">*</a> Retired Judge Robert L. Lobrano, assigned as 
Justice Pro Tempore, participating in the decision.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> As to Mr. Toups, the formal charges alleged that he 
failed to report respondent’s misconduct in the Ordoyne criminal case. In a 
second count of misconduct involving another civil client, Mr. Toups allegedly 
used his position as an assistant district attorney to continue a simple battery 
charge filed against the client by his former wife.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> The formal charges against Mr. Toups were severed after 
respondent filed his petition for consent discipline. The severed charges were 
then presented to a hearing committee as to Mr. Toups alone.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> Compare Standard 4.32, under which suspension is 
appropriate when a lawyer knows of a conflict of interest and does not fully 
disclose to a client the possible effect of that conflict, and causes injury or 
potential injury to a client, with Standard 4.33, which provides that a 
reprimand is appropriate when a lawyer is negligent in determining whether the 
representation of a client will adversely affect another client, and causes 
injury or potential injury to a client.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> This is particularly true in light of the fact that 
respondent’s representation of Mr. Ordoyne in the civil matter was adverse to 
his representation of the state.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">5</a> We imposed a public reprimand in count I of Toups based 
on Mr. Toups’ failure to report a conflict of interest. However, we found the 
second count, which involved engaging in the conflict of interest, required 
greater discipline.</p>
