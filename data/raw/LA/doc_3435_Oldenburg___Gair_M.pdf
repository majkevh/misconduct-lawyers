  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 01-DB-074</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a Petition for Consent Discipline
  (herein "Petition") by the respondent, Gair M. Oldenburg (herein "Respondent"), of Chalmette, Louisiana, after the
  filing of formal charges.&nbsp;</span> The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (herein "ODC") has concurred in
  Respondent's Petition.&nbsp; After reviewing the record and considering the law, the Board accepts the Petition and orders
  a public reprimand be issued against the Respondent in addition to twelve months of probation and other conditions as
  set forth herein.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On July 12, 2001, ODC filed formal charges consisting of two complaints alleging Respondent
  failed to communicate, failed to use reasonable diligence and failed to move litigation forward.&nbsp; After two
  continuances and prior to filing an answer, ODC and Respondent reached an agreement concerning a consent discipline.&nbsp;
  On January 15, 2002, Respondent filed the Petition admitting the alleged misconduct and recommended a public
  reprimand, twelve months of probation, Ethics School and refund unearned fees or participate in the Louisiana State
  Bar Association's alternative dispute resolution program. ODC concurred.&nbsp; A Board panel reviewed the matter on March
  28, 2002.</p>

      <p>You were retained by Ms. Cynthia Anne Schlekau to handle a civil matter for her in 1996. You were retained to

      matter forward. You failed to keep Ms. Schlekau informed about the status of the case, or explain that there were
      procedural problems. You failed to respond to reasonable requests for information from Ms. Schlekau failing to
      adequately respond to phone calls.&nbsp; Your conduct regarding this case has violated Rules

      money from the Coast Guard Employees Credit Union, but failed to timely distribute the assets or provide an

      to respond to reasonable requests for information from Ms. Barbe or Mr. De Armas failing to adequately respond to
      phone calls.&nbsp; The case has not been completed. Due to your failure to communicate with your client, she was
      forced to hire a new attorney, Mr. Donald Wingerter to complete the matter. Ms. Barbe's and Mr. DeArmas' new
      attorney has been unable to communicate with you, or get your cooperation to resolve this matter. Your conduct

  <p class="bodycopy">Petition for Consent Discipline, pgs. 1-2.&nbsp; ODC concurred with the consent discipline.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED SANCTION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Respondent and ODC have conditionally agreed that Respondent has violated Rules 1.3, 1.4 and
  3.2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct.&nbsp; The Board accepts that Respondent has violated these rules.&nbsp;
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96); <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So.2d
  272</a></span>.&nbsp; Given the conditionally tendered violations, the Board is left to determine if the proposed sanction
  is appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board is required to analyze the facts of the consent discipline to determine if the proposed
  sanction is appropriate for the stated misconduct.&nbsp; La. Sp. Ct. R. XIX, &sect;20.&nbsp; The Board must either accept or reject
  the proposed consent discipline.&nbsp; In making the Board's findings, the Louisiana Supreme Court requires the Board to
  consider whether the proposed discipline is appropriate by applying the following criteria:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">La. Sp. Ct. R. XIX, &sect;10(C).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent has negligently violated duties owed to his clients.&nbsp; The heirs in the deArmas matter
  and Ms. Schlekau have been inconvenienced due to the delays in their cases and have had to retain other counsel.&nbsp;
  However, clients' rights and&nbsp; cases were not prejudiced by Respondent's less than diligent actions.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> (herein "Standard") section
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span> provides for a public reprimand when "a lawyer is negligent and does not act
  with reasonable diligence in representing a client, and causes injury or potential injury to a client."&nbsp; In the
  deArmas matter, the facts indicate that Respondent's delay and lack of communication was aggravated by a dispute
  between succession heirs and Respondent's concern about a potential conflict.&nbsp; The record does not indicate that any
  party to the succession was harmed by Respondent's delay.&nbsp; In fact, the succession proceeds were held in Respondent's
  trust account until he deposited them into the court's registry.&nbsp; Stip. Facts pgs. 3-4.&nbsp; In the Schlekau matter,
  Respondent recognized he was at fault for some of the case's delay.&nbsp; However, the Stipulated Facts set forth multiple
  events that added to the case's slow progress:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; difficulty in finding the defendant for service and 2) difficulty
  in getting the client to pay basic costs of litigation.&nbsp; The facts state that Respondent paid for surveillance, long
  distance charges and costs of service and turned over the file with original documents to complainant's new counsel.&nbsp;
  Stip. Facts. p. 4.&nbsp; Both complainants incurred time delays but the record does not indicate any harm or potential
  harm to either.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In the case of <span class="CITE"><i>In re Laiche</i>,
  <a href="1999-07-15_98-DB-057.htm">98-DB-057</a> (Disc. Bd. 7/15/99)</span>, the attorney was publicly reprimanded
  for five counts involving failure to keep his clients informed; failure to diligently move the case along over eight
  years; failure to inform clients of a settlement offer, which he rejected; upon being discharged by his clients, he
  refused to hand over the files and execute a motion to substitute counsel for months; and respondent failed to
  respond to the disciplinary complaint.&nbsp; Based on <i>Laiche</i> and the A.B.A. Standards, the baseline sanction is a
  public reprimand.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The record supports the mitigating factors of:&nbsp; <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest
  or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">personal or emotional problems</span> and
  <span class="ABAstandard">full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward the
  proceedings</span>.&nbsp; The following aggravating factors are found:&nbsp; <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary
  offenses</span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref6">[6]</span></a> and <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience
  in the practice of law</span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" class="fn" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a>.&nbsp;</span> These
  aggravating and mitigating factors balance each other out and Respondent's conduct is not as severe as
  <i>Laiche</i>.&nbsp; The A.B.A. Standards and case law support a public reprimand in this matter.</p>

  <h2><b>RULING</b></h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on the foregoing;</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted, and that respondent,
  Gair M. Oldenburg, receive the following sanction for his violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1.&nbsp; A public reprimand with twelve months of probation.</p>

    <p class="inverted">2.&nbsp; Respondent shall establish and maintain an effective calendaring system and method to

    <p class="inverted">9.&nbsp; Respondent will also respond to all reasonable requests of his probation monitor.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent be assessed all costs and expenses of these proceedings,
  with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this Ruling until paid.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 17B, notice of this
  reprimand shall be published in the journal of the state bar and in a newspaper of general circulation in the parish
