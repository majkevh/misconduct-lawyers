<p class="headingstyle">IN RE: RHEA H. WOODS</p><p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p><p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p><p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of 
Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Rhea H. Woods, a disbarred 
attorney.</p><h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY</h2><p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in Louisiana in 1989. Her first 
disciplinary infraction occurred in 2001, when she was admonished by the disciplinary 
board for failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation.</p><p class="Bodycopy">A far more serious disciplinary proceeding against respondent came before this 
court in 2003. That proceeding involved numerous acts of professional misconduct 
committed by respondent against several different clients beginning in 1995 and 
continuing through 1999. <a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> Among other things, respondent's actions involved three 
instances of conversion of client funds.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Following the filing of formal charges, respondent and the ODC filed a joint 
petition for consent discipline in this court, seeking respondent's disbarment. This 
court granted the petition and disbarred respondent. <span class="cite">In re: Woods, 02-2615 (La. 
1/31/03), <a href="2003-01-31_2002-2615.htm">841 So. 2d 713</a></span> ("Woods I").</p><p class="Bodycopy">Against this backdrop, we now turn to a consideration of the misconduct at 
issue in the present proceeding.</p><h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2><p class="Bodycopy">In November 1998, respondent negotiated a $102,500 settlement on behalf of 
two minors, Brandon Antoine and Brinay Turner, arising out of the wrongful death 
of their mother. Respondent indicated that she would invest the settlement funds for 
the benefit of the minors, but she never obtained a court order authorizing the 
disbursement of the funds. Instead, she retained the funds and converted them to her 
own use.</p><p class="Bodycopy">In March 2002, respondent's clients, through their new attorney, filed a 
complaint against respondent with the ODC. Respondent failed to cooperate with the 
ODC in its investigation of the complaint. The minors' new attorney also filed a 
lawsuit against respondent. In response to the lawsuit, respondent filed bankruptcy, 
listing the minors and their guardians as her only creditors.</p><h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2><p class="Bodycopy">On June 11, 2003, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against 
respondent, alleging that her conduct violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.15(a)</span>(b) (safekeeping property of clients or third persons) and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, 
fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent 
was personally served with the formal charges on June 25, 2003. She failed to answer 
or otherwise reply to the formal charges. Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 
11(E)(3), the factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven 
by clear and convincing evidence. No formal hearing was held, but the parties were 
given an opportunity to file with the hearing committee written arguments and 
documentary evidence on the issue of sanctions. Respondent filed nothing for the 
hearing committee's consideration.</p><h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-01-16_03-DB-033.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3><p class="Bodycopy">Based on the deemed admitted facts, the hearing committee found respondent 
violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.15(a)</span> and (b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged in the formal charges. As to Rule <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span>, the committee made a more generalized finding, 
stating that "[r]espondent violated Rule 8.4 by engaging in conduct that was 
essentially criminal and that reflected adversely on her honesty, trustworthiness and 
fitness as a lawyer."</p><p class="Bodycopy">The committee determined that respondent violated duties owed to her clients 
and the legal profession. Respondent acted intentionally and caused injury to her 
clients. Considering the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the 
baseline sanction is disbarment.</p><p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the committee recognized respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">prior 
disciplinary offenses</span>,<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">a pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the victims</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">indifference 
to making restitution</span>. The committee 
found no mitigating factors.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, the committee recommended respondent be 
disbarred.</p><h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-06-17_03-DB-033.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3><p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board found that the deemed admitted facts in the record 
support the conclusion that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as 
charged in the formal charges. Based on these facts, the board determined that 
respondent violated duties owed to her clients and to the public. It concluded she 
failed to safeguard her clients' settlement funds, failed to maintain her personal 
honesty and integrity and acted intentionally when she converted her clients' 
settlement funds, thus causing them actual harm. Under these circumstances, the 
board concluded the appropriate baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is 
disbarment.</p><p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the board recognized respondent's dishonest or selfish 
motive, a pattern of misconduct, vulnerability of the victims, substantial experience 
in the practice of law, and indifference to making restitution. The board found no 
mitigating factors.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Following the reasoning of this court in <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain, 
<a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 So. 2d 470</a> (La. 1991)</span>, the board observed that the instant misconduct occurred 
within the same time frame as the misconduct at issue in Woods I and therefore, the 
sanction should be determined based on the sanction which would have been imposed 
if both cases had been before the court simultaneously. Had this court considered the 
instant charges together with the charges in Woods I, the board speculated that we may 
have imposed permanent disbarment. In support, the board relied on <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 1</span> of 
the permanent disbarment guidelines found in Supreme Court Rule XIX, Appendix 
E, which provides for permanent disbarment when an attorney engages in "repeated 
or multiple instances of intentional conversion of client funds with substantial harm." 
The board observed that if the conversion of client funds in the instant case had been 
considered together with the three instances of conversion of client funds in Woods 
I, it is likely that this court would have imposed the harsher sanction of permanent 
disbarment.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, the board recommended that respondent be permanently 
disbarred.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's 
recommendation.</p><h2>DISCUSSION</h2><p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. 
Const. art. V, § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an 
independent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has 
been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), 
<a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. 
In the instant matter, respondent did not answer the formal charges. As a result, 
the factual allegations contained within the formal charges were deemed admitted by 
operation of Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). We conclude these deemed 
admitted facts, combined with other evidence in the record, is sufficient to support the 
conclusion that respondent converted and failed to account for client funds in violation 
of Rule 1.15 and engaged in dishonest or fraudulent conduct in violation of Rule 
8.4(c). See <span class="cite">In re: Donnan, 01-3058 (La. 1/10/03), <a href="2003-01-10_2001-3058.htm">838 So. 2d 715</a></span>.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional misconduct, we now turn to consideration of the 
appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct. In determining an appropriate 
sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high 
standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and 
deter future misconduct. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 
1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the 
seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and 
mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> 
(La. 1984)</span>.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's willful conversion of a substantial amount of funds belonging to 
her minor clients, combined with her fraudulent representation that she would invest 
these funds for the benefit of her minor clients, is among the most serious professional 
misconduct a lawyer can commit. The baseline sanction for such misconduct is 
unquestionably disbarment. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Hinrichs, <a href="1986-03-31_1984-1459.htm">486 So. 2d 116</a> 
(La. 1986)</span>.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Nonetheless, the disciplinary board urges that we not consider the instant 
misconduct in isolation, but address it in conjunction with the misconduct in Woods 
I, which occurred within the same general time frame. The concept of simultaneously 
considering prior misconduct with new charges based on conduct occurring at the 
same time as earlier misconduct originated in our opinion in Louisiana State Bar 
Ass'n v. Chatelain, 573 So. 2d 470, 471 n. 2 (La. 1991), in which we explained:</p><blockquote>

<p>Since the attorney-respondent cannot control the timing of 
the institution of disciplinary proceedings, it is generally 
inappropriate to disbar a previously disbarred attorney an 
additional time when the violations at issue occurred before 
or concurrently with the violations which resulted in the 
initial disbarment. When a second disciplinary proceeding 
against an attorney involves misconduct which occurred 
during the same time period as the first proceeding, the 
overall discipline to be imposed should be determined as if 
both proceedings were before the court simultaneously. See 
1 Lawyers' Manual on Professional Conduct 466 (1984); 
Matter of Thompson, 492 A.2d 866 (D.C.App. 1985).</p></blockquote>


<p class="Bodycopy">In Chatelain, we were concerned that it would be potentially unfair for a lawyer to receive a greater sanction simply because of the timing of the prosecution. However, as the jurisprudence has evolved, we have also recognized that the lawyer should not benefit in cases where it 
is obvious the cumulative effect of the newly-charged misconduct and the prior misconduct would have caused us to impose a greater sanction had we been aware of that misconduct at the time we rendered our initial judgment. See, e.g., <span class="cite">In re: Holley, 03-1366 (La. 10/3/03),
<a href="2003-10-03_2003-1366.htm">856 So. 2d 1197</a></span> 
("[h]ad we considered the instant misconduct together with the misconduct in Holley 
I, it is likely we would have imposed a more severe sanction, probably in the range of 
eighteen months, with some period of deferral and probation."). In short, our 
overriding consideration has been to determine the appropriate overall sanction for the 
lawyer's misconduct, ignoring any distortions which may be caused by the timing of 
the filing of formal charges.</p><p class="Bodycopy">Applying that reasoning to the matter sub judice, we recognize that the instant 
charge, based on misconduct which occurred in 1998, is part of the continuing series 
of professional breaches by respondent spanning the period between 1995-1999, 
which we first addressed in Woods I. To consider this charge in isolation from the 
similar charges in Woods I would prevent us from recognizing respondent's pattern 
of serious misconduct. Accordingly, we find it appropriate to consider the instant 
charges together with the charges at issue in Woods I and determine an appropriate 
sanction as if both cases were before the court simultaneously.</p><p class="Bodycopy">In Woods I, we found respondent engaged in three instances of conversion, in 
the amount of $30,000, $52,000 and $38,000. The sole mitigating factors were partial 
restitution and personal problems during the time of the misconduct.</p><p class="Bodycopy">In the instant proceeding, the amount of funds converted (in excess of 
$100,000) is much greater than the funds converted from any single client in Woods 
I. The present victims are in a more vulnerable position than the victims in Woods 
I, as the victims in the instant case are minors deprived of a recovery stemming from 
the wrongful death of their mother. Respondent has not made any effort at restitution; 
to the contrary, she has sought bankruptcy protection in an effort to shield herself 
from the payment of restitution.</p><p class="Bodycopy">In Appendix E to Supreme Court Rule XIX, we set forth guidelines illustrating 
the types of conduct which might warrant permanent disbarment. Guideline 1 applies 
to "repeated or multiple instances of intentional conversion of client funds with 
substantial harm." The instant charge of conversion combined with the three prior 
instances of conversion demonstrates respondent willfully engaged in repeated or 
multiple instances of conversion of client funds resulting in substantial harm to her 
clients. While all instances of conversion are serious, respondent's calculated decision 
to victimize her minor clients by converting funds recovered based on their mother's 
wrongful death is particularly reprehensible and demonstrates a clear lack of moral 
fitness on the part of respondent. Had we been aware of the instant misconduct at the 
time we considered Woods I, we would have imposed permanent disbarment.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a></p><p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board's recommendation and 
permanently disbar respondent from the practice of law in Louisiana.</p>

<h2>DECREE</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee 
and disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that the name of Rhea 
H. Woods, Louisiana Bar Roll number 19840, be stricken from the roll of attorneys 
and that her license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked. Pursuant to 
Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered that respondent be 
permanently prohibited from being readmitted to the practice of law in this state. 
Respondent is ordered to provide complete accountings and full restitution to her 
victims. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in 
accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence 
thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1">1</a> The misconduct forming the basis for the instant proceeding arose during this same general 
time frame, as will be discussed in more detail later in our opinion.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2">2</a> As stated earlier, in addition to her disbarment in Woods I, respondent was also 
admonished by the disciplinary board in 2001 for failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3">3</a> Because Woods I arose as a petition for consent discipline, we would have rejected that 
petition as unduly lenient, with the clear implication that permanent disbarment was the appropriate 
sanction.</p>
