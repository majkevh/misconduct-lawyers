<p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-1463</p>
<p class="headingstyle">IN RE: CLAYTON PAUL SCHNYDER</p>
<p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from two sets of formal 
charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, 
Clayton Paul Schnyder, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>
<h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">The first set of formal charges, consisting of one count and 
bearing the disciplinary board's docket number 02-DB-129, was filed on December 
11, 2002. The second set of formal charges, consisting of one count and bearing 
the disciplinary board's docket number 03-DB-064, was filed on September 25, 
2003. The two sets were consolidated by order of the hearing committee chair 
dated October 14, 2003.</p>
<h3>02-DB-129</h3>
<h4>The Ceasor Matter</h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">In November 1999, Kewana Ceasor hired respondent to handle a 
personal injury matter on a contingency basis. Thereafter, respondent failed to 
diligently pursue the matter. More specifically, he failed to obtain a 
settlement or timely file suit on his client's behalf. Additionally, respondent 
failed to communicate with Ms. Ceasor about the status of the matter. Several 
times, respondent told Ms. Ceasor he would call her back after reviewing the 
file, but he failed to do so. He also did not inform her that he failed to 
timely file suit.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In January 2002, Ms. Ceasor filed a disciplinary complaint 
against respondent because of her inability to obtain information from him. 
Despite receiving notice of the complaint, respondent did not reply to the ODC's 
request for information, necessitating the ODC to issue a subpoena in order to 
obtain his sworn statement. During the sworn statement, respondent admitted that 
suit was not timely filed.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges respondent's conduct in this matter violated 
Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable 
diligence and promptness in representing a client), <span class="allegedrules">
1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a client), <span class="allegedrules">
3.2</span> (failure to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation), and
<span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in 
its investigation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<h3>03-DB-064</h3>
<h4>The Magee Matter</h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">In 1998, Veronica Magee hired respondent to assist her in 
pursuing an insurance claim following the collapse of her roof. After being 
retained, respondent failed to answer Ms. Magee's telephone calls. Because she 
was unable to obtain information about her case, Ms. Magee eventually retained 
new counsel.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In addition to the insurance matter, respondent also 
represented Ms. Magee in two other legal matters. One of these matters involved 
a lawsuit arising out of an automobile accident, in which Ms. Magee was the 
defendant. On the day the case was set for trial, Ms. Magee's sister was killed. 
Ms. Magee informed respondent she would not be able to attend the trial. 
However, respondent failed to file for a continuance or appear at the trial on 
his client's behalf, resulting in judgment being rendered against Ms. Magee.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In the other matter, respondent represented Ms. Magee in a 
civil suit filed against a restaurant based on a claim that her car was stolen 
from the restaurant's valet parking. Respondent obtained a default judgment for 
$46,000. However, the defendants moved for and obtained a new trial. Following 
the grant of the new trial, defendants propounded discovery on Ms. Magee through 
respondent. When no discovery responses were filed, defendants filed a motion to 
compel together with a motion to dismiss. The court granted respondent 
additional time to respond to the discovery, but he failed to do so. As a 
result, the defendants filed a second motion to dismiss.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Prior to a ruling on the motion to dismiss, respondent and 
defendants entered into a settlement in the amount of $3,000. Ms. Magee was not 
present for the settlement and contends she did not authorize respondent to 
enter into same. Although Ms. Magee refused to accept the settlement funds from 
respondent, defendants filed a motion to enforce the settlement, which the trial 
court granted. The ODC alleges respondent's conduct in this matter violated 
Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.2(a)</span> (scope of the representation), 
1.3, and 1.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to both sets 
of formal charges. Accordingly, the factual allegations contained therein were 
deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme 
Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). No formal hearing was held, but the parties were 
given an opportunity to file with the hearing committee written arguments and 
documentary evidence on the issue of sanctions. Respondent filed nothing for the 
hearing committee's consideration.</p>
<h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-12-13_02-DB-129.htm">Hearing 
Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After considering the ODC's submissions in response to the 
deemed admitted order, the hearing committee found the documentary evidence 
presented by the ODC to be clear and convincing. The committee also determined 
the factual allegations in the formal charges to be essentially true and correct 
findings of fact. Based on these findings, the committee determined that 
respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal 
charges.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The committee determined that in the Caesor and Magee 
matters, respondent failed to use reasonable diligence in pursuing the legal 
matters entrusted to him and failed to expedite the litigation. In the Magee 
matter, it found he failed to expedite litigation consistent with the interests 
of his client. Finally, it concluded respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC 
in its investigation.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The committee determined that respondent violated duties 
owed to his clients and as a professional. He acted negligently and knowingly, 
causing significant harm to both clients, which could have been avoided. As 
aggravating factors, it found <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary 
offenses</span> <a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> and
<span class="ABAstandard">bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding 
by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary 
agency</span>. The committee found no mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering these findings, the committee recommended that 
respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year and six months. 
The committee further recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs of 
these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the 
hearing committee's recommendation.</p>
<h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2005-05-31_02-DB-129.htm">Disciplinary 
Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing this matter, the disciplinary board found 
that the factual allegations alleged in the formal charges were proven by clear 
and convincing evidence. Based upon these proven facts, the board determined 
that the hearing committee correctly concluded respondent violated the Rules of 
Professional Conduct as charged.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on a review of the record, the board found that 
respondent negligently and knowingly violated duties owed to his clients and as 
a professional. His conduct caused significant harm to his clients and actual 
harm to the profession. The board adopted the aggravating factors found by the 
committee and also found the mitigating factor of inexperience in the practice 
of law, as respondent had been admitted less than five years during the period 
when most of the misconduct occurred. Relying on the ABA's Standards for 
Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the board determined the baseline sanction for 
respondent's misconduct is suspension or disbarment.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The board acknowledged that the sanction recommended by the 
committee is within the range of the ABA's guidelines for similar misconduct. 
However, the board determined that the facts and circumstances of this matter, 
as well as prior jurisprudence,<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> 
suggest an eighteen-month suspension may be too harsh for respondent's 
misconduct. Accordingly, the board recommended respondent be suspended from the 
practice of law for one year and one day. The board further recommended that 
respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">One board member dissented. The dissenting member concluded 
that because the hearing committee's recommendation was within the range of 
acceptable sanctions, the board should not have intervened absent an objection 
from ODC or respondent. Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the 
disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters fall within the original 
jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V, § 5(B). Consequently, we act as 
triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine 
whether the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence.
<span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94),
<a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">
Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 
2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In cases in which the lawyer does not answer the formal 
charges, the factual allegations of those charges are deemed admitted. Supreme 
Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). Thus, the ODC bears no additional burden to prove 
the factual allegations contained in the formal charges after those charges have 
been deemed admitted. However, the language of § 11(E)(3) does not encompass 
legal conclusions that flow from the factual allegations. If the legal 
conclusion the ODC seeks to prove (i.e., a violation of a specific rule) is not 
readily apparent from the deemed admitted facts, additional evidence may need to 
be submitted in order to prove the legal conclusions that flow from the admitted 
factual allegations. <span class="cite">In re: Donnan, 01-3058 (La. 1/10/03),
<a href="2003-01-10_2001-3058.htm">838 So. 2d 715</a></span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on our independent review of the record, we conclude 
the deemed admitted facts, together with the other evidence in the record, 
supports the conclusion that respondent violated the Rules of Professional 
Conduct as charged. In both the Ceasor and Magee matters, respondent failed to 
communicate with his clients and neglected their legal matters. In the Magee 
matter, he settled his client's lawsuit without her consent or knowledge. 
Additionally, respondent failed to cooperate in the ODC's investigation into 
these matters.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional misconduct, the sole issue 
presented for our consideration is the appropriate sanction. In determining a 
sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain 
high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the 
profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar 
Ass'n v. Reis, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. 
The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the 
seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and 
mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. 
Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>. 
Respondent violated duties owed to his clients and as a professional. Although 
most of his misconduct appears to be a result of negligence, his decision to 
settle his client's suit in the Magee matter was at least knowing and most 
likely intentional misconduct. In all events, his actions caused actual and 
substantial harm to his clients.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Several aggravating factors are present, including prior 
disciplinary offenses, a pattern of misconduct, and bad faith obstruction of the 
disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders 
of the disciplinary agency. As a mitigating factor, we recognize respondent's 
relative inexperience in the practice of law at the time most of the misconduct 
occurred.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As the board observed, the applicable ABA Standard supports 
a range of discipline from suspension to disbarment for the misconduct at issue 
in this case. Typically, this court has imposed suspensions of one year and one 
day for similar misconduct, on the theory that such a suspension will 
necessitate an application for reinstatement and require the attorney to 
demonstrate he or she has taken steps to address his or her ethical lapse . See, 
e.g., <span class="cite">In re: Dunn, 02-2165 (La. 11/8/02),
<a href="2002-11-08_2002-2165.htm">831 So. 2d 889</a></span> (lawyer suspended 
for one year and one day for neglecting two legal matters, failing to 
communicate with three clients, failing to promptly refund unearned fees, and 
failing to cooperate with the ODC), and <span class="cite">In re: Smith, 00-2627 
(La. 11/27/00), <a href="2000-11-27_2000-2627.htm">775 So. 2d 1</a></span> 
(lawyer suspended for one year and one day for neglecting two legal matters, 
failing to communicate with his clients, failing to refund unearned fees, 
attempting to practice while ineligible to do so, and failing to cooperate with 
the ODC).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering that respondent's conduct was largely negligent 
and occurred during a time when he was relatively inexperienced in the practice 
of law, a harsher sanction is not warranted in this case. We conclude that a one 
year and one day suspension will serve the dual function of protecting the 
public and deterring future misconduct by respondent. See <span class="cite">In 
re: Blanson, 01-3048 (La. 2/22/02), <a href="2002-02-22_2001-3048.htm">809 So. 
2d 126</a></span>. Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board's 
recommendation and suspend respondent from the practice of law for one year and 
one day.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the 
hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is 
ordered that Clayton Paul Schnyder, Louisiana Bar Roll number 24212, be and he 
hereby is suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year and one 
day. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in 
accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence 
thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
