  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">No. 98-B-0535</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: WOODY MARVIN DUNN</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM. (<a href="#fn_" name="fnref_" id="fnref_">FN*</a>)</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Woody Marvin Dunn, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State
  of Louisiana.  The charges allege respondent allowed his client's claim to be dismissed on grounds of abandonment,
  and that he became involved in a conflict of interest by attempting to monetarily settle his liability with his
  client, in violation of Rules 1.1 (lack of competence); 1.3 (lack of due diligence); 1.4 (failure to comply with
  reasonable requests for information); 1.8(h) (making an agreement limiting the lawyer's liability for malpractice);
  8.4(a) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving fraud, deceit, dishonesty
  or misrepresentation); and 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial  to the administration of justice) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The record indicates that Tina M. Rizzutto retained respondent to pursue a personal injury case
  on her behalf arising out of a vehicular accident.  While respondent timely filed suit on Mrs. Rizzutto's behalf, he
  failed to actively pursue the case for over five years, ultimately resulting in a dismissal of the suit on grounds of
  abandonment. <a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">FN1</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After Mrs. Rizzutto advised respondent of the dismissal of her law suit, he acknowledged his
  error and offered to settle with her for the amount of $4,500.  However, he did not advise his client to seek advice
  from independent counsel on the settlement.  Shortly thereafter, the respondent forwarded a check to his client in
  the amount of $1,500. <a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">FN2</a></p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, Mrs. Rizzutto filed a complaint with the ODC, as well as a legal malpractice suit,
  against respondent.  Three months later, respondent paid the balance of the settlement amount along with attorneys
  fees, resulting in the dismissal of the malpractice suit.  After the ODC instituted formal charges, respondent
  answered, conceding he negligently permitted his client's suit to be dismissed, but denying his actions were
  unethical.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee conducted a formal hearing.  Mrs. Rizzutto testified she did not think
  respondent tried to cheat her when he offered to settle his liability.  Mrs. Rizzutto's husband testified that
  respondent had provided satisfactory legal services for him in the past and seemingly made a simple mistake in the
  personal injury suit involving his wife.  The respondent testified on his own behalf, alleging Mrs. Rizzutto's case
  was the first he had involving an insurance company in receivership, causing him to have to deal with the Louisiana
  Insurance Guaranty Association ("LIGA").  He testified it was a frustrating process because he was unable to locate
  the person handling his client's claim who was in a position to settle the case.  Respondent introduced one letter
  into evidence indicating he had in fact sent medical information to LIGA and attempted to settle the case.  Further,
  he testified he communicated with his client prior to the dismissal of the case.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing committee filed its report with the disciplinary
  board.  In its report, the hearing committee found that respondent demonstrated a lack of diligence, resulting in his
  client's  case being dismissed as abandoned.  However, as to respondent's subsequent settlement with his client, the
  committee determined there was no evidence respondent used his "superior" position to take advantage of his client
  when he entered into the contract with her.  Although it recognized respondent did not advise his client to seek
  independent counsel, the committee noted respondent's conduct "was intended to be fair and reasonable and he was not
  attempting to exploit his representation of the client."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Relying on the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the committee noted the baseline
  sanction for respondent's conduct ranged from admonition to reprimand. <a class="fn" href="#fn3" name="fnref3"
  id="fnref3">FN3</a> As factors in aggravation, the committee recognized respondent's experience in the practice of
  law and the fact the suit became abandoned over a five year period.  As mitigating factors, the committee recognized
  respondent's personal problems, acknowledgment of his error, his immediate attempt to make his client whole and
  candor with his client.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these factors, the committee determined the appropriate discipline in this case would be
  admonition.  However, since an admonition may not be imposed once formal charges are filed, <a name="fnref4"
  class="fn" href="#fn4" id="fnref4">FN4</a> the committee ultimately declined to impose any sanction on
  respondent.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed an objection with the disciplinary board to the committee's failure to impose any
  sanction.<br />
   Thereafter, the disciplinary board issued its recommendations to this court.  The board stated it was "concerned
  that Respondent settled a malpractice claim without advising his client to seek independent counsel, which is a
  conflict of interest regardless of how fair the settlement appears to be."  Thus, it concluded the committee erred in
  finding respondent's conduct with regard to the settlement did not constitute a violation of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct. <a class="fn" href="#fn5" name="fnref5" id="fnref5">FN5</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Relying on Standards 4.32 <a name="fnref6" class="fn" href="#fn6" id="fnref6">FN6</a> and 4.42
  <a name="fnref7" class="fn" href="#fn7" id="fnref7">FN7</a> of the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the
  board concluded suspension was the baseline sanction.  It adopted the mitigating and aggravating factors cited by the
  hearing committee, and noted the presence of additional aggravating factors: <span class="ABAstandard">prior
  discipline</span>, (<a name="fnref8" class="fn" href="#fn8" id="fnref8">FN8</a>) <span class="ABAstandard">selfish
  motive</span> (settling matter without referring the client to independent counsel),
  <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of conduct</span> (in allowing the matter to take five years) and
  <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the victim</span>.  Nonetheless, the board concluded respondent was
  "basically an honest person" and believed that the conduct would not occur again.  Based on all these factors, the
  board recommended respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months, with this suspension
  totally deferred, conditioned upon successful completion of a one year probationary period with a practice monitor to
  periodically review respondent's case files.  It further recommended respondent be assessed with proceeding
  costs.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an objection in this court to the disciplinary board's proposed sanction, and
  the matter was docketed for oral argument pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, s 11(G)(1)(b).</p>

  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the facts of this matter, we conclude the sanction recommended by the disciplinary board
  is appropriate.  While respondent's failure to advise his client to retain independent counsel prior to entering into
  the settlement is clearly a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the hearing committee made a finding of
  fact, which is supported by the record, that respondent intended to be fair and reasonable and he was not attempting
  to exploit his representation of the client.  Under such circumstances, a period of deferred suspension, subject to a
  probationary period, is an adequate sanction.  <span class="CITE">In re Kevin Thompson, 98-0079 (La.5/8/98),
  <a href="1998-05-08_1998-0079.htm">712 So.2d 72</a>.</span></p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the
  <span class="CITE"><a href="../HC/1997-05-01_96-DB-083.htm">hearing committee</a></span> and disciplinary board, and
  considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is the decision of this court that the recommendation of the
  disciplinary board be adopted.  Accordingly, it is ordered that respondent, Woody Marvin Dunn, be suspended from the
  practice of law for a period of six months, deferred, subject to a one year probationary period under the conditions
  recommended by the disciplinary board.  Costs in the amount of $788.80 are assessed against respondent.</p>

  <p class="footnote"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">FN1</a>. Respondent was apparently unaware that
  his client's suit was dismissed because, while representing his client's husband, Joseph Rizzutto, in an unrelated
  domestic matter, respondent advised he was still trying to settle Mrs. Rizzutto's personal injury case.</p>

  <p class="footnote"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">FN2</a>. Respondent alleges that due to economic
  and personal problems, he did not have sufficient funds to finance the balance of the settlement at that time.</p>

  <p class="footnote"><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3" id="fn3">FN3</a>. The committee relied on ABA Standards
  4.3, 4.3 and 4.34.  Standard 4.3 provides a reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent in
  determining whether the representation of a client may be materially affected by the lawyer's own interest.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnote">Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.4</span> provides a reprimand is appropriate "when an
    attorney is negligent or does not act with reasonable diligence in representing a client that causes injury or
    potential injury to a client."  It further provides an "admonition is generally appropriate when a lawyer is
    negligent or does not act with reasonable diligence in representing a client and causes little or no actual damage
    or potential injury to a client."</p>

    <p class="footnote">Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.34</span> provides admonition is "generally appropriate
    when a lawyer engages in an isolated incident of negligence in determining whether representation of a client may
    be materially affected by the lawyer's own interest."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="footnote"><a name="fn4" class="fn" href="#fnref4" id="fn4">FN4</a>. See Supreme Court Rule XIX, s 10(A)(4),

  <p class="footnote"><a name="fn5" class="fn" href="#fnref5" id="fn5">FN5</a>. Citing Rule 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct
  prejudicial to the administration of justice), the board stated "the settling of a malpractice case with a client
  without advising the client to seek independent counsel is prejudicial to the administration of justice and strikes
  at the heart of the prohibition</p>

  <p class="footnote"><a name="fn6" class="fn" href="#fnref6" id="fn6">FN6</a>. ABA Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.32</span> suggests suspension is "appropriate when a lawyer knows of a conflict of

  injury to a client."</p>

  <p class="footnote"><a name="fn7" class="fn" href="#fnref7" id="fn7">FN7</a>. ABA Standard
