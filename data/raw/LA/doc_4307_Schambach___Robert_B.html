NO. 99-B-2432<br>
IN RE:&nbsp; ROBERT B. SCHAMBACH</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>ATTORNEY DISCIPINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'><font size="3">PER CURIAM</font></p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from formal charges instituted by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) against respondent, Robert B. Schambach, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana, who is currently suspended from practice in an unrelated matter.</font><span class="CITE"><font size="1"> 1</font></span></p>
<p><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Complainant, Dianna Womble, first retained respondent in 1985 in connection with litigation involving a trust.&nbsp; Respondent successfully handled the matter. </font></p>
<p><font size="3"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over the next several years, respondent and Ms. Womble became personal friends.&nbsp; He advised her in several other legal matters, including a succession proceeding and the sale of immovable property.&nbsp; Sometime around 1990, respondent began engaging in an extra-marital affair with Ms. Womble.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1991, respondent borrowed $30,000 and $10,000 from Ms. Womble,</font><span class="CITE"><font size="1"> 2</font><font size="3"> </font></span> and gave her a promissory note in the amount of $44,000.&nbsp; Ms. Womble sought repayment on the promissory note in 1992; however, due to financial problems in his solo legal practice, respondent was unable to pay her back.&nbsp; By 1993, the personal relationship between Ms. Womble and respondent deteriorated, and she ultimately filed suit against him and his wife in an attempt to recover on the promissory note.<span class="CITE"><font size="1"> 3</font></span></p>
<p><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1996, Ms. Womble filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC, stating that although she was disabled from working and had virtually no funds to live on, respondent refused to pay her back.&nbsp; While he agreed to pay her living expenses after she had filed suit against him, he let her health insurance lapse, and on two occasions her electricity, telephone and water were turned off.&nbsp; When she returned to work in January of 1994, she was forced to file for bankruptcy.</font><span class="CITE"><font size="1">4</font><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></span>Ms. Womble contended the respondent took advantage of his position as her attorney by luring her into an illicit sexual affair during a vulnerable period in her life and borrowing over $40,000 in funds and failing to repay her.</p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After an investigation, the ODC instituted formal charges against respondent, primarily alleging his conduct amounted to a conflict of interest, in violation of </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.7'></a><font size="3"> of the Rules of Professional Conduct,</font><font size="1"> </font><span class="CITE">5</span><font size="3">&nbsp; and a prohibited business transaction with a client, in violation of </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.8'></a><font size="3"> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</font><font size="1"> </font><span class="CITE">6<font size="3"> </font></span> Additionally, the ODC alleged respondent failed to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation, in violation of Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a><font size="3">(g).</font><font size="1"> </font><span class="CITE">7</span><p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondent failed to file an answer.&nbsp; However, he later filed a motion seeking a hearing for the purpose of offering evidence in mitigation.&nbsp; That motion was granted, and a hearing was held before the committee on the issue of mitigation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the hearing, Ms. Womble testified respondent had assisted her in most of her legal and personal matters.&nbsp; She stated she was satisfied with the respondent's legal representation, and testified their sexual relationship was both mutual and consensual.&nbsp; According to Ms. Womble, she loaned respondent money based on their friendship and not because he was her attorney.&nbsp; She stated she did not think he intended to steal the funds, and that he did intend to pay her back.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Edward Shwery, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, testified he saw respondent for the first time one month before the hearing.&nbsp; He characterized respondent as being psychologically immature and suffering from chronic anxiety and depression, which developed during the ten years prior to the incident in question.&nbsp; Dr. Shwery further testified that respondent utilized the defense mechanism of denial, which he explained as being like &quot;sticking one's head in the sand&quot; when confronted with problems.&nbsp; For example, when several prior disciplinary complaints were filed against respondent, his response was to close his law practice.</font><font size="1"> </font><span class="CITE">8<font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></span>Rather than seeking counseling when he had marital problems, he engaged in an affair with Ms. Womble.&nbsp; Although respondent sought treatment with a psychiatrist for a short period of time in 1993, he stopped because he thought he had his problems under control.&nbsp; Dr. Shwery felt respondent's clinical problems worsened in the summer of 1997 due to a series of personal tragedies that &quot;overwhelmed&quot; his defenses.&nbsp; These included the recent deaths of five family members and a divorce from his wife.&nbsp; Respondent again sought treatment with a psychiatrist and a social worker.&nbsp; Dr. Shwery testified respondent's actions were never deceitful or calculating, and that respondent's prognosis, in terms of functioning as a lawyer, was quite good if he remained in treatment.</p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondent testified on his own behalf.&nbsp; Respondent indicated he was admitted to practice in 1976.&nbsp; He was currently suspended from the practice of law, but he had not sought reinstatement despite his eligibility.&nbsp; Respondent testified he borrowed the funds from Ms. Womble to keep his law practice operating, but </font></p>
<p><font size="3">he ultimately failed and had to file for bankruptcy.&nbsp; Respondent stated he continues to seek treatment, and indicated he paid restitution after borrowing the funds from his family, which he asserted he would have paid back regardless of the outcome of this proceeding.</font></p>
<p><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Adc3d?an=JD_HC9701 --##'><b>Hearing Committee Recommendation</b></a><b></b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hearing committee found respondent acted wrongfully in having a sexual affair with his client and in entering into a business transaction with her.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The committee found the relationship between Ms. Womble and respondent was more personal than professional, but concluded this did not excuse the respondent's actions.&nbsp; The hearing committee expressed concern as to whether the respondent was remorseful since he made no effort to provide restitution until the eve of the committee hearing.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Based on these findings, the committee recommended respondent be suspended for a period of eighteen months, commencing on April 15, 1998, the date of the hearing.&nbsp; During that time, the committee recommended respondent undergo psychological counseling/therapy, with quarterly reports provided to the ODC.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="3">At the end of the period of suspension, and upon recommendation of respondent's therapist, respondent could apply for readmission, subject to a two year period of probation with conditions</font><span class="CITE">.<font size="1"> 9</font></span></p>
<p><b>Disciplinary Board Recommendation</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Based on the record, the disciplinary board agreed that respondent's relationship with Ms. Womble was principally personal and not professional.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Citing </font><span class="CITE"><font size="3"><b><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Bosworth</i></b></font><font size="3">, 481 So.2d 567 (La.1987)</font></span>,<span class="CITE"><font size="1"> 10</font></span></p>
<p><font size="3">the board also recognized the loans were based on a friendship, and did not stem exclusively from the attorney-client relationship.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In mitigation, the board noted respondent had not applied for readmission from his prior suspension at the time the instant formal charges were filed.&nbsp; Moreover, it recognized respondent had a history of clinical depression and treatment, </font></p>
<p><font size="3">and he suffered tremendous personal loss in his family.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Based on these considerations, the board recommended respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year for the instant offenses.&nbsp; Given the fact that respondent was currently suspended, it determined this sanction would be </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">roughly equal to that recommended by the committee, since respondent could reapply for readmission on both suspensions in one proceeding.</font><span class="CITE"><font face='Times New Roman' size="1">11</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; </font></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The board further recommended that as a condition precedent to readmission, respondent must provide proof that he is continuing therapy for chronic anxiety and clinical depression.</p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One board member concurred, stating respondent should provide proof upon reinstatement of successful continuing treatment.&nbsp; Another member concurred, indicating a more severe sanction would have been appropriate if the sexual relationship had not been mutual and consensual between the parties.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ODC filed an objection to the board's recommendation.&nbsp; Pursuant to </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s11'></a><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> the matter was set on this court's docket for oral argument.</font></p>
<p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the time of their recommendations, neither the hearing committee nor the disciplinary board had the benefit of our opinion in </font><span class="CITE"><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b><i>In Re: Ashy</i></b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">, 98-0662 </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">(La.12/1/98), --- So.2d ----</font></span>. <span class="CITE">In <font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b><i>Ashy</i></b></font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">, we imposed a two year suspension on an </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">attorney who attempted to develop a sexual relationship with a female client in exchange for making certain efforts on her behalf as her lawyer.&nbsp; We found that although sexual relations or sexual misconduct with a client was not specifically addressed in the present Rules of Professional Conduct, such conduct could violate several existing rules.&nbsp; For example, applying </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.7'></a><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">(b), we found sexual harassment of a client could adversely affect the quality of representation by undermining the client's trust in the attorney.&nbsp; </font><p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Likewise, applying </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE2.1'></a><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">, we found a sexual relationship could impair the lawyer's objectivity and independent professional judgment.</font><p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although the instant case, involving a consensual relationship, is distinguishable in some ways from </font><span class="CITE"><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b><i>Ashy</i></b></font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">, we find that respondent violated the </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Rules of Professional Conduct by allowing his personal relationship with Ms. </font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Womble to interfere with his professional responsibilities toward her.&nbsp; During his on-going representation of Ms. Womble, respondent borrowed a substantial sum of money (originating from funds he had previously recovered on her behalf as her attorney) from her when he knew she was disabled and in a vulnerable </font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">position.&nbsp; He then discharged this debt in bankruptcy, leaving Ms. Womble with virtually no funds for her living expenses and forcing her to file for bankruptcy.&nbsp; Respondent made no effort to make restitution to Ms. Womble until the eve of the disciplinary hearing in this case.&nbsp; Although we recognize that Ms. Womble ultimately testified on respondent's behalf at the hearing, the marked change in her testimony from statements in her earlier complaint, especially in light of respondent's payment of restitution, calls into question the credibility of her hearing testimony.&nbsp; Taken as a whole, we find the record supports the conclusion that respondent violated his duties to Ms. Womble, and this violation resulted in serious harm to her.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Considering all these factors, we conclude a three year suspension from the practice of law is an appropriate sanction in this case.</font></p>
<p><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, briefs and oral argument, it is the decision of the court that respondent, Robert B. Schambach, be </font>suspended<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> from the practice of law for a period of </font>three years<font face='Times New Roman' size="3">, said suspension to commence from the finality of this judgment.&nbsp; Respondent is assessed with all costs and expenses of this proceeding in accordance with </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s10'></a></p>
