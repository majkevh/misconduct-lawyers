  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: GILDA R. SMALL</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary proceeding involves four counts of misconduct filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Gilda R. Small, an attorney licensed to practice law in
  Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <h3>General Background Facts</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">After being admitted to the bar in 1983, respondent operated a solo practice.  In late 1990, she
  became associated with the law office of attorney Janice Clark (hereinafter referred to as "Clark firm").  In the
  summer of 1992, Ms. Clark began campaigning for a judgeship.  During the time Ms. Clark campaigned for office,
  respondent operated the Clark firm by herself.  Ms. Clark won the election, took her oath of office in October 1992,
  and began her term on January 1, 1993.  Respondent entered into a verbal agreement with her, whereby respondent would
  remain in the Clark firm's office and take over the firm's pending cases.  Dele Adebamiji, another Louisiana
  attorney, was also hired to assist in the disposition of the pending cases.  Respondent remained with the Clark firm
  until July 1994.  The disciplinary complaints subject of these proceedings involve those cases handled by respondent
  during her tenure with the Clark firm.</p>

  <h3>Count I - Blakes Matter</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Lawrence Blakes was involved in an accident on December 23, 1992.  According to Mr. Blakes, he
  went to the office of the Clark firm and met respondent, who advised him that she was handling his personal injury
  matter.  At that time, he executed an employment agreement with respondent<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and provided her documentation.  Mr. Blakes maintains respondent neglected to ever
  contact him again. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">By contrast,  respondent  asserts Mr. Blakes' personal injury matter was on a list of cases left
  for her to take over following Judge Clark's election.  Respondent denies she ever met Mr. Blakes prior to January
  1994, more than one year after she took over the case at the request of Judge Clark, at which time he allegedly came
  to her office at her direction to execute pleadings relative to his pauper status.  She asserts she advised him at
  that time that she would be co-counsel with Mr. Adebamiji on the case.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In any event, it is undisputed respondent failed to adequately communicate with Mr. Blakes and
  neglected to take any formal action in the case until January 1994, more than one year after the accident, when she
  filed an untimely suit on her client's behalf against the tortfeasor and two insurance carriers.<a href="#_ftn2"
  name="_ftnref2" class="fn" id="_ftnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>Thereafter, Mr. Blakes made numerous efforts to contact
  respondent, but was unable to reach her.  Ultimately, Mr. Blakes was forced to retain new counsel. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In September 1994, Mr. Blakes filed a complaint with the ODC.  Several months later, respondent
  replied to the complaint alleging she relocated her office and did not have the financial means to send written
  notice of her relocation to her clients, including Mr. Blakes.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

  <h3>  Count II - Square Matter</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In July 1993, Fannie Square retained respondent to institute succession proceedings, paying
  respondent a  total of $575.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" class="fn" id="_ftnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>Five months
  later, respondent had not filed suit on behalf of her client.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In December 1993, Ms. Square filed a complaint with the ODC, alleging respondent refused to
  communicate with her and seeking a return of the unearned fee.  Six months later, respondent replied to the
  complaint, alleging she had drafted the succession pleadings, but had not filed them because her client owed
  additional court costs for the filing.  Respondent advised the ODC that she would return her client's file and
  money.  Thereafter, respondent failed to return her client's property, and did not take any measures to file the
  suit.</p>

  <h3>Count III - Moore Matter</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In August 1992, Ralph and Creola Moore retained respondent for $410 to represent their interests
  in amicable custody proceedings.  The Moores were seeking custody of Mr. Moore's son from a prior marriage. 
  Respondent drafted the necessary pleadings and advised Mrs. Moore the pleadings had been filed. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">More than one year later, Mrs. Moore learned the pleadings had never been filed.  Upon being
  confronted with this fact, respondent agreed to provide restitution.  However, she failed to do so and failed to
  communicate with her client.  During this time, Mr. Moore died of leukemia, leaving the custody mater
  unresolved. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Mrs. Moore filed a complaint with the ODC.  Respondent filed a response admitting that some of
  the funds were owed to her client, but that she had been unable to make payment due to financial problems. 
  Respondent has made no efforts at restitution.</p>

  <h3>Count IV - Thomas Matter</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In September 1992, Geraldine Thomas retained respondent for $625 to represent her in divorce
  proceedings.  Although respondent drafted the divorce pleadings, she neglected to have Mrs. Thomas' husband served. 
  Four years after Mrs. Thomas retained respondent, respondent had not performed the work for which she had been
  retained, nor did she return the unearned fee to Mrs. Thomas.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In June 1996, Mrs. Thomas filed a complaint with the ODC.  Respondent replied to the complaint,
  denying any misconduct on her part and claiming she had earned the entire fee. </p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed four counts of formal charges against respondent alleging
  numerous violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>With respect to the Blakes matter, the ODC alleged respondent's misconduct violates
  Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.1</span> (incompetence), <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (lack of diligence)
  and <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate).  In the Square matter, the ODC alleged
  respondent's actions violate Rules 1.3, 1.4, <span class="allegedrules">1.15(b)</span> (failure to promptly deliver
  funds or property owed to a client or third party and failure to render a full accounting upon request) and
  <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> (failure to protect client interests upon termination of representation). 
  As to the Moore matter, the ODC alleged respondent's misconduct violates Rules 1.3, 1.4,
  <span class="allegedrules">1.15(a)</span> (failure to keep client and third party funds separate from the lawyer's
  own property), 1.15(b) and 1.16(d).  Finally, in the Thomas matter, the ODC alleged respondent's misconduct violates
  Rules 1.3, 1.4 and <span class="allegedrules">1.5(f)(6)</span> (failure to account for or refund unearned fee, and/or
  place disputed funds in trust).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent filed two answers to the formal charges, essentially denying misconduct on her part. 
  Specifically, she alleged she earned most, if not all, of the fees in each client matter.</p>

  <h3>Formal Hearing</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Prior to the formal hearing, the parties entered into a joint stipulation of facts providing,
  among other things, the client matters were not completed and fees not returned.  Additionally, the stipulation
  provided that: "At all times during her representation of the complainants in these matters .  .  . respondent was
  well aware that she was suffering from emotional disabilities such that she was incapable of practicing law
  alone." </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The complainants and respondent's former secretary testified on behalf of the ODC.  Respondent
  testified on her own behalf, essentially reasserting the defenses she raised in response to the charges. 
  Additionally, she denied the existence of an attorney-client relationship with Mr. Blakes subject of Count I.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2002-09-16_00-DB-003.htm">Recommendation of the Hearing
  Committee</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The hearing committee found clear and convincing evidence of professional misconduct.  It
  determined respondent's actions harmed her clients' interests.  Relying on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer
  Sanctions</i>, the committee recognized the baseline sanction is suspension.  In aggravation, it recognized
  respondent's prior disciplinary record,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" class="fn" id="_ftnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
  pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, and little, if any, restitution.  Considering these factors, the committee
  recommended respondent be suspended for a period of one year and one day, subject to a two-year period of probation,
  with conditions to reinstatement.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2003-06-13_00-DB-003.htm">Recommendation of the Disciplinary
  Board</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board adopted the committee's factual findings and concluded respondent
  knowingly violated duties owed to her clients.  In addition to the aggravating factors cited by the  committee, the
  board recognized respondent's refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of her misconduct and the vulnerability of
  the victims.  As a mitigating factor, the board identified respondent's personal and emotional
  problems.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" class="fn" id="_ftnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on its consideration of the record, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from
  the practice of law for one year and one day, followed by a two-year period of supervised probation upon
  reinstatement.  It also proposed that respondent be required to render a full accounting to her clients and refund
  all unearned fees.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent filed an objection to the board's recommendation.  Accordingly, the  matter was
  docketed for briefing and argument in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(G).</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court.  La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B).  Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence.  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Quaid</i>,
  94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 348</span>;
  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall</i>, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d  444,
  445</a> (La. 1992)</span>.  While we are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing
  committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual
  findings.  <i>See</i> <span class="cite"><i>In re: Caulfield</i>,  96-1401 (La. 11/25/96),
  <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class="cite"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La.
  3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent's arguments are primarily factual in nature.  She contends the committee erred in
  finding she neglected her clients' matters.  Additionally, she disputes the existence of an attorney-client
  relationship in the Blakes matter.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The committee's determination that respondent violated the professional rules as charged turned
  in large measure on the credibility determinations the committee made after hearing respondent and the complainants
  testify.  In disciplinary matters where credibility determinations are central to the determination of misconduct, we
  have rarely rejected the factual findings of the committee, observing that the  committee "acts as eyes and ears of
  this court and is in a superior position to observe the nuances of demeanor evidence not revealed in a record."
  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Bolton</i>, 02-0257 (La. 6/21/02), <a href="2002-06-25_2002-0257.htm">820 So. 2d
  548</a>, 553</span>. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In the instant case, the committee was presented with two competing versions of the facts. 
  Respondent is unable to demonstrate that the hearing committee was clearly wrong in accepting the testimony of the
  complainants over her own testimony.  <i>See</i> <span class="cite"><i>Stobart v. State of Louisiana, through Dept.
  of  Trans. and Dev</i>., 617 So. 2d 880, 883 (La. 1993)</span> (". . . [W]here two permissible views of the evidence
  exist, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong.").  Accordingly, we
  accept the committee's findings that respondent abandoned her clients' legal matters, failed to communicate with her
  clients, failed to account for and refund unearned fees, and made no efforts at restitution. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Having found evidence of professional misconduct, the next issue presented for our consideration
  is the appropriate sanction for respondent's actions.  In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary
  proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the
  profession and deter future misconduct.  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>,
  <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.  The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances.  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent's misconduct is serious in nature.  Because of her neglect of Mr. Blakes' case, no
  suit was filed on his behalf within the prescriptive period.  Her neglect of the Square and Thomas matters caused
  these matters to be delayed for a period of several years.  Her neglect of the Moore matter is particularly
  egregious, as Mr. Moore died without knowing the resolution of the custody case.  Her failure to refund  unearned
  fees to her clients, all of whom were in necessitous financial circumstances,  caused them actual harm by depriving
  them of their funds for an extended period of time.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The baseline sanction for similar misconduct is generally a suspension from the practice of law
  for a period of one year and one day.  <i>See</i> <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Dooley</i>, 02-2152 (La. 2/14/03),
  <a href="2003-02-14_2002-2152.htm">841So. 2d 745</a></span> (one-year and one day suspension imposed stemming from
  neglect of a legal matter, failure to communicate with a client upon abandonment of law practice, as well as failure
  to cooperate with the ODC);  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Vaughan,</i> 00-1892 (La. 10/27/00),
  <a href="2000-10-27_2000-1892.htm">772 So.2d 87</a></span> (one-year and one day suspension imposed stemming from
  neglect of a legal matter, failure  to communicate with the client, failure to account for his fee, failure to take
  any efforts to resolve a fee dispute with his client, and abandonment of law practice); <i> <span class="CITE">In re:
  Bivins</span></i><span class="CITE">, 98-2513 (La. 12/11/98), <a href="1998-12-11_1998-2513.htm">724 So. 2d
  198</a></span> (one-year and one day suspension with probation imposed for three counts of misconduct arising from
  neglect of two client matters and abandonment of law practice); <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Kendrick</i>, 98-0623
  (La. 4/3/98), <a href="1998-04-03_1998-0623.htm">710 So. 2d 236</a></span> (one-year and one day suspension stemming
  from neglect of legal matter, failure to return fee, failure to communicate, and subsequent abandonment of his
  practice).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">While we accept the mitigating factor of respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">personal and
  emotional problems</span> during the time of the misconduct, this mitigating factor is offset by the large number of
  aggravating factors, including a <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary record</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerable victims</span> and <span class="ABAstandard">failure to make
  restitution</span>.  Under these circumstances, we see no basis to deviate from the baseline suspension. 
  Accordingly, we will suspend respondent from the  practice of law for a period of one year and one
  day.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" class="fn" id="_ftnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> </p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Gilda R. Small, Louisiana Bar Roll number 2114, is suspended from the
  practice of law for a period of one year and one day.  It is further ordered respondent render accountings to her
  clients and refund any unearned fees.  All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in
  accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality
  of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" class="fn" id="_ftn1">1</a> The employment contract was not
  placed into evidence.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" class="fn" id="_ftn2">2</a> For reasons which are not clear
  from the record, respondent listed Mr. Adebamiji as counsel of record for Mr. Blakes and signed his name on the
  petition.  It does not appear Mr. Adebamiji was aware of this pleading.  According to respondent, she had blanket
  authority from Mr. Adebamiji to sign his name to pleadings.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" class="fn" id="_ftn3">3</a> Initially, respondent failed to
  cooperate in the ODC's investigation of Mr. Blakes' complaint.  In 1995, the disciplinary board issued an admonition
  to respondent based on her failure to cooperate.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" class="fn" id="_ftn4">4</a> The formal charges allege Ms.
  Square paid respondent $175.  Presumably, this is a typographical error, as the undisputed evidence in the record
  demonstrates  Ms. Square paid respondent a $510 flat fee and $65 in court costs, for a total of $575.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" class="fn" id="_ftn5">5</a> Originally, there were six
  counts of formal charges filed against respondent; however, two of these counts were later withdrawn by the ODC.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" class="fn" id="_ftn6">6</a> Respondent has been admonished
  on four occasions by the disciplinary board.  Three of these arose from her failure to cooperate with the ODC and one
  arose from her failure to return client property. Additionally, respondent has been declared ineligible to practice
  law on several occasions based on her failure to pay bar dues or comply with her mandatory continuing legal education
  requirements.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7" class="fn" id="_ftn7">7</a> However, the board observed
  there was insufficient evidence in the record to determine whether respondent suffered from a mental disability.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8" class="fn" id="_ftn8">8</a> The hearing committee also
  recommended that respondent's reinstatement be conditioned upon a mental health evaluation to determine if she is
  emotionally competent to resume the practice of law.  Although such a condition may be beneficial, we decline to
  impose it at this time.  Conditions of reinstatement,  along with any other relevant factors, may be addressed if and
  when respondent applies for reinstatement.  <i>See</i> Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24 (E); <span class="cite"><i>In re:
