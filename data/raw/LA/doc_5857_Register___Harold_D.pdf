  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">LOUISIANA ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE:  HAROLD D. REGISTER, JR.</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">01-DB-071 consolidated with 02-DB-112</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">This consolidated matter arises out of two attorney disciplinary proceedings. The first
  proceeding (Board Docket Number 01-DB-071) involved formal charges consisting of one count filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against the Respondent, Harold D. Register, Jr., of Lafayette ("Respondent"); the second
  proceeding (Board Docket Number 02-DB-112) involves a petition for consent discipline filed by Respondent.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On August 1, 2002, to address the misconduct associated with the formal charges filed in Board
  Docket Number 01-DB-071, the Board issued a public reprimand and ordered Respondent placed on probation with special
  conditions for one year.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" class="fn" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> On October 31, 2002,
  Respondent filed a Petition for Consent Discipline to address an additional investigative matter initiated by ODC
  (Investigative File Number 14222). In his petition, Respondent asserts that the new investigative matter "entail[s]
  the same problems recently addressed by the discipline imposed in matter numbered 01-DB-071." Respondent submits that
  a public reprimand and eighteen months of probation with special conditions is sufficient "to resolve both
  matters."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On January 29, 2003, ODC filed a motion to consolidate Board Docket Number 02-DB-112 with Board
  Docket Number 01-DB-071. ODC requested that the two matters be consolidated so that the Board could consider the
  Respondent's conduct conjointly. On January 30, 2003, the chair of Disciplinary Board Panel "A" ordered the matters
  consolidated.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After review of both matters, the Board finds the proposed sanction to be appropriate to address
  the misconduct which has occurred in Board Docket Number 01-DB-071 and Board Docket Number 02-DB-112. Accordingly,
  the Board orders that Harold D. Register, Jr. be issued a public reprimand as the sanction in this consolidated
  matter and be placed on supervised probation for a period of eighteen months, subject to the special conditions
  outlined below.</p>

  <h2>BOARD DOCKET NUMBER 01-DB-071</h2>

  <h3>I.  Procedural History</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Formal charges were filed on July 9, 2001. In the charges, ODC alleged that the Respondent
  violated Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3 (diligence), 1.4 (communication), 1.5 (fees), 1.15(a)(b)(c) (safekeeping
  property), 1.16 (declining or terminating re-presentation) and 8.4(a)(c) (misconduct) in connection with his
  representation of one client, Mr. Gregory Jerome Lazard.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Respondent was served with the formal charges at his primary registration address on July 13,
  2001. On August, 10, 2001, he filed an Answer, which he clarified on August 23, stipulating to the facts and
  requesting a hearing for the purpose of determining a sanction.  The parties entered into a Joint Stipulation of
  Facts on November 20, 2001.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" class="fn" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A hearing was held on December 6, 2001.  There being no dispute as to the facts, ODC offered
  thirteen exhibits to support its case and rested. The Respondent testified on his own behalf and offered four
  exhibits, however the record was left open for the submission of additional exhibits by the Respondent as well as
  post-hearing memoranda from the parties.  The complainant also testified at the hearing. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Hearing Committee submitted its report on February 21, 2002.  It found that Respondent
  violated Rule 1.3 (lack of diligence), Rule 1.5 (unclear fee arrangement), Rule 1.15(a), (b), and (c) (safekeeping
  client's property), and Rule 8.4(a) (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct).  Impressed by the Respondent's
  candor and character, the Committee found numerous mitigating factors which it weighed heavily.  The Committee
  recommended that the Respondent be publicly reprimanded subject to certain conditions. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Board Docket Number 01-DB-071 first came before the Disciplinary Board on April 25, 2002.  ODC
  filed an objection suggesting that the recommended sanction was too lenient and that the appropriate sanction should
  be a six-month suspension, deferred, with probation as recommended by the Hearing Committee.  The Respondent
  concurred with the recommendation of the Committee and waived his right to oral argument. The Board issued its ruling
  on August 1, 2002, ordering that the Respondent receive a public reprimand and be placed on probation for a period of
  one year, subject to various conditions.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On January 29, 2003, ODC filed a motion to consolidate Board Docket Number 02-DB-112 with Board
  Docket Number 01-DB-071. ODC requested that the two matters be consolidated so that the Board could consider the
  Respondent's conduct conjointly. On January 30, 2003, the chair of Disciplinary Board Panel "A" ordered the matters
  consolidated.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Panel A reviewed the Board's ruling in Board Docket Number 01-DB-071 and reviewed the consent
  discipline petition in Board Docket Number 02-DB-112 on January 30, 2003. The parties waived appearances; therefore,
  oral argument was not conducted.</p>

  <h3>II.  The Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The formal charges in this matter read, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div id="fc02-DB-112">
      <h4>COUNT</h4>

      <p>On or about March 20, 1997, Gregory Jerome Lazard retained your services in a personal injury matter.  On June
      4, 1997, you and Mr. Lazard executed <i>Affidavit of Assignment of Settlement</i> to protect child support
      arrearages.  On September 15, 1997, you deposited a partial settlement check in the amount of $8,550.00 into your
      "clients account."  On October 8, 1997, you deposited the final settlement check in the amount of $13,750.00 into
      your "clients account."  You disbursed Mr. Lazard's portion of the settlement proceeds to him on December 16,
      1997.  You withheld $2,067.52 for payment under the assignment of settlement.</p>

      <p>In March 1998, Mr. Lazard advised you that $918.00 of his income tax refund had been transferred to the Bureau
      of Child Support Enforcement.  On March 18, 1998 you issued a "clients account" check in the amount of $918.00 to
      Mr. Lazard in reimbursement of the amount withheld by the Internal Revenue Service.  On June 4, 1998, you
      disbursed $1,101.84, and on December 11, 1998, you disbursed $725.00 from your "clients account" pursuant to the
      assignment of settlement.</p>

      <p>At various times between September 15, 1997, and December 11, 1998, your "clients account" was overdrawn
      and/or did not contain funds sufficient to pay the financial obligations connected with Mr. Lazard's case.</p>

      <p>On March 20, 1997, Mr. Lazard executed your Contract of Employment that provides as follows:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p> (1) 33 1/3% of gross recovery realized through compromise without necessity or filing suit;</p>

        <p> (2) If in fact the case goes to trial, the attorney's fee will be 40% of the total recovery.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Mr. Lazard's case was settled without the necessity of a trial.  You withheld an attorney's fee of 40% of the
      gross settlement amount.</p>

      <p>You failed to promptly disburse settlement funds, improperly used a client trust account, commingled and
      converted client funds, failed to have a clear fee agreement, and you collected an improper contingent fee.  Your
      conduct violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span>, <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span>,
      <span class="allegedrules">1.5</span>, <span class="allegedrules">1.15(a)(b)(c)</span>,
      <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span>, and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)(c)</span> of the Rules of
      Professional Conduct.</p>
    </div>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>III.  Stipulated Facts</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC and the Respondent entered into a Joint Stipulation of Facts in which the Respondent admitted
  the following:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>On or about March 20, 1997, Gregory Jerome Lazard retained my services in a personal injury matter.  On June 4,
    1997, Mr. Lazard and I executed an Affidavit of Assignment of Settlement to protect child support arrearages.  On
    September 15, 1997, I deposited a partial settlement check in the amount of $8,550.00 into my "client account."  On

    <p>In March 1998, Mr. Lazard advised me that $918.00 of his income tax refund had been transferred to the Bureau of

    <p class="bodycopy">(2) If in fact the case goes to trial, the attorney's fee will be 40% of the total
    recovery.</p>

    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">Mr. Lazard's case was settled without the necessity of a trial.  I withheld an
    attorney's fee of 40% of the gross settlement amount.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>IV. <span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2002-02-21_01-DB-071.htm">The Hearing Committee's Report</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Considering the documentary evidence and the testimony, the Committee found that the Respondent
  violated Rules 1.3 (diligence), 1.5 (unclear fee arrangement), 1.15(a)(b)(c) (safekeeping property) and 8.4(a)
  (misconduct) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  The Hearing Committee did not find violations of Rule 1.4
  (communication with client), Rule 1.16(d) (duties upon termination of the representation), and Rule 8.4(c) (conduct
  involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In brief, the Committee found that the Respondent failed to promptly disburse funds which he had
  withheld from his client's settlement to pay the client's child support obligation simply because he forgot to make
  the disbursement to the appropriate agency; that overdrafts in the Respondent's trust account were caused by
  miscalculation and sloppiness, not mischief; and that while the Respondent's contract of employment (which Respondent
  did not write) was ambiguous, the Respondent believed in good faith that he was entitled to a forty percent fee. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  The Committee found that Respondent breached duties owed to his client, that his actions were
  negligent and caused no harm.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" class="fn" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a>  The committee found
  two aggravating factors:  one prior private admonition and substantial experience in the practice of
  law.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" class="fn" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a> In mitigation, the committee found the
  following:  absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, prompt good faith effort to rectify the misconduct, full and
  free disclosure to the ODC and Hearing Committee, cooperative attitude toward the proceedings, good character and
  reputation, and willingness to accept without argument whatever conditions or penalties might be imposed.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In determining a sanction, the Committee considered the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer
  Sanctions</i> ("ABA Standards"), the cases cited by the parties and other Louisiana Supreme Court cases. It
  recommended that the Respondent be issued a public reprimand.  The Committee further recommended that the Respondent
  be placed on probation for a period of one year; that he submit on a quarterly basis, an audit of his trust
  account(s) to ODC or his probation monitor along with written certification of compliance with the Rules of
  Professional Conduct and a detailed report outlining his policies and procedures for assuring compliance with
  applicable trust account rules; and that he pay all costs.</p>

  <h3><b>V.  Analysis</b></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The powers and duties of the Disciplinary Board are defined in Section 2 of the Louisiana Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement.  Subsection (G)(2)(a) states that the Board is "to perform
  appellate review functions, consisting of review of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of
  hearing committees with respect to formal charges . . . and prepare and forward to the court its own findings, if
  any, and recommendations."</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Inasmuch as the Board is serving in an appellate capacity, the standard of review applied to
  findings of fact is that of "manifest error." <i>Arceneaux v. Domingue</i>, 365 So. 2d 1330 (La.1978); <i>Rosell v.
  ESCO</i>, 549 So. 2d 840 (La. 1989).  The Board conducts a <i>de novo</i> review of the hearing committee's
  application of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  <i>In re Hill</i>, 90-DB-004. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A review of the record in this matter reveals that the hearing committee's findings of fact are
  supported by the record, save one inconsequential finding noted in footnote 13, and are not manifestly
  erroneous. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In addition to the stipulated facts, the Hearing Committee found that on December 23, 1997,
  $147.68 of the $2,067.52 withheld to satisfy the complainant's child support obligation was disbursed to the
  complainant because the amount withheld was more than the amount due for the non-support.  The Hearing Committee
  determined that from mid-December until March, Respondent simply forgot to forward the withheld funds to the child
  support agency.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" class="fn" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>  In March the Respondent disbursed
  $918.00 to the complainant after the child support agency seized the complainant's income tax refund, leaving a
  balance of $1,001.84.  This amount was forwarded to the Bureau of Child Support Enforcement after an exchange of some
  correspondence between the Respondent and the child support agency regarding the amount that was actually owed. 
  Then, on December 11, 1998, after the agency claimed that $725.00 was still due, Respondent disbursed $725.00 of his
  own funds to the agency.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" class="fn" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a>  After hearing testimony
  from Respondent and Mr. Lazard, the Hearing Committee concluded that by December 11, 1998, the arrearages had grown
  because of Mr. Lazard's continued non-payment of his monthly child support obligations and although Respondent did
  not have sufficient money on hand, he disbursed the $725.00 to help his client and make amends for his delay in
  completing the disbursement in the first place. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Regarding the overdrawn trust account, in addition to the stipulated facts, the Committee found
  that the overdrafts were the result of over-disbursements made to another client as a result of miscalculation of the
  other client's settlement proceeds, and sloppy bookkeeping.  The Respondent testified that it had been his practice,
  after settling a personal injury case, to deposit the check into his trust account, make all related disbursements,
  and to leave his fee in the account.  He would then use those funds to pay expenses related to other clients'
  personal injury cases.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" class="fn" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a>  Personal injury matters
  constituted approximately twenty percent of his practice.  The Respondent used this system to keep his personal
  injury practice floating.  It was his way of "sort of like hiding money from myself, because once you put it in the
  operating account, the money goes so fast . . . ."<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref9">[9]</a> </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This system normally worked for him except that in the instant matter, his trust account dropped
  below the amount withheld to cover the child support obligation.  During the same period, he settled another matter
  for $220,000.00.  He received a check for $210,000.00, which he deposited in his trust account.  An additional
  $10,000.00 was to be paid in the future.  Respondent calculated his fee based on the $220,000.00 figure and withdrew
  his fee from the account.  Notably, he only charged a one-third fee, "to help the client out,"<a href="#_ftn10"
  name="_ftnref10" class="fn" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a> even though he felt that he was entitled to charge a forty
  percent fee, inasmuch as suit had been filed.  In any case, by calculating his fee based on the higher figure, his
  trust account was left short resulting in the balance dropping below the amount needed to cover expenses in that
  matter<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" class="fn" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a> and the complainant's child support
  lien. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">After speaking with Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, Respondent ceased the practice of using his
  trust account as a pseudo-operating account to fund his personal injury practice and took additional steps to set up
  proper accounts for handling funds.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" class="fn" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As to the excessive fee, the Committee determined that the Respondent withheld an attorney's fee
  of forty percent.  He did so in good faith, believing that once the suit was filed, he was entitled to collect that
  fee.  Respondent believed that the withholding of a forty percent fee was the intent of the parties and honestly
  believed that Mr. Lazard was in agreement with the fee, as evidenced by Mr. Lazard's signature on the disbursement
  sheet.  The Committee also found that the Respondent has since changed his contract to clear up the ambiguity and,
  with respect to the complainant, has reimbursed the difference between the thirty-three and a third and forty percent
  fee.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" class="fn" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a>  The Respondent did not reimburse the
  difference earlier because he did not think that it would be proper to do so during the pendency of the disciplinary
  proceedings.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" class="fn" id="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In addition to the Committee's findings, it should also be noted that Respondent did not draft
  the contract.  He obtained it from other attorneys.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref15">[15]</a>  Also, no other client complained about the fee provisions of the contract and if a client
  had complained, the Respondent testified that he would have refunded the difference.<a href="#_ftn16"
  name="_ftnref16" class="fn" id="_ftnref16">[16]</a> </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The record supports the findings of fact and the Committee was not manifestly erroneous. Further,
  the Committee correctly determined that the Respondent violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (diligence),
  <span class="Rules">1.5</span> (unclear fee arrangement), <span class="Rules">1.15(a)(b)(c)</span> (safekeeping
  property) and <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> (misconduct) of the Rules of Professional Conduct; that he acted
  negligently; and that his actions caused little to no harm.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref17">[17]</a>  Accordingly, the Board adopts the Committee's findings.</p>

  <h2>BOARD DOCKET NUMBER 02-DB-112</h2>

  <h3><b>I.  Procedural History</b></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On October 31, 2002, Respondent filed a Petition for Consent Discipline, affidavit of consent,
  waiver of opportunity to withdraw consent, and a stipulation of facts to address alleged violations of Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (diligence), <span class="Rules">1.4</span> (communication), and
  <span class="Rules">1.15</span> (safekeeping property) of the Rules of Professional Conduct under investigation by
  ODC as the result of a complaint filed by one of Respondent's former clients. The same day, ODC filed its concurrence
  in the petition and a memorandum in support of the proposed sanction.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On January 29, 2003, ODC filed a motion to consolidate Board Docket Number 02-DB-112 with Board
  Docket Number 01-DB-071. ODC requested that the two matters be consolidated so that the Board could consider the
  Respondent's conduct conjointly. On January 30, 2003, the chair of Disciplinary Board Panel "A" granted ODC's
  motion.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Panel A reviewed the Board's ruling in Board Docket Number 01-DB-071 and reviewed the consent
  discipline petition in Board Docket Number 02-DB-112 on January 30, 2003. The parties waived appearances; therefore,
  oral argument was not conducted.</p>

  <h3>II.  Stipulated Facts</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The stipulation of facts filed in Board Docket Number 02-DB-112 provides in pertinent parts:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <h4>I.</h4>

    <p>Harold D. Register was admitted to practice law on September 18<sup>th</sup>, 1985.</p>

    <h4>II.</h4>

    <p>Harold D. Register is currently eligible to practice law in Louisiana by the Louisiana Supreme Court. Mr.
    Register was previously admonished for a violation of 1.3, and 1.4 in 01-ADB-023. In August of 2002, the Louisiana
    Attorney Disciplinary Board issued Mr. Register a public reprimand with special conditions in matter numbered
    01-DB-071.</p>

    <h4>III.</h4>

    <p>Investigative file 14222 involves Mr. Register's representation of Mr. Jerome Sonnier and his wife. Mr. Register
    was hired to handle several personal injury cases as well as assist in a criminal matter. While there was some
    contact between the parties Mr. Register failed to provide his clients with adequate information to keep them aware
    of the status and progress of the cases and let them intelligently participate making decisions that affected the
    cases. One fact that increased communication problems is that Mr. Sonnier cannot read. Additionally, Mr. Register
    has been unable to produce detailed financial records regarding the cases involving the Sonnier family. Records
    indicate that Mr. Register may have used his client's trust account as an operating account. There is evidence that
    Mr. Register advanced the Sonnier family money on their tort cases out of his trust account. Mr. Register contends
    that the funds advanced were his own fees from other cases that were left in the trust account.  Mr. Register has
    lost some records and other records were turned over to the clients. Mr. Register's conduct in this case violated
    Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 1.15 of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The conduct giving rise to the violations appears to
    arise at the same time as his conduct in matter numbered 01-DB-071. In mitigation, Mr. Register submits that he has
    taken steps to improve his practice.  Mr. Register is remorseful and apologizes for any disservice to his clients
    or the profession, due to the errors and oversights he made. Mr. Register is willing to adhere to the Rules of
    Professional Conduct in the future, and fully cooperate with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.  In further
    mitigation, Mr. Register would incorporate all the factors considered by the Hearing Committee and Louisiana
    Attorney Disciplinary Board in matter numbered 01-DB-071.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>III. Petition for Consent Discipline</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The petition for consent discipline filed by Respondent states in pertinent parts:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <h4>I.</h4>

    <p>Harold Register, Jr. has tendered to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel his Affidavit of Consent Discipline in
    the above captioned proceeding involving investigative file 14222. Harold Register contends that the matters
    investigated in file number 14222 entail the same problems recently addressed by the discipline imposed in matter
    numbered 01-DB-071.</p>

    <h4>II.</h4>

    <p>Conditioned upon the stated discipline being imposed and consolidated with matter number 01-DB-071, Harold
    Register, Jr. admits to having violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 1.15 of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

    <h4>III.</h4>

    <p>Pursuant to Rule XIX, Section 20, Harold Register, Jr., waives his right to argue the above referenced

      <li>Eighteen (18) months supervised probation with the condition that Mr. Register responds to all reasonable

      <li>Respondent at his own cost shall submit quarterly to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel or his probation
      monitor his certification that his trust account(s) are in compliance with the applicable Rules of Professional
      Conduct, along with a detailed report outlining his policies and procedures for assuring compliance with the
      Rules of Professional Conduct.</li>

      <li>Respondent at his own cost shall submit quarterly to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel or his probation

      <li>Respondent and the CPA will review the settlements and financial disbursements regarding the Sonnier family's
      cases to make sure they are accurate and will submit a report of said findings. If warranted Respondent will
      refund excess fees or voluntarily participate in the Louisiana State Bar Association Fee Resolution Program

  <h3>IV. Analysis</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 1.15 of the Rules
  of Professional Conduct.  The Board must accept that Respondent has violated these rules.  <span class="CITE"><i>In
  re Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96); <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a>.</span> Given the
  violation of these rules, the Board is left to determine if the proposed sanction of public reprimand and eighteen
  months supervised probation with special conditions is appropriate to address Respondent's misconduct in Board Docket
  Number 01-DB-071 and Board Docket Number 02-DB-112.</p>

  <h2>THE APPROPRIATE SANCTION ANALYSIS</h2>

  <h3>I.  Rule XIX, Section 10(C) Factors</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the
      profession;</li>

      <li>whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</li>

      <li>the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</li>

      <li>the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based upon a review of the documents, the Board finds Respondent negligently violated duties owed
  to his clients.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" class="fn" id="_ftnref18">[18]</a> The Board further finds that,
  while the record in Board Docket Number 01-DB-071 does not reflect any significant harm to his clients, in Board
  Docket Number 02-DB-112 the Sonniers' legal matter was jeopardized and the Sonniers may have suffered some financial
  harm.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In connection with Board Docket Number 01-DB-071, it is evident that the hearing committee, while
  acknowledging Respondent's misconduct, was greatly impressed by Respondent's candor and character and attached great
  weight to the mitigating factors.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" class="fn" id="_ftnref19">[19]</a>  Likewise, the
  Board is impressed by Respondent's character and reputation.  In addition to the many factors highlighted by the
  Committee, it should be noted that Respondent is one of only three or four indigent defenders in his area qualified
  to defend capital cases.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" class="fn" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a> Based on the hearing
  committee's findings in the first matter and a review of the record in the second matter, the Board finds the
  following mitigating factors are present here: (1) absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; (2) timely good faith
  effort to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; (3) full and free disclosure to disciplinary
  board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; (4) character and reputation; and (5) remorse.<a href="#_ftn21"
  name="_ftnref21" class="fn" id="_ftnref21">[21]</a> The Board finds the following aggravating factors are present
  here: (1) substantial experience in the practice of law;<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref22">[22]</a> and (2) a prior disciplinary offense (<i>See</i> Board Docket Number
  01-ADB-043).<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" class="fn" id="_ftnref23">[23]</a></p>

  <h3>II.  ABA Standards</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanction</i>
  ("Standard") to determine the baseline sanction by determining "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's mental state
  and the extent of the injury caused; and then adjust[ing] the sanction in accordance with the aggravating and
  mitigating factors present."  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94);
  <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 350</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The proposed sanction is in line with the ABA guidelines.  Under ABA Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.13</span>, a "[r]eprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent in dealing
  with client property and causes injury or potential injury to a client." Here, Respondent has been negligent in
  dealing with client funds as well as with records relating to those funds. Although the record does not show actual
  harm has occurred, the potential harm of loss of funds belonging to Respondent's clients existed.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Under ABA Standard 4.43 a "[r]eprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent and
  does not act with reasonable diligence in representing a client, and causes injury or potential injury to a client."
  Here, Respondent failed to adequately communicate with the Sonniers or to diligently pursue their legal matter. As a
  result, the Sonniers' legal matter was jeopardized. Furthermore, Respondent failed to promptly forward child support
  payments received from Mr. Lazard. As a result, Mr. Lazard's tax refund was withheld from him.</p>

  <h3><b>III. Relevant Case Law</b></h3>

  <h4>A.  Misuse of trust account/commingling</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board also looks to relevant case law for assistance in determining an appropriate sanction
  for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. A review of the Louisiana jurisprudence reveals that in cases
  involving misuse of trust account and commingling, the Court has imposed sanctions ranging from public reprimand to
  eighteen months suspension, totally deferred.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref24">[24]</a> </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <span class="CITE"><i>In re Estess</i>, 98-2741 (La. 1/14/99);
  <a href="../SC/1999-01-08_1998-2741.htm">740 So. 2d 93</a></span>, the court ordered a one year suspension, with nine
  months deferred, and two years of  probation, arising out of a finding that the attorney commingled personal funds
  with client funds in his trust account.  Estess, who apparently had a gambling and drinking problem possibly
  attributable to medication, left a $190,000.00 fee in his trust account.  He wrote checks on the trust account to pay
  for gambling and personal necessities.  The court noted that there was no conversion, however, there was the
  potential that such conversion could have occurred which justified some period of actual suspension.  It is
  interesting to note that Chief Justice Calogero concurred  because Estess consented to the discipline, but agreed
  with a Board member who had commented that there was no misuse of the trust account and found the commingling to be
  only a technical violation.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In <span class="CITE"><i>In re Reed</i>, 99-3435 (La. 1/14/00);
  <a href="../SC/2000-01-19_1999-3435.htm">753 So.2d 175</a></span>, also a consent matter, the Court imposed a
  six-month suspension, totally deferred and one year supervised probation.  Reed was charged with improper handling of
  funds in his trust account and that he had commingled and converted $2,000.00.  The court noted significant
  mitigating factors.  It determined that the consent discipline was adequate and would serve to protect the
  public.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy"><span class="CITE"><i>In re Jones</i>, 98-0971 (La. 11/6/98);
  <a href="../SC/1998-11-06_1998-0971.htm">721 So.2d 850</a></span>, did not involve consent discipline.  In that
  matter, Jones distributed settlement funds but retained $2500.00 to cover payment of future medical bills.  Bank
  records showed that only one debt was paid, that being for $270.00.  The records also showed that the balance of the
  trust account fell below $2500.00 on several occasions.  Jones failed to respond to client inquiries concerning the
  fund and failed to pay an outstanding medical bill.  The court imposed a one-year suspension with all but two months
  deferred followed by a two-year probationary period.  The court noted that Jones was indifferent to the proper
  handling of client funds, which it found disturbing in light of his substantial experience in the practice of
  law.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The court determined that public reprimand was the appropriate sanction in
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Mayeaux</i>, 99-3549 (La. 5/16/00); <a href="../SC/2000-05-16_1999-3549.htm">762 So.2d
  1072</a></span>.  In <i>Mayeaux</i>, the facts were not disputed.  Mayeaux was retained to represent a client in a
  personal injury matter.  Mayeaux personally guaranteed the client's medical expenses and advanced her monies for
  living expenses and medical tests during the course of the litigation.  The case proceeded to trial in 1994. 
  Although Mayeaux successfully obtained a judgment in favor of his client which totaled $42,483.89, including judicial
  interest, the amount of the judgment was not sufficient to cover his attorney's fees and all of the costs and medical
  expenses.  Despite this fact, Mayeaux reduced his legal fee in order to give his client $2,000.00 from the proceeds
  of the judgment.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Mayeaux deposited the funds received as a result of the judgment into his operating account,
  rather than his trust account, with the intent of attempting to negotiate a reduction in the medical expenses charged
  by the third-party medical providers.  Over the next several months and on several occasions, the balance of his
  collection account dropped below the amount held for the third-party medical providers, and on at least one occasion
  dropped to zero.  Eventually, Mayeaux successfully negotiated a reduction in the medical expenses and fully paid all
  the third-party health care providers.  As a result of the reduction in the medical expenses, Mayeaux was able to
  cover his attorney's fees, and he refunded an additional $300 to his client.  Nevertheless, the client filed a
  complaint with ODC. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Board recommended a fully deferred three-month suspension and six months of supervised
  probation with conditions.  The court rejected the recommendation, and imposed a public reprimand, finding that there
  was no actual harm sustained; that Mayeaux gained no personal benefit from his misconduct; and that Mayeaux refunded
  $2000.00 of his attorney's fees to the client in order to give her some money from the short recovery.  The Court
  noted additional mitigating factors such as the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, cooperative attitude toward
  the disciplinary proceedings, character and reputation, and remorse.  It noted one aggravating factor:  a prior
  unrelated disciplinary matter.</p>

  <h4>B.  Lack of diligence/failure to communicate</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">A review of the Louisiana jurisprudence indicates that a public reprimand is appropriate for
  Respondent's lack of diligence and failure to adequately communicate with his clients. In the cases of
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Brown</i>, <a href="2001-05-04_00-DB-016.htm">00-DB-016</a> (La.  Discp. Bd.,
  5/4/2001)</span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re Brown</i>, <a href="2000-06-13_00-DB-047.htm">00-DB-047</a> (La. Discp.
  Bd., 7/31/2000)</span>; and <span class="CITE"><i>In re Laiche</i>, <a href="1999-07-15_98-DB-057.htm">98-DB-057</a>
  (La. Discp. Bd., 7/15/1999)</span>, the Disciplinary Board issued public reprimands for misconduct similar to that
  seen in the instant matter.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In <i>Brown</i> (00-DB-016), a client retained the attorney to represent him in a claim for
  damages against the Sheriff of St. Tammany Parish. Brown filed the matter in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
  District of Louisiana. Brown did not file mandatory pre-trial inserts on behalf of his client prior to the pre-trial
  conference because the client had failed to provide the names of his witnesses and Brown believed that all of his
  client's documentary evidence was already in the record. As a result had the matter gone to trial, Brown's client
  would have been limited in his ability to call witnesses and introduce evidence.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The matter later was compromised before trial for the sum of $500.00. Prior to this settlement
  being accepted by the client, Brown failed to inform the client that after the expenses and attorney's fee were
  withheld, the client would receive approximately $55.00 from the total settlement.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Board determined that Brown's actions were negligent and resulted in actual injury to his
  client. Although the Board found the presence of the mitigating factors of absence of a prior disciplinary record and
  remorse, no aggravating factors were noted. Based on these findings, the Board accepted Brown's petition for consent
  discipline and issued a public reprimand for violations of Rule 1.3 (diligence), 1.4(a) (communication), and 1.15(b)
  (safekeeping property) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In <i>Brown</i> (00-DB-047), the attorney received the client's file from his former associate
  who had been handling the matter for several years. Thereafter, Brown failed to take any steps to pursue the case or
  to keep the client informed as to the case's status for over a year. Upon considering the aggravating factors, which
  included substantial experience in the practice of law, and the mitigating factor of the absence of a prior
  disciplinary record, the Board issued a public reprimand for violations of Rules 1.3 (diligence) and 1.4(a)
  (communication) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In <i>Laiche</i> (98-DB-057), the attorney was alleged to have filed a personal injury suit and
  thereafter failed to prosecute it for eight years. Laiche also was alleged to have failed to keep his clients
  informed as to the progress or lack of progress of the case; failed to timely inform his clients of a settlement
  offer, which he rejected without consulting his clients; failed to return a file; and failed to timely sign a motion
  to substitute counsel for clients who had discharged him. The only aggravating factor was Laiche's substantial
  experience in the practice of law. Mitigating factors include the absence of a disciplinary record, no dishonest or
  selfish motive, a timely good faith effort to rectify the misconduct, and lack of harm to the clients. The Board
  accepted the parties joint petition for consent discipline and issued a public reprimand for violations of Rule 1.3
  (diligence), 1.4 (communication), and 1.16(d) (improper termination of representation) of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct.</p>

  <h4>C.  Conclusion</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">Considering the baseline sanctions for each of the rule violations, the case law, the heavy
  mitigating factors, and the purpose of attorney discipline (not primarily to punish, but to deter like conduct and to
  protect the public),<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" class="fn" id="_ftnref25">[25]</a> the sanction proposed by
  Respondent is appropriate and is accepted by the Board.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">  In connection with Board Docket Number 01-DB-071, the Board adopts the Hearing Committee's
  findings of fact. Based on these findings and the stipulation of facts submitted by parties in connection with both
  matters, the Board finds that Respondent's proposed sanction contained in his petition for consent discipline filed
  in Board Docket Number 02-DB-112 is appropriate to address the misconduct in this consolidated matter. Accordingly,
  the Board orders that Harold D. Register, Jr. be issued a public reprimand and be placed on probation for a period of
  eighteen months, subject to the following conditions:</p>

  disciplinary hearing</u> was clearly inappropriate and should not be repeated."</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" class="fn" id="_ftn2">[2]</a> Those rules provide, in
  pertinent parts:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="footnotetext">RULE 1.3 DILIGENCE<br />
    A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</p>

    pursued, to the extent the client is willing and able to do so.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext"><b>RULE 1.5 FEES<br />
    (a)</b> A lawyer's fee shall be reasonable. The factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee
    include the following:</p>

    <p class="footnotetext"><b>(1)</b> The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions
    involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;<br />
      <b>(2)</b> The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will
    preclude other employment by the lawyer;<br />
      <b>(3)</b> The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;<br />
      <b>(4)</b> The amount involved and the results obtained;<br />
      <b>(5)</b> The time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;<br />
      <b>(6)</b> The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;<br />
      <b>(7)</b> The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and<br />
      <b>(8)</b> Whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext"><b>(b)</b> When the lawyer has not regularly represented the client, the basis or rate of
    the fee shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after
    commencing the representation.<br />
    <b>(c)</b> A fee may be contingent on the outcome of the matter for which the service is rendered except in a

    in writing and shall state the method by which the fee is to be determined, including the percentage or percentages
    that shall accrue to the lawyer in the event of settlement, trial or appeal litigation and other expenses to be
    deducted from the recovery, and whether such expenses are to be deducted before or after the contingent fee is
    calculated. Upon conclusion of a contingent fee matter, the lawyer shall provide the client with a written
    statement stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is recovery, showing the remittance to the client and the
    method of its determination.<br />
    <b>(d)</b> A lawyer shall not enter into an arrangement for, charge, or collect:</p>

    <p class="footnotetext"><b>(1)</b> Any fee in a domestic relations matter, the payment or amount of which is
    contingent upon the securing of a divorce or upon the amount of alimony or support, or property settlement in lieu
    thereof; or<br />
      <b>(2)</b> A contingent fee for representing a defendant in a criminal case.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext"><b>(e)</b> A division of fee between lawyers who are not in the same firm may be made only
    if:</p>

    <p class="footnotetext"><b>(1)</b> The division is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or, by
    written agreement with the client, each lawyer assumes joint responsibilities for the representation;</p>

    <p class="footnotetext"><b>(2)</b> The client is advised of and does not object to the participation of all the
    lawyers involved; and <b>(3)</b> The total fee is reasonable.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext"><b>* * *</b></p>

    <p class="footnotetext"><b>RULE 1.15  SAFEKEEPING PROPERTY</b></p>

    <p class="footnotetext"><b>(a)</b> A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer's
    possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer's own property. Funds shall be kept in a
    separate account maintained in a bank or similar institution in the state where the lawyer's office is situated, or
    elsewhere with the consent of the client or third person. Other property shall be identified as such and
    appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such account funds and other property shall be kept by the lawyer

    privilege, a final judgment addressing disposition of those funds or property, or a written agreement by the client

  during the investigative phase of Mr. Lazard's complaint, Disciplinary Counsel pointed out that the Respondent's

  arbitration. There is no basis for this finding in the record.  Although the arbitration was not scheduled, there is
  no evidence to suggest that it was the complainant who was remiss in this regard.  Statement of Oct. 4, 1999, p. 44.

    <p class="footnotetext">Respondent's practice consists primarily of criminal defense work.  He is a public
    defender, having served as Assistant Public Defender in Opelousas, and as one of the Public Defenders in Lafayette
    Parish for the last 10 years.  He is also a contract attorney for the Lafayette City-Parish Consolidated
    Government.  The Respondent expressed concern that he wished not to lose these jobs, because his contracts for
    these public jobs require him to remain in good standing with the Bar.  The Respondent also conducts a general
    practice, including bankruptcy, worker's compensation, and child support.  About 20% of his practice comprises
    personal injury work.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">The Respondent went to Southern University in 1975, graduated in 1979 with a degree in
    political science.  Then from 1979 to 1981 he got a scholarship to go to Trinity University in San Antonio, where
    he received a master's degree in urban studies.  He came back to Baton Rouge and went to Southern University and
    got his juris doctor degree in 1984, then went into the military, the Judge Advocate General Corps, and from 1984
    to 1985 attended Officers' Indoctrination School and Naval Justice School in Newport, Rhode Island, graduating in
    1985.  Then from 1985 to 1987 he was assigned to the Naval Station, Long Beach, California, and served from 1987 to
    1989 as the Staff Judge Advocate for the Naval Air Station in Corpus Christi, Texas. </p>

    <p class="footnotetext">The Respondent has been a member of a male gospel group for the last ten years, a group
    which he helped to start in 1991 for young black males in need of guidance.  A nonprofit group, called "In Jesus'
    Name," they sing every other weekend at various churches, civic groups and the like, trying to inspire young people
    to put God first and get an education.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">The Respondent was asked to serve on the Board of the Lafayette Parish Bar Association
    during calendar year 2002, he tentatively accepted, but declined indicating that he was concerned about the present
    disciplinary proceeding.  Respondent indicated willingness to serve in the future. </p>

    <p class="footnotetext">The Respondent was appointed and has served as a bar examiner, grading bar exams, and has
    served on the Professional and Quality of Life Committee chaired by Judge John Conery of the 16th Judicial
    District.  Additionally, Respondent has been practicing since 1989, has been President of the Southwestern
    Louisiana Lawyers Association, an association which consists of all of the black lawyers in eight civil parishes
    around Lafayette and the Acadiana region.  Respondent served as President of that organization for more than five
    years.</p>

  5-11.  Respondent's contracts of employment as a public defender and attorney with the Lafayette City-Parish
  Consolidated Government  provide for termination upon suspension or disbarment.  An issue of whether or not a
  deferred suspension constitutes "suspension" for the purpose of the employment contracts exists.  ODC suggests that
  the LSBA will issue a certificate of good standing to any attorney eligible to practice law in this state.  The
  certification would mean that the attorney is not disbarred, on active suspension, on inactive status, or on interim
  suspension.  An attorney serving a fully deferred suspension and otherwise in compliance with bar membership
  requirements would be considered "in good standing."  Further, Chief Counsel for the 15<sup>th</sup> JDC Public
  Defender Office, Mr. G. Paul Marx, in a letter to Mr. Register, states his opinion that a "deferred adjudication . .
  . in which there would be no finding and no suspension from practice . . . would have no effect on your Public
  Defender Contract."  Nevertheless, the committee determined that a public reprimand with the added conditions, was an
  appropriate sanction.</p>
