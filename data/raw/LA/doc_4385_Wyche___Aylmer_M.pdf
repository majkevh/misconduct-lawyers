<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA<br>
NO. 00-B-0029<br>
IN RE: AYLMER M. WYCHE,
III
</p>

<p class=HEADINGSTYLE></p>

<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>PER CURIAM<a href="#FN*">*</a></p>



<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from three counts of formal
charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) against
respondent, Aylmer M. Wyche, III, an attorney licensed to practice law in
Louisiana, but who is currently ineligible.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'></SPAN></p>



<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS<span></SPAN></h2>

<h3>Count I</h3>



<p class="Bodycopy">On September 20, 1996, this court
suspended respondent for a period of two years, with all but ninety days
deferred, for misconduct arising out of his handling of a succession
matter. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Wyche</i>, 96-1033 (La. 9/20/96), 
<a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=679%20So.2d%201335$3.0$p=">679 So. 2d 1335</a></span>.
Following the active portion of his suspension, respondent failed to comply
with the requirements of Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 23. Accordingly, he
remains ineligible to practice law.<span></SPAN></p>



<p class="Bodycopy">On February 9, 1998, respondent
appeared in open court on behalf of the plaintiff in the matter entitled
<span class="CITE"><i>Montgomery Ward Corp. v. Richard Partain</i>, Number 47428</span> on the docket of the
Bossier City Court, Judge Michael E. Daniel presiding. Following a hearing
on that date, Judge Daniel granted summary judgment in favor of the
plaintiff. Thereafter, the judge learned of respondent's ineligibility to
practice law. As a result, the judge set aside the judgment on his own
motion and filed a complaint with the ODC.<span></SPAN></p>



<p class="Bodycopy">During the investigation of the
complaint, respondent testified in a deposition that prior to the February 9,
1998 hearing date, he was contacted by Greg Eaton, a Baton Rouge attorney who
represented Montgomery Ward in the Partain case. Respondent explained
that Mr. Eaton needed &quot;someone&quot; to present a motion for summary
judgment to the Bossier City Court. Although another attorney in
respondent's office frequently handled such matters on Mr. Eaton's behalf, that
attorney was not available to attend the February 9 hearing; therefore,
respondent did so. Respondent testified that he &quot;didn't do any
argument&quot; and made no appearance in the case,<sup><a href="#FN1">1</a></sup> but simply
delivered the judgment Mr. Eaton had prepared. Respondent admitted that
he did respond on the record to the judge's questions concerning the
non-appearance of counsel for the defendant. </p>



<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent also admitted that he
did not bring to the judge's attention the fact that he was then ineligible to
practice law.<span></SPAN></p>

<h3>Count II</h3>



<p class="Bodycopy">Lee Ann Blaufuss retained respondent
to represent her in a redhibition case. Although respondent filed suit on
Ms. Blaufuss' behalf, the CDC alleges the suit was filed outside of the
prescriptive period.<sup><a href="#FN2">2</a></sup> Respondent failed to keep Ms. Blaufuss
informed concerning the status of the matter, and he misrepresented the status
of the case to her. Respondent also failed to inform Ms. Blaufuss of his
suspension from the practice of law.<span></SPAN></p>

<h3>Count III</h3>



<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent failed to cooperate in
the ODC's investigation of the complaints filed by Judge Daniel and Ms.
Blaufuss. Respondent failed to answer either of the complaints, and he
was twice subpoenaed to appear before the ODC. Respondent appeared
pursuant to one subpoena but failed to appear pursuant to the second.<span

<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'></SPAN></h2>

<h3>Formal Charges</h3>



<p class="Bodycopy">After its investigation, the ODC
filed formal charges against respondent, alleging his conduct violated Rules 
<a
href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id&id=RULE1"><SPAN class=rules>1.1</SPAN></a> (failure to provide competent representation to a
client), 
<a
href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id&id=RULE1"><SPAN class=rules>1.3</SPAN></a> (failure to act with diligence and promptness in
representing a client), 
<a
href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id&id=RULE1"><SPAN class=rules>1.4</SPAN></a> (failure to communicate with a client), 
<a
href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id&id=RULE5"><SPAN class=rules>5.5</SPAN></a> (unauthorized practice of law), 
<span class="Rules"><a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=RULE1.8$3.0$p=">8.1</a>(c)</span> (failure to
cooperate with the CDC in its investigation), <span class="Rules"> 
<a
href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id&id=RULE8">8.4</a>(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct),
<span class="Rules">
<a
href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id&id=RULE8">8.4</a>(b)</span> (commission of a criminal act reflecting
adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer),
<span class="Rules"> 
<a
href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id&id=RULE8">8.4</a>(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,
deceit, or misrepresentation), <span class="Rules"> 
<a
href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id&id=RULE8">8.4</a>(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the
administration of justice), and <span class="Rules"> 
<a
href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id&id=RULE8">8.4</a>(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its
investigation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'></SPAN></p>



<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent failed to answer or
otherwise respond to the formal charges. Accordingly, no formal hearing
was held, and the matter was submitted to the hearing committee solely on
documentary evidence.</p>

<h3><a target="hit" href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=99-DB-007.HC$3.0$p=">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></h3>



<p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the documentary
evidence submitted by the ODC, the hearing committee concluded that the record
clearly and convincingly demonstrates that respondent committed the misconduct
set forth in the formal charges.<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup></p>



<p class="Bodycopy">Turning to a discussion of an
appropriate sanction, the committee determined that a suspension is appropriate
for respondent's knowing, if not intentional, misconduct. As aggravating
factors, the committee found prior discipline,<sup><a name="4" href="#FN4">4</a></sup> pattern of
misconduct, failure to cooperate, vulnerability of the victim, and substantial
experience in the practice of law (admitted 1971). The committee found no
mitigating factors. Under these circumstances, the committee recommended
that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for three years.<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'></SPAN></p>



<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC
objected to the committee's recommendation.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'></SPAN></p>

<h3><a target="hit" href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=99-DB-007$3.0$p=">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>



<p class="Bodycopy">In its report, the disciplinary
board found that respondent violated duties owed to his clients, the public,
and the profession. The board also concurred in the hearing committee's
assessment of the aggravating factors. Relying on the ABA's <i>Standards</i>
<i>for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions<sup><a href="#FN5">5</a></sup> </i>and this court's opinion in
<span class="CITE"> <i>In
re: Scariano, 98-0532 </i>(La. 10/16/98), <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=719%20So.2d%20407$3.0$p=">719 So. 2d 407</a></span>,<sup><a name="6" href="#FN6">6</a></sup> the board
recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for three
years. The board further recommended that respondent be assessed with all
costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence
running thirty days from the date of finality of the court's judgment until
paid.<span></SPAN></p>



<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC
objected to the disciplinary board's recommendation.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'></SPAN></p>



<h2>DISCUSSION<span></SPAN></h2>



<p class="Bodycopy">The record supports the factual
findings of the hearing committee and disciplinary board. As to the
Partain matter, respondent was clearly ineligible to practice law, but he nevertheless
appeared in open court on behalf of a client and concealed his ineligibility to
practice from the trial judge. In the Blaufuss matter, respondent
neglected his client's case, and failed to keep her informed of the status of
the case. Finally, respondent failed to fully cooperate in the
disciplinary investigations of these matters, despite being admonished in the
past for similarly refusing to cooperate.<span></SPAN></p>



<p class="Bodycopy">Considering the numerous
aggravating factors present in this case, including respondent's prior
disciplinary record, and the lack of mitigating factors, we conclude a
three-year suspension from the practice of law is an appropriate sanction for
respondent's misconduct. Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary
board's recommendation and suspend respondent from the practice of law for
three years.<span></SPAN></p>



<h2>DECREE<span></SPAN></h2>



<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and
recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is
ordered that respondent be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for
a period of three years. All costs and expenses in the matter are
assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1,
with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this
court's judgment until paid.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><span>(<a name="FN*">FN*</a>) Knoll, J., not
on panel. Rule IV, Part 11, §
3.
</SPAN></p>

<p class="footnotetext"><span>(<a name="FN1">FN1</a>)<sup> </sup>The
court's minutes reflect that the &quot;plaintiff appeared through attorney, Al
Wyche.&quot;</SPAN></p>

<p class="footnotetext"><span>(<a name="FN2">FN2</a>) Based on
documents in the record, it appears the suit may have in fact been filed
timely. The suit record reveals that Ms. Blaufuss purchased her home (the
subject of the redhibition claim) on December 3, 1993. Respondent filed
suit on December 5, 1994, thus making it appear the one-year prescriptive date
had passed. However, December 3, 1994 was a Saturday, a legal
holiday. Therefore, under La. Code Civ. P. art. 5059,
respondent would have had until Monday, December 5, 1994 to file suit. In
any event, the suit record shows no activity in the case since an answer was filed
by the defendant on December 12, 1994.</SPAN></p>

<p class="footnotetext"><span>(<a name="FN3">FN3</a>) The committee
acknowledged that Ms. Blaufuss' redhibition claim may not be prescribed, as
charged in Count II of the formal charges. Nevertheless, the committee
found that respondent neglected the matter by allowing the suit to &quot;sit
idle&quot; for more than four years, and that he misrepresented the status of
the case to his client. Accordingly, the committee concluded respondent
violated the professional rules as charged</SPAN></p>

<p class="footnotetext"><span>(<a name="FN4">FN4</a>) In addition to
the suspension previously discussed, respondent was admonished in 1997 for
failing to cooperate in the ODC's investigation of a complaint filed against
him (<span class="CITE">97-ADB-025</span>). He was also admonished in 1993 for misconduct arising
out of his neglect of a domestic relations matter (<span class="CITE">93-ADB-054</span>).</SPAN></p>

<p class="footnotetext"><span>(<a name="FN5">FN5</a>) Standard 4.62
suggests that suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly
deceives a client and causes injury or potential injury. Under Standard
7.2, suspension is also appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct
that is a violation of a duty owed to the profession and which causes injury or
potential injury to a client, the public, or the legal system.</SPAN></p>

<p class="footnotetext"><span>(<a name="FN6">FN6</a>) In <i>Scariano</i>,
the respondent was retained to collect an unpaid promissory note. He
failed to timely file suit on his client's behalf, falsely misrepresented the
status of the case to his client, and failed to communicate with his
client. The respondent also failed to cooperate in the ODC's
investigation of the complaint filed against him. For his misconduct, the
respondent was suspended for three years.</SPAN></p>
