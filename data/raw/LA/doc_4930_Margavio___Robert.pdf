  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-1514</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: ROBERT MARGAVIO</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that
  respondent neglected a legal matter, which he handled as a private practice case against his employer's firm policy.
  Following the filing of formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent discipline, in
  which they stipulate that respondent's conduct violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (failure to act with
  reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), <span class="Rules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate
  with a client), <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span> (obligations upon termination of the representation), and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct. As a sanction, the parties propose respondent be suspended for a period of three
  years, with eighteen months deferred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having reviewed the petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Robert Margavio,
  Louisiana Bar Roll number 26987, be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of three years, with
  eighteen months deferred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
