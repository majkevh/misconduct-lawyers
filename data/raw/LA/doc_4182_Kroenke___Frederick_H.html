<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font>Respondent, Frederick H. Kroenke, Jr. was formally charged with engaging in misconduct contrary to the Rules of Professional Conduct.&nbsp; Count I charged respondent with failing to complete the representation of his client; failing to promptly disburse the funds entrusted to him; failing to promptly account for or return the funds and with commingling and converting his client's funds to his own use.&nbsp; The evidence shows respondent violated<font size="3"> </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15'></a>(a) and (b), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.16'></a>(d), and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a>(a) and (c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct<font size="3" color="#000000"> and </font><font size="3" color="#000000">. </font><font color="#000000"> Respondent filed a </font>Motion for Consent Discipline <font size="3" color="#000000">r</font><font color="#000000">equesting he be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year and one day with all of said suspension deferred, subject to completion of two years of supervised probation under the supervision of the Lawyers Assistance Program.&nbsp; Both the Disciplinary Counsel and the</font><font size="3" color="#000000"> </font><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A7a74?an=JD_96-DB-011 --##'><font size="3">Disciplinary Board</font></a><font size="3"></font><font size="3" color="#000000"> c</font><font color="#000000">oncurred with respondent's proposed Consent Discipline.</font><p>
<p><span class="BodyText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In recommending a totally deferred suspension, the Disciplinary Board found the following mitigating circumstances.&nbsp; The incident occurred when respondent's alcoholism was acute and had reached a crisis stage forcing him<font size="3"> </font>into recovery.&nbsp; According to the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, alcoholism is a mitigating factor when there is evidence the respondent suffered from chemical dependency that caused the misconduct.&nbsp; In this case, respondent's alcoholism caused his misconduct and his recovery from chemical dependency is demonstrated by a meaningful and sustained period of successful rehabilitation (since 1990).&nbsp; The recurrence of misconduct is unlikely.</span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The other mitigating factors cited by the Disciplinary Board included<font size="3"> </font>the absence of a prior disciplinary record, personal or emotional problems, timely good faith effort to make restitution and rectify the consequences of misconduct, full and free disclosure with the Disciplinary Board, delay in disciplinary proceeding, and remorse also justify a deferred suspension.&nbsp; Additionally, the Disciplinary Board concluded that while respondent should not have resorted to self-help, he was owed a substantial amount of legal fees that were never paid by respondents client in this case.&nbsp; The respondent has accepted full responsibility for his actions.&nbsp; He made repeated efforts at restitution and actually made restitution in an amount exceeding the amount he converted.</span></p>
