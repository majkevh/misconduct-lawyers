<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA<br>
NO. 98-B-0207.<br>
IN RE: ADAIR D. JONES<br>
</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>PER CURIAM. (FN*)</p>
<p>*************************************************************************************</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This disciplinary matter arises from one count of formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) against respondent, Adair D. Jones, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana.</p>
<p><span class="PlainText"><font face='Times New Roman'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The record indicates that respondent became ineligible to practice law on January 8, 1993 for failure to comply with mandatory CLE requirements.&nbsp; He was also placed on ineligibility status on September 6, 1995 for failure to pay his bar dues.<br>
</font>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The instant charges arise from two instances of unauthorized practice of law by&nbsp; respondent while he was on ineligible status.&nbsp; The first instance arose from the introduction of a deposition in </span><span class="CITE">Linda Ratcliff v. Dr. Robert Anderson, No. 397-246, </span><span class="PlainText">19th JDC for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, taken on April 15, 1996 by the respondent while he was ineligible to practice.&nbsp; Since respondent had already been admonished for engaging in the unauthorized practice of law in the Ratcliff litigation,</span><span class="CITE"> (FN1) J</span><span class="PlainText">udge Michael McDonald, the presiding judge, </span></p>
<p>immediately forwarded correspondence to the ODC enclosing a copy of the deposition.<br>
<span class="PlainText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The second instance arose from respondent's filing of a trial brief on April 3, 1996 in the case of </span><span class="CITE">Andrew Antoine v. Paul Parello, No. 410-097,</span><span class="PlainText"> 19th JDC for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, a matter in which he was an attorney of record.&nbsp; When the presiding&nbsp; judge, Judge William Brown, noted respondent was among one of the individuals listed on a roster of attorneys who were ineligible to practice, he wrote to the ODC advising of respondent's misconduct and provided a copy of the trial brief.<br>
</span><font face='Times New Roman'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On December 11, 1996, one count of formal charges was filed against respondent.&nbsp; The charges allege respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in violation of </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE5.5'></a>(a) and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a>(a), (d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. <font face='Times New Roman'> A formal hearing was conducted on March 24, 1997, and Judges Brown and McDonald each testified regarding respondent's misconduct in their respective courts.&nbsp; While respondent admitted that he knowingly engaged in the unauthorized practice of law when he prepared the trial brief, he asserted he believed he was a target of selected prosecution by the ODC.<br>
</font><span class="PlainText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Ac7a9?an=JD_HC9689 --##'>On May 7, 1997, the hearing committee issued its findings</a> concluding respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.&nbsp; While trying on A.B.A. Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, Standards 7.2 and 8.2, it concluded the baseline sanction was suspension.&nbsp; As such, it recommended respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months, with certain conditions. </span><span class="CITE">(FN2)<br>
</span><span class="PlainText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A7505?an=JD_96-DB-089 --##'>The disciplinary board concurred in the findings of the committee </a>that respondent was guilty of the misconduct set forth in the charges.&nbsp; While the board found no factors in mitigation to be present, it noted the presence of several aggravating factors:&nbsp; (1) prior disciplinary offenses; </span><span class="CITE">(FN3)</span><span class="PlainText">&nbsp; (2) pattern of misconduct;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; multiple offenses;&nbsp; (4) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct;&nbsp; (5) substantial experience in the practice of law; </span><span class="CITE">(FN4) </span><span class="PlainText"> (6) indifference to making restitution;&nbsp; and (7) vulnerability of the victims.&nbsp; The board recommended respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year and one day, with six months deferred, and reinstatement subject to the payment of fees and mandatory continuing legal education requirements articulated by the&nbsp; committee.&nbsp; </span><p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Further, it proposed respondent be placed on probation for a period of one year in the event of his reinstatement and remain current on his bar monetary obligations and continuing legal education requirements.&nbsp; Should respondent fail to comply with the terms of his probation, the board recommended it have the authority to modify or extend the terms of probation or seek probation revocation.&nbsp; One member of the board filed a concurrence to the board's recommendation.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither the respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the board's recommendation in this court.<br>
<span class="PlainText"><font face='Times New Roman'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and the record filed herein, it is the decision of the court that the disciplinary board's recommended sanction be adopted.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accordingly, it is ordered that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year and one day, with six months deferred.&nbsp; It is further ordered that following the active portion of his suspension, respondent shall be placed on probation for a period of one year and remain current on the payment of his bar dues, assessment fees and continuing legal education requirements, as well as comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct.&nbsp; In the event respondent fails to comply with these conditions of probation, the </p>
<p>disciplinary board is authorized to modify or extend the probationary period, or to recommend to&nbsp; this court that the probation be revoked and the deferred portion of the suspension be made executory.&nbsp; In addition to all other requirements under <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s23'></a> respondent is also ordered to file written proof that he has paid all applicable dues and fees and complied with his MCLE requirements prior to reinstatement.</p>
