<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 02-B-1377</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: PAMELA VINEY MATHEWS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<h2>PER CURIAM</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from one count of formal 
charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, 
Pamela Viney Matthews, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">In March, 1999, Brenda Eaton retained respondent to complete 
a partition of community property.<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> At that time, Ms. Eaton 
paid respondent an advance fee of&nbsp; $1,500. Ms. Eaton had no further contact 
with respondent until August, 2000, when she received a written request from 
respondent requesting payment of $36.30 in court costs. Ms. Eaton paid this 
amount to respondent, and respondent had the partition matter set for hearing on 
November 6, 2000.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Thereafter, Ms. Eaton made several attempts to contact 
respondent for information about the status of her case, but was unsuccessful.<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> 
Respondent failed to&nbsp; appear for the November 6, 2000 hearing. On November 
16, 2000, Ms. Eaton learned that respondent’s office telephone was disconnected 
and her office was closed.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On November 30, 2000, Ms. Eaton filed a complaint with the 
ODC. The ODC forwarded a copy of this complaint to respondent, but it was 
returned unclaimed. The ODC then personally served respondent with a subpoena 
compelling her to appear before the ODC for deposition. Respondent failed to 
appear.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed one count of formal 
charges. The charges alleged respondent’s actions violated the following 
provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.3 --#">1.3</a></span> (failure to act with reasonable 
diligence); <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.4 --#">1.4</a></span> 
(failure to communicate with client); <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.5 --#">1.5</a>(f)(6)</span> (failure to refund unearned 
fee); <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.16 --#">1.16</a>(d)</span> 
(failure to protect client interests upon termination of representation;
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE3.2 --#">3.2</a></span> (failure to 
expedite litigation); <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE3.4 --#">3.4</a></span> 
(failure to obey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal),
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.1 --#">8.1</a>(c)</span> (failure to 
cooperate in a disciplinary investigation); <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(a)</span> (violation of Rules of 
Professional Conduct); <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(c)</span> 
(conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); 8.4(g) 
(failure to cooperate with the ODC).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent failed to file an answer. Accordingly, the matter 
was submitted to the hearing committee on documentary evidence only.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-044.HC --#">Recommendation of the Hearing Committee</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee determined the ODC proved the formal 
charges by clear and convincing evidence. In determining an appropriate 
sanction, the committee looked to <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Bivins</i>, 
98-2513 (La. 12/11/98), <a href="#!-- #ID:724%20So.2d%20198 --#">724 So. 2d 198</a></span>, 
in which this court suspended an attorney for one year and one day for failing 
to communicate, failing to account for and refund unearned fees and for 
abandoning her law practice. The committee determined that respondent’s conduct 
in the instant case was more detrimental to the interests of the client than the 
conduct at issue in Bivins and warranted a longer suspension. Accordingly, the 
committee recommended respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a 
period of eighteen months.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-044.BD --#">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board determined the record supported the 
finding that respondent failed to use reasonable diligence, failed to 
communicate with Ms. Eaton, failed to appear at trial, failed to return an 
unearned fee or provide an accounting, failed to properly terminate her 
representation of Ms. Eaton and protect her interests and failed to cooperate 
with the ODC. However, the board found no evidence that respondent engaged in 
conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation, and therefore 
declined to find a violation of Rule 8.4(c).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Citing Standard 4.42(a), Standard 6.22 and Standard 7.2 of 
the ABA’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions,<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> the 
disciplinary board found the baseline&nbsp; sanction for respondent’s misconduct 
was a suspension. As aggravating factors, it found respondent had a prior 
disciplinary history,<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> had committed multiple offenses&nbsp; 
and engaged in bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary process by 
intentionally failing to cooperate with the ODC. Additionally, it found 
respondent’s client was a vulnerable victim and that respondent had substantial 
experience in the practice of law, having been admitted to the bar in 1991. The 
board determined the record did not support any mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Like the committee, the board agreed that this case was more 
egregious than Bivens. In support, it noted the instant case involved additional 
misconduct, including failure to expedite litigation, failure to appear on the 
day of trial and failure to cooperate. Moreover, it pointed out that unlike 
Bivens, there were no mitigating factors in the instant case. Under these 
circumstances, the board recommended respondent be suspended from the practice 
of law for a period of eighteen months. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this 
court to the recommendation of the disciplinary board.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original 
jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V, § 5(B). Consequently, we act as 
triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine 
whether the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence.
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94),
<a href="#!-- #ID:646%20So.2d%20343 --#">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>;
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Boutall</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:597%20So.2d%20444 --#">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">While we are not bound in any way by the findings and 
recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held 
the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee’s factual findings. 
See <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Caulfield</i>, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96),
<a href="#!-- #ID:683%20So.2d%20714 --#">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>;
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94),
<a href="#!-- #ID:633%20So.2d%20150 --#">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>. Based on our 
independent review, we conclude the findings of the hearing committee, as 
modified by the disciplinary board, are supported by the record. The undisputed 
evidence demonstrates that respondent failed to use reasonable diligence, failed 
to communicate with her client, failed to appear at trial, failed to return an 
unearned fee or provide an accounting, failed to properly terminate her 
representation of Ms. Eaton and protect her interests and failed to cooperate 
with the ODC.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional violations, we now turn to a 
determination of the appropriate sanction for this misconduct. The purpose of 
disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to 
maintain the appropriate standards of professional conduct, to preserve the 
integrity of the legal profession and to deter other lawyers from engaging in 
violations of the standards of the profession. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: 
Vaughan</i>, 00-1892 (La. 10/27/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:772%20So.2d%2087 --#">772 
So. 2d 87</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Lain</i>, 00-0148 (La. 
5/26/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:760%20So.2d%201152 --#">760 So. 2d 1152</a></span>;
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Levy</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:400%20So.2d%201355 --#">400 So. 2d 1355</a> (La. 1981)</span>. 
The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the 
seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and 
mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Redd</i>, 95-1472 (La. 
9/15/95), <a href="#!-- #ID:660%20So.2d%20839 --#">660 So. 2d 839</a></span>;
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent’s conduct caused actual harm to her client by 
delaying her legal matter and possibly impairing her substantive rights.<a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> 
Respondent’s failure to&nbsp; cooperate with the ODC caused harm to the legal 
system by requiring the ODC to expend additional time and resources to 
investigate this matter. The baseline sanction for this misconduct is a 
suspension.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Several aggravating factors are present, the most 
significant of which is respondent’s prior disciplinary history of two 
admonitions for strikingly similar conduct. We are unable to discern any 
mitigating factors from the record. Considering the facts, we conclude the 
eighteen-month suspension recommended by the disciplinary board is appropriate. 
Additionally, we will order respondent to make a full accounting to her client 
and refund any unearned fees.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the 
disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that Pamela Viney 
Mathews be suspended from the practice of law for a period of eighteen months. 
It is further ordered that respondent render a full accounting to her client and 
refund any unearned fees. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed 
against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal 
interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s 
judgment until paid.</p>
<hr>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> The partition of the acquets and 
gains had already been heard by the district court. Ms.&nbsp; Eaton’s previous 
attorney had entered into a stipulation with Ms. Eaton’s former husband 
regarding several assets, including her former husband’s retirement plan, which 
was conveyed to him in its entirety under the stipulation. After Ms. Eaton hired 
respondent, respondent filed pleadings asserting that Ms. Eaton was entitled to 
a share of the retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> Ms. Eaton made several appointments 
to speak with respondent, but respondent canceled each appointment.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> Standard 4.42(a) provides that 
suspension is appropriate when the lawyer knowingly fails to&nbsp; perform 
services for the client and causes injury or potential injury. Standard 6.22 
provides suspension is appropriate when the lawyer violates a court order and 
causes injury or potential injury to a client. Standard 7.2 provides suspension 
is appropriate when the lawyer violates a professional duty and causes injury or 
potential injury to a client, the public or the legal system.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> Respondent has been admonished on 
two occasions for conduct similar to that in the instant case. In
<span class="CITE">00-ADB-002</span>, she was admonished for lack of diligence, 
failure to expedite litigation and failure to cooperate with the ODC. In
<span class="CITE">97-ADB-043</span>, she was admonished for failure to 
cooperate with the ODC. In addition, she has been ineligible to practice law 
since September 4, 2001, based on her failure to pay her bar dues and 
disciplinary assessment.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">5</a> On November 13, 2000, the trial 
court signed a judgment on the partition, which presumably was consistent with 
the parties’ earlier stipulation. See note 1, supra. At some point, Ms. Eaton 
retained new counsel and filed a motion to re-set the November 6, 2000 hearing 
on the community property partition. In response, Ms. Eaton’s former husband 
filed an exception of <i>res judicata</i>, asserting that the matter had been 
resolved by the November 13, 2000 judgment. The record does not indicate the 
disposition of this exception.</p>
