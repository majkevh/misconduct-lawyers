<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: ALBERT L. BOUDREAU, JR.</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM </p>
<p>
</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary 
matter arises from one count of formal charges filed by the Office of 
Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Albert L. Boudreau, Jr., an 
attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana but who is currently on interim 
suspension.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">On October 14, 
1998, a federal grand jury sitting in the Western District of Louisiana returned 
an indictment charging respondent with thirteen counts of various violations of 
the child pornography laws. The indictment alleged that respondent smuggled into 
the United States several magazines and one videotape containing child 
pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 545 (Count I); received child 
pornography in interstate commerce in violation of
<a target="_blank" href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/2252.html">18 
U.S.C. § 2252</a>A(a)(2)(A) (Counts II-XI); possessed child pornography in 
violation of
<a target="_blank" href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/2252.html">18 
U.S.C. § 2252</a>A(a)(5)(B) (Count XII); and conspired to sexually exploit 
children in violation of
<a target="_blank" href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/2252.html">18 
U.S.C. § 2251</a>(a) and (d) (Count XIII). On February 9, 1999, respondent 
pleaded guilty to smuggling and possessing magazines containing child 
pornography (Counts I and XII), both felonies under federal law. In exchange for 
respondent’s guilty plea, the government dismissed the remaining counts of the 
indictment.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The factual basis 
of the plea indicates that while respondent was traveling in Europe in late 
1996, he purchased several magazines containing child pornography. These 
magazines depict “boys under the age of eighteen, but over the age of 12 and 
pubescent, engaged in sexually explicit conduct.” Respondent admitted to 
smuggling three such magazines (“Boys Nin Ihrer Freizeit,” “Megaboys 5,” and 
“Best of Wonderboy”) into the United States, knowing that it is illegal to bring 
them into the country. The magazines were discovered in respondent’s home in 
December 1997, during the execution of a search warrant by the U.S.&nbsp; 
Customs Service.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The district court 
subsequently fined respondent $1,000 and sentenced him to serve twenty-one 
months in prison,<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn1"><font size="1">1</font></a></span> 
followed by three years of supervised release subject to special conditions. </p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">On May 28, 1999, 
this court placed respondent on interim suspension based upon his conviction of 
a serious crime and ordered that disciplinary proceedings be instituted.
<span class="CITE"> <i>In 
re: Boudreau</i>, 99-0689 (La. 5/28/99), <a href="#!-- ID:737%20So.2d%2023 --">737 So. 2d 23</a></span>. On June 15, 1999, the 
ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent arising out of his 
conviction. The disciplinary proceedings were then stayed pending the finality 
of the criminal proceedings. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After respondent’s 
sentencing in February 2000, but while his appeal was still pending, the ODC 
moved to have the formal charges set for a hearing. Because respondent was by 
this time incarcerated in a federal prison in Texas, he was granted until April 
24, 2000 to file an answer to the formal charges. However, no answer was filed 
on respondent’s behalf. Accordingly, pursuant to <span class="AllRules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s11E --#">11</a>(E)(3)</span>, the formal charges were deemed 
admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence. No formal hearing was 
held, but the parties were given an opportunity to file written arguments and 
documentary evidence with the hearing committee on the issue of sanctions.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In its submission, 
the ODC argued that respondent has been convicted of a serious crime warranting 
discipline under Rule <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(b)</span> of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on the 
lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer). Pointing to recent 
jurisprudence from this court in matters involving sexual misconduct by 
attorneys, the ODC contended the baseline sanction for respondent’s misconduct 
is disbarment. The ODC suggested several aggravating factors are present, 
including pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, vulnerability of the 
victims, and substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted 1965). The 
only mitigating factor identified by the ODC is the absence of a prior 
disciplinary record. Finding there is no reason to deviate downward from the 
baseline sanction, the ODC recommended respondent be disbarred from the practice 
of law.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In respondent’s 
submission, he admitted his conviction but argued that numerous mitigating 
factors warrant a sanction less harsh than disbarment. In particular, respondent 
mentioned his cooperation in the federal criminal proceedings and the fact that 
he has been retired from the practice of law since 1995, before the acts forming 
the basis of the criminal charges. Respondent also pointed out that the 
magazines he possessed are legal in Europe, where they were purchased, and that 
the subjects of the photographs in the magazines were of legal age to be 
photographed nude in the Netherlands, where the magazines were produced. 
However, contrary to respondent’s admission in the federal district court that 
the magazines depict “boys under the age of eighteen, but over the age of 12 and 
pubescent, engaged in sexually explicit conduct,” he argued to the hearing 
committee that the magazines do not show “any sex acts of any kind by any of the 
subjects. They were simply nude photographs.” Respondent further argued that he 
“has suffered enough for offenses which are highly questionable under the 
Constitution of the United States and the freedoms it guarantees to all 
citizens.” Based on this reasoning, respondent urged the committee to consider 
an indefinite suspension from the practice of law.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-052.HC --#">Hearing Committee 
Recommendation </a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After considering 
the submissions of the parties, the hearing committee agreed that respondent 
violated Rule <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a></span>(b) by committing criminal 
acts which reflect adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a 
lawyer. The committee noted that it was “not impressed” with the mitigating 
circumstances cited by respondent, and accordingly, concurred in the ODC’s 
recommendation of disbarment. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent 
nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee’s recommendation.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn2"><font size="1">2</font></a></span>
</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-052.BD --#">Disciplinary Board 
Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing 
the record, the disciplinary board found the hearing committee’s findings of 
fact are not manifestly erroneous, and that the committee correctly applied the 
Rules of Professional Conduct. The board found respondent intentionally violated 
duties owed to the public and the profession by participating in the sexual 
exploitation of children. The board noted respondent supported “an industry that 
capitalizes on the degradation of children, which serves only to demoralize our 
society and damage children.” It reasoned that because respondent is a lawyer 
and an officer of the court, his “blatant disregard of laws meant to protect 
those most vulnerable, children, is a stain upon the legal profession and 
dishonors every lawyer’s effort to uphold the law.”&nbsp; The board determined 
the baseline sanction for respondent’s conduct is disbarment. The only 
mitigating factor found by the board was the absence of a prior disciplinary 
record. It found several aggravating factors were present, namely multiple 
offenses, vulnerability of the victims, substantial experience in the practice 
of law, and illegal conduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In light of these 
findings and the prior jurisprudence in matters involving sexual misconduct by 
attorneys,<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn3"><font size="1">3</font></a></span> 
the board concluded there is insufficient justification for a departure from the 
baseline sanction. Accordingly, the board recommended respondent be disbarred. 
The board also recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and 
expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty 
days from the date of finality of the court’s judgment until paid.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Neither respondent nor the ODC 
filed an objection in this court to the disciplinary board’s recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">It is undisputed 
that respondent pleaded guilty to entering the United States with magazines 
containing child pornography and to possessing those magazines in violation of 
federal law making it a crime to knowingly possess “any book, magazine, 
periodical, film, videotape, computer disk, or any other material that contains 
an image of child pornography . . .”<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn4"><font size="1">4</font></a></span> 
Respondent’s guilt of these two crimes has been conclusively established by 
virtue of his guilty plea.<span style="vertical-align: super"><font size="1"><a href="#fn5">5</a></font></span> 
Accordingly, the sole issue presented is whether respondent’s crimes warrant 
discipline and, if so, the extent thereof. <span class="AllRules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s19E --#">19</a>(E)</span>; <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. 
Wilkinson</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:562%20So.2d%20902 --#">562 So. 2d 902</a> (La. 
1990)</span>. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent’s 
conviction clearly reflects upon his moral fitness to practice law. We conclude 
the baseline sanction for his misconduct is disbarment. The sole mitigating 
factor present is respondent’s lack of a prior disciplinary record. By contrast, 
several aggravating factors are present: multiple offenses, vulnerability of the 
victims, substantial experience in the practice of law, and illegal conduct. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Under these 
circumstances, we see no reason to deviate from the baseline sanction. 
Accordingly, we will accept the recommendation of the disciplinary board and 
disbar respondent from the practice of law. </p>
<p align="center"><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the 
findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, and 
considering the record, it is ordered that the name of Albert L. Boudreau, Jr. 
be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in 
the State of Louisiana be revoked. All costs and expenses in the matter are 
assessed against respondent in accordance with <span class="AllRules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s10.1 --#">10.1</a></span>, with legal interest to commence thirty 
days from the date of finality of this court’s judgment until paid.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<hr color="#000000" align="left" width="100" size="1">
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> The twenty-one month sentence was imposed by the federal 
district court on February 9, 2000, following a determination that downloaded 
computer images of child pornography which were not the subject of respondent’s 
conviction were sufficient to enhance his sentence by two levels under the 
federal sentencing guidelines. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth 
Circuit thereafter reversed the enhancement of respondent’s sentence on that 
basis. <span class="CITE">United States v. Boudreau, 250 F.3d 279 (5th Cir. 2001)</span>. The effect of 
the Fifth Circuit’s decision was to reduce the applicable offense level under 
the sentencing guidelines from Level 16 (21-27 months incarceration) to Level 14 
(15-21 months incarceration). In June 2001, on remand from the court of appeal 
for re-sentencing, the district court again imposed a twenty-one month sentence.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> Respondent did, however, file a motion with the 
disciplinary board seeking a remand of the matter so that “new evidence,” namely 
the Fifth Circuit’s opinion, could be introduced. After consideration, the board 
denied respondent’s motion for remand, reasoning that the fact of respondent’s 
guilty plea was not affected by the Fifth Circuit’s opinion.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> The board cited <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Touchet</i>, 99-3125 (La. 
2/4/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:753%20So.2d%20820 --#">753 So. 2d 820</a></span> (attorney 
disbarred for making unwanted sexual demands on six female clients and 
soliciting sexual favors in lieu of legal fees), and <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Plaisance</i>, 
98-0345 (La. 3/13/98), <a href="#!-- #ID:706%20So.2d%20969 --#">706 So. 2d 969</a></span> 
(attorney consented to be disbarred for attempting to videotape female employees 
in his law firm's restroom without their knowledge). </p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> The term “child pornography” is defined in
<a target="_blank" href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/2256.html">18 
U.S.C. § 2256</a>(8) to mean “any visual depiction, including any photograph, 
film, video, picture, or computer or computer generated image or picture, 
whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually 
explicit conduct, where (A) the production of such visual depiction involves the 
use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; (B) such visual depiction 
is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; (C) such 
visual depiction has been created, adapted, or modified to appear that an 
identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or (D) such visual 
depiction is advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such 
a manner that conveys the impression that the material is or contains a visual 
depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.”</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">5</a> This fact precludes any attempt by respondent to argue in 
mitigation that he simply possessed “magazines with pictures of nude boys (in 
poses like the statue of David by Michelangelo which stands in Florence, Italy — 
none were engaged in any sexual acts!).” Clearly, an essential element of the 
crime of which respondent was convicted is that the magazines depict a minor 
engaged in “sexually explicit conduct.” That term is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 
2256(2) to mean “actual or simulated (A) sexual intercourse, including 
genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between 
persons of the same or opposite sex; (B) bestiality; (C) masturbation; (D) 
sadistic or masochistic abuse; or (E) lascivious exhibition of the genitals or 
pubic area of any person.” Based upon this definition, we cannot fathom that the 
photographs respondent possessed could be mistaken for museum-quality art.</p>
