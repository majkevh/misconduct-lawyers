  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE:JAMES E. BURKS</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 00-DB-125</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a Joint Petition for Consent Discipline
  by the Respondent, James E. Burks ("Respondent"), of Lake Charles, Louisiana, and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") prior to the filing of formal charges. The Board accepts the Petition and orders a public reprimand be issued
  against Respondent. </p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On October 3, 2000, Respondent and ODC filed a Joint Petition for Consent Discipline. On the same
  day, the parties filed a stipulation of facts and memorandum in support of the proposed sanction. Formal charges have
  not been filed in this matter. On January 25, 2001, a panel of the Disciplinary Board heard oral arguments and
  reviewed the documents filed in this matter. Deputy Disciplinary Counsel James T. Daly represented ODC. James Spruel,
  Jr. appeared on behalf of the Respondent.</p>

  <h2>FACTUAL BACKGROUND </h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The record, including the stipulation of facts, reveals the following information. Respondent was
  served with a complaint filed by Katherine L. Thomas on October 4, 1999.He failed to respond to the complaint in
  writing as required. A subpoena then was served upon him to obtain his sworn statement. He provided his statement and
  from thereon cooperated fully with the investigation of the matter. During the course of the investigation,
  Respondent completed the succession that was the source of the complaint. ODC states that it has received no further
  communication from the complainant since the completion of the succession. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In another matter, Loretta Evans, a widow of Respondent's client, Willie Evans, filed a
  complaint. Respondent had accepted the representation of Mr. Evans in a medical malpractice case that had already
  been handled by two prior attorneys. Upon accepting representation, Respondent had the medical records reviewed by an
  expert witness. The resulting report did not support the malpractice claim. At this same time, Respondent experienced
  difficulty in getting a medical review panel set up to review the claim.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" class="fn"
  id="_ednref1">[i]</a> As a result, the case never went before the panel. Subsequently, the client died.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent claims, but cannot prove, that he kept Mr. Evans informed about his case, that Mr.
  Evans understood the problems and accepted the outcome. Mrs. Evans filed the complaint approximately four years after
  the last action on the case. Respondent cooperated in the investigation of this complaint.<b> </b></p>

  <h2>PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> In the joint petition, the parties submit that Respondent's misconduct in the above two
  instances constitutes violations of Rules of Professional Conduct <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (failure to act with
  reasonable diligence), <span class="Rules">1.4(a)</span> (failure to keep a client reasonably informed and promptly
  comply with reasonable requests for information), <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span>(failure to cooperate). Respondent tenders a conditional admission to the
  misconduct, and the parties propose that a sanction of public reprimand be imposed.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rules 1.3, 1.4(a), 8.1(c), and 8.4(g)
  of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The Board must accept that Respondent has violated these rules.
  <i><span class="cite">In re Lieberman</span></i><span class="cite">, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96);
  <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given the violations of these rules, the Board is
  left to determine if the proposed sanction of public reprimand is appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors: </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1)whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system,
    or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted"> (2)whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3)the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and </p>

    <p class="inverted">(4)the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The record in this matter supports a finding that Respondent knowingly violated duties owed to
  his client and to the profession. However, the record fails to provide any solid proof of any harm to Respondent's
  clients. At most, harm to the clients here is minimal-Mr. Evans' case was unsupported by the medical evidence
  submitted to the expert, and Ms. Thomas' succession matter was ultimately completed.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mitigating factors include <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest motive</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>, and a <span class="ABAstandard">good faith effort to rectify the
  consequences of misconduct</span>. Aggravating factors include <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary
  offenses</span> <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn" id="_ednref2">[ii]</a> and
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span> <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"
  class="fn" id="_ednref3">[iii]</a>.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <h3><b>I.</b> ABA Standards</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanction</i>
  (herein "Standard") to determine the baseline sanction by "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's mental state and
  the extent of the injury caused; and then adjust the sanction in accordance with the aggravating and mitigating
  factors present." <span class="cite"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94);
  <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 350</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The proposed sanction is in line with the ABA guidelines. Under A.B.A. Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span>, a "reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent and does not
  act with reasonable diligence in representing a client, and causes injury or potential injury to the client. "Under
  Standard <span class="ABAstandard">7.3</span>, a "reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer negligently
  engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional, and causes injury or potential injury to a
  client, the public, or the legal system."</p>

  <h3><b>II.</b> Relevant Case Law</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board also looks to relevant case law for assistance in determining an appropriate sanction
  for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The case of <span class="cite"><i>In re Laiche</i>,
  <a href="1999-07-15_98-DB-057.htm">98-DB-057</a></span>, offers guidance here. In <i>Laiche</i>, formal charges were
  filed against the respondent consisting of five counts that alleged violations of Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3,
  1.4(a)(b), 1.16(d), 8.1(c) and 8.4(g).After the respondent admitted to violating Rules 1.3, 1.4 and l.16 (d), the
  parties later filed a joint motion for consent discipline proposing a public reprimand as the appropriate discipline.
  <i>Bd. Op</i>. at 1.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Count I of the formal charges brought against Laiche alleged that the respondent filed suit on
  behalf of his clients in a personal injury matter but did little more to move the case forward over the next eight
  years, in violation of Rule 1.3.Count II of the charges alleged that Laiche failed to keep his clients informed as to
  the progress or lack of progress of the case, in violation of Rule 1.4(a).The other pertinent counts alleged that the
  respondent failed to timely inform his clients of a settlement offer, which he rejected without consulting his
  clients, and failed to return a file and to timely sign a motion to substitute counsel to clients who had discharged
  him.<i>Id</i>. at 1.-2. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The only aggravating factor was respondent's substantial experience in the practice of law.
  Mitigating factors included the absence of a disciplinary record, no dishonest or selfish motive and a timely good
  faith effort to rectify the misconduct. <i>Id.</i> at 2.The Board accepted the joint petition, ordering that the
  respondent receive a public reprimand and that he be assessed with all costs and expenses of the proceedings. In
  reaching its determination, the Board emphasized the fact that the clients did not suffer any actual harm.<i>Id.</i>
  at 3. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Another cases that lends guidance here is <span class="cite"><i>In re Brown</i>,
  <a href="../SC/2000-06-13_00-DB-047.htm">00-DB-047</a></span>.In that case, the respondent was issued a public
  reprimand for violations of Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3 and 1.4(a).There, the respondent received the file of a
  client from his former associate who had been handling the matter for several years. Although the client was notified
  in writing of the transfer of the file, the respondent did nothing substantive to move the matter forward or to keep
  the client informed as to the status of the case for over a year. The only aggravating factor present was the
  substantial experience in the practice of law. The absence of a prior disciplinary record was cited as a mitigating
  factor. <i>Bd. Op</i>. at 2-3.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC cites several cases in support of the consent discipline, including the case of
  <span class="cite"><i>In re</i> <i>Ruddick</i>, <a href="0000-00-00_94-DB-060.htm">94-DB-060</a></span>. In
  <i>Ruddick</i>, formal charges were filed against the respondent alleging violations of Rules of Professional Conduct
  1.3, 1.4, 1.16 and 8.4(g).There, the respondent failed to provide his clients with a status reports regarding a
  succession matter, neglected to complete the succession and failed to communicate with his clients. He also failed to
  return documents to the clients and failed to remit an unearned fee. The respondent also failed to respond to
  inquiries from ODC concerning the clients' complaint. Prior to the hearing scheduled in the matter, the respondent
  filed a motion for consent discipline requesting that he receive a public reprimand for his misconduct. <i>Bd.
  Op</i>. at pp. 1-2.ODC concurred, and the Board approved the discipline. Mitigating factors included no prior
  disciplinary record and personal problems.Aggravating factors included multiple offenses and substantial experience
  in the practice of law.<i>Id</i>. at 3-4.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC also cites the case of <span class="cite"><i>In re Dolbear</i>,
  <a href="1999-02-24_98-DB-061.htm">98-DB-061</a></span>, in support of the sanction. In that case, the respondent was
  retained in a matter involving four imprisoned Mexican nationals and accepted money to obtain their release. He
  agreed to refund the money if he was unsuccessful. When he was unsuccessful, he failed to return the fee. In another
  matter, Dolbear agreed to review a file but failed to return it after the client decided not to retain him. He also
  failed to cooperate with ODC in its investigation of the complaints.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> The Board found that Dolbear negligently failed to act with reasonable diligence, negligently
  handled client property, and failed to cooperate with ODC. Numerous aggravating factors were cited by the Board,
  including prior misconduct, failure to cooperate, vulnerability of victim and substantial experience in the practice
  of law .The mitigating factor of absence of selfish motive was also noted. The respondent admitted that he violated
  Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.16(d), 8.1 and 8.4(a)(d)(g). The Board accepted the proposed consent
  discipline of a public reprimand .<i>Bd. Op</i>. at pp. 1-2.<i><u>See</u></i> <i><u>also</u></i>
  <span class="cite"><i>In re Taylor</i>, <a href="1997-02-07_96-DB-053.htm">96-DB-053</a></span> (public reprimand
  issued for respondent's violation of Rules 1.3, 1.4, 8.4(a) and 8.4(d)).</p>

  <h3><b>III.</b>Conclusion</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This matter is akin to the above-cited cases in that similar rule violations are present. The
  aggravating factor of substantial experience in the practice of law is present in all instances, save the
  <i>Taylor</i> matter. The mitigating factor of absence of dishonest motive is present as in <i>Laiche</i> and
  <i>Dolbear</i>, and the mitigating factor of good faith effort to rectify the consequences of the misconduct is
  present as in <i>Laiche</i>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Further, following the issuance of the subpoena in the Thomas matter, the Respondent did provide
  a sworn statement to ODC and from thereon cooperated fully with the investigation of the matter. Also, as previously
  noted, harm to the clients here is, at most, minimal.</p>
