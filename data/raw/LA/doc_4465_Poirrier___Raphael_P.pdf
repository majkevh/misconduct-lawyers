<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

<h3>Formal Charges</h3>



<p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed
formal charges under docket number 01-B-1116, stemming from the Barbier,
Johnson, Adams, Gradney  and Noyel
complaints.  The charges asserted
violations of Rules  (lack of diligence), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=RULE1.4 '></a>(failure to communicate), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=RULE1.5'></a>(f)(6)
(failure to refund unearned fees),  (failure
to properly withdraw from representation upon termination),  (failure to protect client interests upon
termination of the representation),  (failure to
expedite litigation),  (failure to cooperate
with the ODC in its investigation), 
(violating the Rules of Professional Conduct), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=RULE8.4'></a>(c)
(engaging in conduct involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or
misrepresentation),  (conduct prejudicial to
the administration of justice), and  (failure
to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) of the Rules of Professional
Conduct.</p>



<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed separate formal
charges, under docket number 01-B-1118, arising out of the Warner
complaint.  These formal charges
asserted violations of the following provisions of the Rules of Professional
Conduct: Rules  (scope of the
representation),  (lack of diligence), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=RULE1.4'></a> (failure to communicate), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=RULE1.5'></a>(f)(6)
(failure to refund unearned fees),  (failure
to properly withdraw from representation upon termination), (failure to protect client interests upon
termination of the representation),  (failure to
expedite litigation),  (failure to comply
with tribunal orders),  (failure to cooperate
with the ODC in its investigation), 
(violating the Rules of Professional Conduct), 
(engaging in conduct involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or
misrepresentation),  (conduct prejudicial to
the administration of justice), and  (failure
to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation). </p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent failed to file answers to either set of formal
charges.  Accordingly, the matters were submitted to separate
hearing committees on documentary evidence only.
<span class="AllRules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=r19s11'>11</a>(E)(3)</span>.Respondent failed to submit evidence or
argument for consideration.</p>



<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-032.HC --#">Recommendation of the Hearing Committee
(01-B-1116)</a></h3>



<p class="Bodycopy">After considering the evidence
submitted by the ODC on the Barbier, Johnson, Adams, Gradney and Noyel
complaints, the hearing committee found these charges were proven by clear and
convincing evidence.  The committee
determined that respondent knowingly and intentionally violated duties to his
clients, the profession, and the legal system, and that respondent’s actions
resulted in actual harm to his clients. 
 Specifically, the committee found respondent’s clients were wrongfully
deprived of their funds and that some may have lost the right to pursue their
claims.    Relying on the ABA’s <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn3" name="_ednref3" class="fn" href="#_edn3">2</a>
the committee concluded disbarment or suspension is the baseline sanction.  The committee noted as aggravating factors
the presence of dishonest or selfish motive, pattern of misconduct, multiple
offenses, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary process by intentionally
failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, refusal to
acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, and indifference to making
restitution.  In mitigation, the
committee noted the absence of a prior disciplinary record.<span>  </span>After further considering jurisprudence from
this court,<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn4" name="_ednref4" class="fn" href="#_edn4">3</a></span></span>
the committee recommended respondent be disbarred from the practice of law, as
well as ordered to pay restitution to his clients as a condition to
readmission.</p>

<p><i></i></p>

<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-025.HC --#">Recommendation of Hearing Committee
(01-B-1118)</a></h3>



<p class="Bodycopy">This hearing committee considered
the charges arising out of the Warner matter, and concluded these formal
charges were proven by clear and convincing evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Turning to the question of the appropriate sanction, the
committee recommended that respondent be disbarred from the practice of law, as
well as ordered to provide a full accounting and restitution to Ms. Warner as
conditions to readmission.</p>



<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-025.BD --#">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></h3>



<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board considered
the recommendations of the hearing committees in 01-B-1116 and 01-B-1118
together.  Respondent appeared at the
board panel hearing and was given the opportunity to address the panel. <a name="_ednref5" class="fn" href="#_edn5">4</a></p>



<p class="Bodycopy">After consideration of the
evidence, the disciplinary board issued its written recommendation adopting the
findings of each of the committees in all respects.  Specifically, the board concluded respondent violated duties owed
to his clients by failing to account for and refund unearned fees, abandoning
his practice and clients, failing to expedite litigation, failing to
definitively end his client representations, and failing to withdraw from his
clients’ cases and return their files. 
Further, the board found respondent violated duties owed as a
professional and to the legal system by failing to pay dues, failing to keep
his registration statement current and ignoring the disciplinary process and
the orders that have been issued.  It
determined respondent acted knowingly and intentionally and caused actual
injury to his clients, the legal system, and the profession.</p>



<p class="Bodycopy">The board found the baseline
sanction for respondent’s misconduct was disbarment.   As aggravating factors, the board recognized the presence of
dishonest or selfish motive, pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, and bad
faith obstruction of the disciplinary process by intentionally failing to
comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency. <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn6" name="_ednref6" class="fn" href="#_edn6">5</a>
 Accordingly, the board found no reason
to deviate from the baseline sanction of disbarment.  The board further recommended respondent return his clients’
files and provide a full accounting and restitution to all of his clients.</p>



<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC
objected to the disciplinary board’s recommendation.</p>



<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>



<p class="Bodycopy">The record supports the finding
that respondent knowingly and intentionally failed to communicate with his
clients, neglected his clients’ legal matters, abandoned his clients and his
law practice, failed to expedite his clients’ litigation, failed to account for
or refund unearned fees and/or unused costs to his clients, failed to return
his clients’ files, and failed to cooperate with the ODC.  Therefore, the sole issue presented for our
consideration is the appropriate sanction for respondent’s misconduct.</p>



<p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate
sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain
high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the
profession, and deter future misconduct. 
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La.
1987)</span>.   The discipline to be imposed
depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses
involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating
circumstances.  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar
Ass’n v. Whittington</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>



<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent’s conduct caused actual
harm to his clients by depriving them of their funds for a substantial time and
jeopardizing their legal matters.  By
utterly abandoning his law practice without notice, respondent has demonstrated
he has little if any concern for the welfare of clients.   Likewise, his failure to cooperate in the numerous
disciplinary investigations displays an indifference to the practice of law and
has impaired the efficient operation of the disciplinary process, causing harm
to the legal profession as a whole. 
Numerous aggravating factors are present, including a pattern of
misconduct and failure to make (or even attempt to make) restitution to
clients.</p>



<p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the
recommendation of the disciplinary board and disbar respondent from the
practice of law.  We will further order
respondent to return his clients’ files and papers, as well as provide a full
accounting and refund of any unearned fees and unused costs to each of his
clients.</p>



<h2>DECREE</h2>



<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and
recommendations of the hearing committees and disciplinary board, and considering
the record, it is the decision of this court that the recommendation of the
disciplinary board be accepted. 
Accordingly, it is ordered that the name of Raphael P. Poirrier be
stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the
State of Louisiana be revoked.  
Further, respondent is ordered to return all files and papers belonging
to his clients, as well as ordered to provide complete accountings and full
restitution of any unearned fees and unused costs owed to his clients.  All costs and expenses in the matter are
assessed against respondent in accordance with <span class="AllRules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, § <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&id=r19s10.1'>10.1</a></span>, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the
date of finality of this court’s judgment until paid.</p>
