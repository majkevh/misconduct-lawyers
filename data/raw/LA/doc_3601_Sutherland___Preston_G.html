  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE PRESTON G. SUTHERLAND</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">02-DB-093</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">INTRODUCTION</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary matter arises out of Formal Charges consisting of one count filed by
  the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against Preston G. Sutherland ("respondent").  In the charges, it is
  alleged that the respondent violated Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3 (diligence) and 1.15(b) (safekeeping property)
  by failing to promptly pay chiropractic fees following the settlement of client claims.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Formal Charges were filed on September 6, 2002.  Respondent filed an Answer on October 31, 2002,
  denying that he violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged.  A hearing was conducted on February 19,
  2003.  The committee found misconduct and recommended that respondent be issued a public reprimand.  ODC filed a
  notice of no objection to the committee's report.  Respondent did not file a formal response.  The matter came for
  oral argument before a panel of the Board on August 28, 2003.  Robin D. Pittman appeared on behalf of the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel and the respondent appeared on his own behalf.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the record, evidence and argument, the Board adopts the report of the hearing
  committee with the modifications set forth below, and issues a public reprimand to the respondent.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Formal Charges read in pertinent part:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>You, Preston G. Sutherland, represented Shaela and Daniel Monjarres in a personal injury suit for an accident
    which occurred May 9, 1997.  You sent a letter of guarantee to Dr. Jafar Nassiri at Chiropractic Injury Rehab
    guaranteeing that you would protect Dr. Nassiri's fee from whatever settlement you obtained in the case in exchange
    for treatment of the Monjarres. Shaela Monjarres' treatment totaled $2,493.00 and Daniel Monjarres' treatment
    totaled $2,306.00.  Dr. Nassiri and his office made several requests for payment for treatment of your clients to
    no avail.  The Monjarres' case settled in August of 2000 and still no payment was rendered to Dr. Nassiri. </p>

    <p>On June 12, 2001, Dr. Nassiri wrote an ethical complaint to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel regarding your
    failure to pay the Monjarres' medical bills from their settlement.  On July 13, 2001, you rendered payment in the
    amount of $2,122.00 out-of-pocket and explained that your client was to negotiate directly with Dr. Nassiri's
    office for a reduction of their fees.  You advised that your client had instructed you to dispense the third-party
    medical provider's money directly to him and you assumed that there had been a successful compromise of Dr.
    Nassiri's fees and that the case was closed until you received this ethical complaint.  You have admitted to your
    conduct by stating, "I realize that I was mistaken in agreeing that the client negotiate Nassiri's fees without
    retaining those funds in my trust account."</p>

    <p>Therefore, based on your actions and admission, you had actual knowledge of Dr. Nassiri's interest in the
    Monjarres' settlement.  Further, you signed a personal letter guaranteeing payment of Dr. Nassiri's fee from
    whatever settlement you received but Dr. Nassiri did not receive payment until almost a year later due to your
    negligent misconduct. Your conduct has violated Rule <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> and
    <span class="allegedrules">1.15(b)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2><span class="CITE"><a href="../HC/2003-02-28_02-DB-093.htm">HEARING COMMITTEE REPORT</a></span></h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The committee found that respondent represented Shaela Monjarres and Daniel Monjarres, brother
  and sister, in a personal injury suit arising out of an automobile accident that occurred on May 9, 1997. Respondent
  wrote to the Chiropractic Injury and Rehab Group ("CIR"), where his clients were receiving treatment, on May 14,
  1997, and advised of his representation. In that letter he stated: "I am guaranteeing that I will protect your fee
  from whatever settlement I obtain in this matter."<a name="_ftnref1" class="fn" href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>
  Although respondent's letter of guarantee referred only to Sheala Monjarres, respondent admitted at the hearing that
  he intended for the letter to guarantee payment for both Shaela and Daniel Monjarres.<a name="_ftnref2" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Both claims were settled in August 2002.  Respondent disbursed the settlement funds to his
  clients without paying CIR. <a name="_ftnref3" class="fn" href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent testified that during the pendency of the tort claim a status conference was held and
  that State Farm's attorney appeared at the conference and told the judge that State Farm had conducted an audit and
  determined that CIR's charges ($2,493.00 owed by Sheala Monjarres and $2,306.00 owed by Daniel Monjarres) were beyond
  the "usual and customary" amounts charged by  health care providers who provide such services.  According to the
  respondent, the Judge indicated that she would only award the usual and customary amounts.<a name="_ftnref4"
  class="fn" href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent contacted CIR and attempted to obtain a reduction in the amount that would be
  accepted.<a name="_ftnref5" class="fn" href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a> When CIR refused to reduce the amount, and
  because Daniel Monjarres said that he would be in a better position to negotiate a reduction in fees, all of the
  funds were disbursed to Mr. Monjarres and his sister, so that he could undertake further negotiations and the
  responsibility for paying CIR's bill.<a name="_ftnref6" class="fn" href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a> The committee
  found respondent's testimony to be credible. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Monjarres, a merchant seaman, testified that he made several calls to the clinic which were
  not returned and therefore, he was unable to resolve the issue of the unpaid bills before CIR filed a complaint with
  ODC on June 12, 2001.<a name="_ftnref7" class="fn" href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee found that CIR made no attempt to communicate with respondent after the settlement
  had been reached and the funds disbursed.<a name="_ftnref8" class="fn" href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a>
  Respondent's first notice that his client had not paid the medical bills came in the form of the CIR complaint to
  ODC.<a name="_ftnref9" class="fn" href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a> Upon receipt of the complaint from ODC,
  respondent contacted CIR and was able to negotiate a settlement for $2,122.00, which was promptly paid on July 13,
  2001.<a name="_ftnref10" class="fn" href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a> Respondent and Mr. Monjarres testified
  that Mr. Monjarres would repay this amount to respondent.<a name="_ftnref11" class="fn" href="#_ftn11"
  id="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The committee declined to find a violation of Rule 1.3 (diligence) but found that respondent
  violated Rule 1.15(b) and (c) (safekeeping property).  It rejected respondent's argument that he made a "harmless
  mistake," pointing out that CIR was not paid until eleven months after the settlement funds had been disbursed. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As mitigating factors, the committee found that respondent has no prior disciplinary record in
  his twenty-six years of practice;<a name="_ftnref12" title="" href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a> made prompt
  restitution and paid CIR out of his own pocket, albeit after the filing of the complaint with ODC; cooperated fully
  with ODC's investigation; and, expressed remorse by stating that he was mistaken in agreeing that the client
  negotiate CIR's fees without retaining those funds in his trust account.<a name="_ftnref13" title="" href="#_ftn13"
  id="_ftnref13">[13]</a> The committee found no aggravating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">While the committee expressed its belief that respondent did not act maliciously, nor with any
  intent to deprive the third party of its funds, it felt that it was bound by <span class="CITE"><i>In re
  McIntire</i>, 2002-0587 (La. 6/6/02), <a href="../SC/2002-06-06_2002-0587.htm">819 So.2d 305</a></span> and
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Browning</i>, <a href="1999-06-03_98-DB-070.htm">98-DB-070</a> (L.A.D.B., 6/3/99)</span>,
  and recommended that respondent be issued a public reprimand for failing to comply with Rule 1.15(b) and (c).</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The powers and duties of the Disciplinary Board are defined in Section 2 of Louisiana Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement.  Subsection (G)(2)(a) states that the Board is "to perform
  appellate review functions, consisting of review of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of
  hearing committees with respect to formal charges . . . and prepare and forward to the court its own findings, if
  any, and recommendations."  Inasmuch as the Board is serving in an appellate capacity, the standard of review applied
  to findings of fact is that of manifest error.<a name="_ftnref14" class="fn" href="#_ftn14" id="_ftnref14">[14]</a>
  The Board conducts a <i>de novo</i> review of the hearing committee's application of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct.<a name="_ftnref15" class="fn" href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In this instance, the factual findings of the hearing committee are supported by the evidence and
  are not manifestly erroneous.  They are adopted by the Board. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Relative to rule violations, the respondent was charged with violating Rules 1.3 (diligence) and
  1.15(b).  The committee declined to find a violation of Rule 1.3.  The Board agrees.  The committee found violations
  of sections (b) <b><i>and (c)</i></b> of Rule 1.15.  While the Board agrees with the committee's finding that
  respondent violated Rule <span class="Rules">1.15(b)</span>, it declines to find a violation of Rule 1.15(c).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Rule 1.15 is entitled "Safekeeping Property" and, at the time of the alleged misconduct,
  provided, in pertinent part:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>* * *</p>

    <p>(b) Upon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third person has an interest, a lawyer shall
    promptly notify the client or third person. Except as stated in this rule or otherwise permitted by law or by
    agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client or the third person any funds or other
    property that the client or third person is entitled to receive and, upon request by the client or third person,
    shall promptly render a full accounting regarding such property.</p>

    <p>(c) When in the course of representation a lawyer is in possession of property in which both the lawyer and
    another person claim interests, the property shall be kept separate by the lawyer until there is an accounting and
    severance of their interests.  If a dispute arises concerning their respective interests, the portion in dispute
    shall be kept separate by the lawyer until the dispute is resolved.</p>

    <p>* * *</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">In its report, the committee stated that reference was made during the hearing to Rule 1.15(c),
  and ODC questioned respondent about why he did not place the funds in a trust account. It found that respondent
  admitted the "mistake" of not placing the funds in his trust account.  Accordingly, it found a violation of Rule
  1.15(c).  The Board rejects this finding.  Respondent specifically testified that he did not believe that Rule
  1.15(c) was an issue because he was not charged with violating that rule.<a name="_ftnref16" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16">[16]</a> Under the circumstances, notwithstanding the "admission" made by the
  respondent, it would be improper for the Board to find a violation of Rule 1.15(c).<a name="_ftnref17" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn17" id="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Board finds that respondent violated Rule 1.15(b) because he wrote a letter to CIR stating,
  "I am guaranteeing that I will protect your fee from whatever settlement I obtain in this matter," but, upon receipt
  of settlement funds, he failed to notify CIR and failed to deliver any funds to CIR.  The Board has previously
  interpreted this type of guarantee to ethically obligate an attorney to pay a health care provider who renders
  treatment to a client.  In <i>In re McIntire, supra,</i><a name="_ftnref18" title="" href="#_ftn18"
  id="_ftnref18">[18]</a> an attorney was charged with violating Rule 1.15(b) for his failure to withhold settlement
  funds owed to a chiropractor and disbursing the funds to his client.  Mr. McIntire had written a letter to the
  chiropractor which stated:  "Please accept this letter of guarantee for any medical bills including x-rays." The
  Board rejected Mr. McIntire's argument that the health care provider had no liquidated interest, lien or statutory
  right to any portion of the settlement. The Court affirmed the Board's issuance of a public reprimand to Mr.
  McIntire.<a name="_ftnref19" class="fn" href="#_ftn19" id="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Following the <i>McIntire</i> decision, the Court amended Rule 1.15(b) to specifically define a
  third person's "interest."  The Court added the following language:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>For purposes of this rule, the third person's interest shall be one of which the lawyer has actual knowledge,
    and shall be limited to a statutory lien or privilege, a final judgment addressing disposition of those funds or
    property, or a written agreement by the client or the lawyer on behalf of the client guaranteeing payment out of
    those funds or property.<a name="_ftnref20" class="fn" href="#_ftn20" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent's letter of guarantee provides:  "I am guaranteeing that I will protect your fee from
  whatever settlement I obtain in this matter."  Considering the decision in <i>McIntire</i>, the additional guidance
  provided by the Court when it clarified the definition of "interest," and the facts of the instant matter, respondent
  was ethically obligated under Rule 1.15(b) to:  1) notify the chiropractor of the receipt of the settlement funds;
  and 2) promptly deliver the amounts that the chiropractor was "entitled to receive."  He failed to meet either
  requirement. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The undisputed evidence shows that Mr. Sutherland contacted CIR following the February 15, 2000
  status conference and attempted to negotiate the health care provider's fee with Ms. Harris, the owner of the
  chiropractic clinic.<a name="_ftnref21" class="fn" href="#_ftn21" id="_ftnref21">[21]</a> Respondent offered to
  settle for $2,122.00, the amount that the State Farm audit showed was the "usual and customary amount" for such
  services.  Ms. Harris refused his offer.<a name="_ftnref22" class="fn" href="#_ftn22" id="_ftnref22">[22]</a>
  Thereafter, in August of 2000, respondent settled the case and disbursed the funds to his client with the
  understanding that the client was to negotiate with the chiropractor.<a name="_ftnref23" class="fn" href="#_ftn23"
  id="_ftnref23">[23]</a> There is no evidence to show that Mr. Sutherland notified the chiropractor upon receipt of
  the settlement funds.  In fact, the evidence shows that Ms. Harris learned of the settlement from State
  Farm.<a name="_ftnref24" class="fn" href="#_ftn24" id="_ftnref24">[24]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The evidence also shows that respondent failed to promptly deliver the amounts that the
  chiropractor was entitled to receive.  He has argued that a dispute existed as to the amount that the chiropractor
  was entitled to receive and, therefore, his case is distinguishable from <i>McIntire</i>, in which there was no
  dispute as to the amount due.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">When a third person claims an interest in funds that a lawyer has in his possession, Rule 1.15(c)
  requires that the lawyer keep the funds separate and, if a dispute arises, the disputed portion of the funds must
  remain separate until the dispute is resolved.  As noted above, respondent was not charged with a violation of Rule
  1.15(c); nevertheless, the undisputed evidence shows that the chiropractor was entitled to receive $2,122.00.  That
  was the amount that the State Farm audit determined was "usual and customary," and it was the amount that the judge
  had indicated she would award and that respondent offered to CIR to settle its claim.  That amount should have been
  promptly delivered to the interested third party.  Under the circumstances, respondent's failure to do so was a
  violation of Rule 1.15(b).</p>

  <h2>SANCTION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court also relies on the ABA Standards to determine the baseline
  sanction.<a name="_ftnref25" class="fn" href="#_ftn25" id="_ftnref25">[25]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In violating Rule 1.15(b), the respondent negligently violated duties to his client and to the
  interested third party.  Respondent did not convert the funds to his own use.  He remitted them to his client with
  the understanding that the client would negotiate with the health care provider. The client was not harmed.  In fact,
  once respondent learned that CIR had not been paid, he was able to successfully negotiate with the health care
  provider which agreed to accept $2,122.00, the amount that respondent had offered approximately one year earlier.
  Respondent promptly paid CIR and made arrangements with his former client to be repaid.  The only harm was suffered
  by CIR, which was not paid for eleven months after the settlement funds were disbursed.<a name="_ftnref26" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn26" id="_ftnref26">[26]</a> Considering these factors, under the ABA Standards, the appropriate baseline
  sanction is admonition or public reprimand.<a name="_ftnref27" class="fn" href="#_ftn27" id="_ftnref27">[27]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee found several mitigating factors, including <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a
  prior disciplinary record</span>; <span class="ABAstandard">timely good faith effort to make restitution</span>;
  <span class="ABAstandard">full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board</span> and
  <span class="ABAstandard">cooperative attitude toward the proceedings</span>; and,
  <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>.  It found no aggravating factors.  The Board adopts these findings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the similar case of <i>In re McIntire</i>, <i>supra</i>, the Court affirmed the Board's
  issuance of a public reprimand.  Respondent's conduct is practically identical to that of Mr. McIntire.  Further, the
  damage sustained in the instant matter is similar to <i>McIntire</i> inasmuch as the amount owed to the health care
  provider in <i>McIntire</i> was $2,232.94 and the amount accepted by CIR in the instant matter was $2,122.00. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the heavy mitigating factors, particularly the fact of respondent's twenty-six year
  career without discipline, and his timely good faith effort to make restitution,<a name="_ftnref28" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn28" id="_ftnref28">[28]</a> it is with great reluctance that the Board recommends that respondent be
  issued a public reprimand.  Admonition may have been the most appropriate sanction;<a name="_ftnref29" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn29" id="_ftnref29">[29]</a> however, after formal charges are filed, admonition cannot be
  imposed.<a name="_ftnref30" class="fn" href="#_ftn30" id="_ftnref30">[30]</a> Accordingly, finding misconduct, the
  Board must issue a public reprimand. </p>

  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the record and evidence, the misconduct, the mitigating factors and the case law the
  Board adopts the report of the committee with the one modification noted above and issues a public reprimand to
  Preston G. Sutherland.  It further orders that respondent pay all costs and expenses associated with these
  disciplinary proceedings.</p>

  former version of Rule 1.15(b) or the present version, there is no question that respondent had knowledge of the

    <p class="bodycopy"><b>NUMBER 02-DB-093</b></p>

    <p class="bodycopy">I concur in the Board's recommendation.  However, I do so for reasons different from those
    assigned by the Board.  I do not agree that this case is or should be controlled by <span class="CITE"><u>In Re:
    McIntire</u>, 2002-0587 (La. 6/6/02), 819 So.2d 305</span>.  Respondent in this case wrote CIR (a health care
    provider) a letter dated May 14, 1997 stating that "I am guaranteeing that I will protect your fee from whatever
    settlement I obtain in this matter."  Presumably, this letter was written with the consent of the client.  At the
    time this letter was written, Rule 1.15(b), provided, in relevant part, that:</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">"Upon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third person has an interest, a
    lawyer shall promptly notify the client or third person.  Except as stated in this rule or otherwise permitted by
    law or by agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client or the third person any funds or
    other property that the client or third person is entitled to receive and, upon request by the client or third
    person, shall promptly render a full accounting regarding such property."</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">Respondent expressly agreed to pay CIR from "whatever settlement I obtain in this matter."  In
    my opinion, Respondent's failure to pay CIR is a clear violation of Rule 1.15(b).</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">In my view, <u>In Re McIntire</u> is distinguishable.  McIntire wrote the health care provider
    a letter stating "[p]lease accept this letter of guarantee for any medical bills including x-rays."  This was
    clearly a <b><i>personal</i></b> guarantee; it did not create any lien or interest on the proceeds of settlement. 
    Indeed, the guarantee was absolute; it was not conditioned upon any recovery.  As the dissent from the Board's
    recommendation in <u>McIntire</u> points out, McIntire's failure to honor his guarantee was a breach of contract,
    which is not necessarily a breach of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  The Supreme Court apparently did not
    recognize this distinction in its decision in <u>McIntire</u>.  However, the health care provider in
    <u>McIntire</u> may have been entitled to a lien on the proceeds of recovery under La. R.S. 9:4752, et seq.,
    although the opinions of the Board and the Supreme Court make no reference to that statute or to any other lien
    which may have existed as a matter of law.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy"><b><u>Dissent</u>:</b></p>

    <p class="bodycopy">I would dismiss the charges.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">Both the Hearing Committee and the Board majority would impose the sanction of a public
    reprimand "with great reluctance" but feeling bound by the <u>McIntire</u> case (2002-0587 (La. 6/6/02), So.2d 305)
    and a belief in uniformity.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">I see a material difference from <u>McIntire</u>, and I do not subscribe to the theory of
    uniformity.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">As to the latter, the facts of each individual case should govern the result. 
    <span class="CITE"><i>In re Whittington</i>, <a href="../SC/1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So.2d 520</a>
    (La.1984)</span> and <span class="CITE"><i>In re <u>LaHatte</u></i>, 2003-0437 (La. 6/27/03),
    <a href="../SC/2003-06-27_2003-0437.htm">851 S.2d 1024</a>, 1028</span>.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">In <u>McIntire</u>, the Supreme Court merely issued a <u>per</u> <u>curiam</u> saying "We find
    no error" in the Board ruling of a public reprimand.  The ruling itself discloses that, as here, the lawyer had
    issued a letter of guarantee of payment, did not withhold funds to pay the provider but gave the money to his
    client.  To this extent <u>McIntire</u> is similar.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">But in <u>McIntire</u> the provider made amicable demand upon Respondent, who "refused" to
    acknowledge responsibility for the balance, and in the disciplinary proceedings persisted in this refusal and
    claimed that the provider did not have any legal interest in the settlement funds (i.e., no liquidated interest,
    lien or statutory right).  Respondent continued in this position.  [Meanwhile, the provider sued Respondent on his
    guarantee.  That case was settled with Respondent paying the full balance due.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">This case is different.  The provider had rendered bills for $4799.  As in <u>McIntire</u>,
    Respondent claimed this amount against the tortfeasor's insurer on behalf of his client.  But here the court
    defendant protested the amount as beyond the usual and customary charges and in a pre-trial conference the Court
    agreed that on a trial it would not award more than $2122 for these services, i.e., the "usual and customary"
    charges, not the inflated charges claimed. Respondent then contacted the provider seeking his agreement to accept
    the $2122 (rather than $4799) and was refused.  The client then told Respondent to go ahead with the settlement
    (which included only $2122 for the chiropractor) and he, the client, would settle with the provider.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">The client did try to settle but his calls were not returned.  The chiropractor made no effort
    to notify Respondent that his bill had not been paid; Respondent believed that it had been paid by the client; and
    the chiropractor then filed a complaint with ODC, claiming the inflated amount of $4799. ODC's notice to Respondent
    of the complaint was Respondent's first notice that his client had not paid the provider's bill.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">At this point Respondent immediately contacted the provider and paid him an agreed settlement
    amount of $2122 in satisfaction of his "guarantee."  The client testified that he will reimburse Respondent, but I
    note that Respondent did not condition his [payment to the chiropractor of the sum to which he was entitled ($2122)
    upon any reimbursement.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">ODC charged Respondent with violation of Rule 1.15(b).  Rule 1.15(c) was not charged.  It is
    clear to me that the chiropractor was not "entitled to receive" $4799, which he was demanding, and that
    Respondent's failure to pay him what he was demanding was no breach of Rule 1.15(b).  Furthermore, the
    chiropractor's refusal to accept $2122 relieved Respondent of any duty to pay him that amount "on account."</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">Because Respondent had freely admitted that rather than paying the client and letting his
    client negotiate the bills he should have retained the money in his trust account, the Hearing Committee found a
    violation of Rule 1.15(c) [as well  as Rule 1.15(b).</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">I agree with Respondent that the prudent course would have been to escrow the full $4799 until
    the matter was adjusted.  That was an error on his part and a possible violation of 1.15(c).  It also exposed
    Respondent to personal liability on his guarantee.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">It is doubtful in my mind that the chiropractor had a legal interest in the funds.  See my
    dissent in <u>McIntire</u> and the revised wording of Rule 1.15(c).</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">But as soon as Respondent learned that the provider had not been paid by his client he stepped
    up and honored his guarantee.  That distinguishes this case from <u>McIntire</u>.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">In my opinion when that happened this proceeding should have not been brought.  It is clear to
    me that if the chiropractor had notified Respondent after the settlement that he had not been paid Respondent would
    have stepped up then as he did when ODC informed him.  I have no sympathy whatsoever for the provider who (a)
    attempted to overcharge the case and (b) then utilized ODC as a collection agency without so much as a previous
    telephone call or letter requesting payment to Respondent.  Any delay in the provider's receipt of what he was due
    is on his head alone.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">The only injured party here is Respondent.  While he did make a mistake and failed to follow
    Rule 1.15(c) all of the circumstances of the case convince me that this violation is not representative of bad
    ethics.  Lawyers should not be sanctioned for a "mistake" which causes no injury to anyone.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">For the reasons stated above, I disagree with the finding that the chiropractor suffered any
    harm caused by Respondent.  I disagree with the notion that Respondent should have paid the chiropractor the $2122
    leaving his client open to further claim.  That conduct would have been harmful to his client.  Rule 1.15(b) calls
    for notification, delivery and accounting upon request.  It seems to me that notification occurred (albeit before
    receipt of funds) when Respondent advised the provider of the Court's analysis and sought agreement on that sum; as
    soon as the chiropractor agreed to take $2122 to which he was entitled Respondent paid him; and the chiropractor
    never requested an accounting.</p>

    <p class="bodycopy">I would dismiss the charges and leave Respondent with a clear record.</p>
