  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: BRENDA F. FORD-JONES</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">   This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a petition for consent discipline by
  Brenda F. Ford-Jones prior to the filing of formal charges.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">   On January 22, 1999, Respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel filed a joint petition
  for consent discipline, prior to the filing of formal charges.  The petition states that Respondent failed to notify
  and deliver funds claimed by a medical provider, notwithstanding a letter of guarantee.  It is agreed that
  Respondent's behavior violates Rule <span class="allegedrules">1.15(b)</span>.  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  also filed a concurrence on January 22, 1999.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">   A panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter on February 25, 1999.  Respondent did
  not appear and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel was represented by Deputy Counsel Julie B. White</p>

  <h2>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">   Respondent failed to deliver all the funds claimed by a medical provider, despite executing a
  letter of guarantee in favor of the provider.  The doctor's bill totaled $6,023.75 and Respondent paid only $1000;
  the remainder of the settlement funds was disbursed to the client.  This complaint involves a violation of the Rules
  of Professional Conduct 1.15.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">   <span>Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX '10(C)</span> states that in imposing a sanction after
  a finding of lawyer misconduct, the court or board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">   (1)   whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to  the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">   (2)   whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">   (3)   the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">   (4)   the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">   The  Board finds that Respondent is guilty of the misconduct set forth in petition for consent
  discipline by clear and convincing evidence.  The Board finds that Respondent has violated duties owed to her client,
  and has engaged in negligent misconduct. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">   The Board finds the following <i>A.B.A. Standards</i> '9.22 aggravating circumstance to be
  present: <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>.  The <i>A.B.A. Standards</i>
  '9.32 mitigating factors are a <span class="ABAstandard">cooperative attitude toward these proceedings</span>;
  <span class="ABAstandard">an absence of dishonest and selfish motive</span>; <span class="ABAstandard">good faith
  efforts at restitution</span> and <span class="ABAstandard">no prior discipline</span>. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">   In consent disciplines, the Board may reject proposed discipline as too lenient, but when
  Respondent and disciplinary counsel have agreed that a violation has occurred, it may not reject consent discipline
  claiming that there was no violation.  <i>See</i> <span class="CITE">In re: Lieberman, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96);
  <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So.2d 272</a></span>.  The Disciplinary Board therefore orders that
  Respondent, Brenda F. Ford-Jones, be issued a public reprimand and further orders that she be assessed with all costs
  and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of
  this Ruling until paid.</p>
