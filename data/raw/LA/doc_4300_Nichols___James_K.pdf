  <p class='headingstyle'>ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class='signature'>PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class='Bodycopy'>This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from three counts of formal charges instituted by
  the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, James K. Nichols, an attorney licensed to practice law
  in the State of Louisiana.  The charges allege violations of Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (lack of due
  diligence), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to comply with reasonable requests for information),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.15(a)</span> (commingling of client funds with attorney's funds),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.15(b)</span> (failure to protect the interests of a third party in settlement proceeds),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(b)</span> (engaging in criminal acts adversely reflecting on a lawyer's honesty), and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or
  misrepresentation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <h3>Count I. Thompson Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent acted as attorney for Horace Alford and prepared a trust instrument for him, whereby
  certain sums of money would be transferred to various persons upon Mr. Alford's death.  Mr. Alford died on March 18,
  1992, and Beauregard Federal Savings Bank, the bank holding the trust funds, disbursed the funds to the various
  beneficiaries.  On April 15, 1992, the bank sent three checks to respondent for delivery to the appropriate parties,
  including a check in the amount of $65,000 payable to Mrs. R.V. Thompson.  Respondent endorsed and deposited this
  check into his client trust account without the knowledge or permission of Mrs. Thompson.  Despite Mrs. Thompson's
  requests to respondent for the funds, he did not deliver them to her until May 20, 1992.  Respondent's financial
  records indicated that his client trust account fell below the escrowed amount the period he held the
  funds.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As a result of this conduct, the attorney general's office conducted an Investigation
  <a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a>  and later charged respondent in the Thirty-Sixth Judicial
  District Court for the Parish of Beauregard with one count of felony unauthorized use of a movable valued in excess
  of $1,000, in violation of La.R.S. 14:68.  Respondent subsequently pled guilty to this charge.  He received a
  one-year suspended sentence, along with a $3,000 fine. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Additionally, he was placed on two years probation, and ordered to perform 500 hours of community
  service.  Respondent also resigned his judgeship.</p>

  <h3>Count II:  Simmons/Barksdale Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent represented the Barksdale Credit Union in a collection matter involving Sandra Poe
  Simmons.  On March 15, 1989, Ms. Simmons sent a check to respondent in the amount of $5,500, representing partial
  payment of the judgment.  She forwarded the remaining balance of $814 to him on March 28, 1989.  Respondent deposited
  both checks into his escrow account and deducted his attorney's fees.  Although respondent canceled the judicial
  mortgage on Ms. Simmons' property, he failed to forward the funds to the credit union.<a name="fnref3" class="fn"
  href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></p>

  <h3>Count III. Other Escrow Deficiencies</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's financial records indicate that his client trust account became overdrawn on four
  occasions from July 29, 1991 to May 26, 1995.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On November 17, 1994, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent, involving the
  Thompson matter only.  Respondent filed an answer. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, after respondent entered his guilty plea in connection with the Thompson criminal
  proceedings, this court him on interim suspension, effective June 15, 1996, pursuant to Rule XIX, Section 19. 
  <span class="CITE">In re Nichols, 96-1080 (La.5/30/96), 673 So.2d 598</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Prior to the formal hearing, respondent filed a petition for consent discipline, seeking a
  suspension for a period of one year and one day, totally deferred, subject to a two year probation with certain
  conditions.  The ODC concurred in the petition, and the hearing committee recommended that it be approved.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The matter was then submitted to the disciplinary board.  Prior to rendering its recommendation,
  the board learned of the Simmons/Barksdale matter and the escrow account deficiencies.  Accordingly, the board stayed
  its decision until a full review of these matters could be conducted.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent and the ODC then jointly submitted an amended consent discipline proposal which
  encompassed all the allegations of misconduct against respondent.  The petition sought the imposition of a three year
  suspension from the practice of law, with two years deferred, followed by a two year period of supervised probation
  subject to conditions.  The disciplinary board recommended that this court adopt the proposed consent discipline.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On October 10, 1997, this court rejected the proposed consent discipline and directed the ODC to
  institute formal charges in the Simmons/Barksdale matter and the escrow account deficiencies, and to consolidate them
  with the formal charges filed in the Thompson matter.  <span class="CITE"><b><i>In re Nichols</i></b>, 97-2246
  (La.10/10/97), 703 So.2d 593, reh'g denied, (La.11/21/98), 703 So.2d 1295</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Pursuant to this order, the ODC supplemented and amended the formal charges to include Count II
  and Count III, relating to the Simmons/Barksdale matter and escrow deficiencies, respectively.  A formal hearing
  before the committee was conducted on all three charges.  Respondent appeared at the hearing and was represented by
  counsel.  By stipulation, the parties introduced the entire record and findings of the disciplinary board in its
  earlier recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/1998-04-15_94-DB-037.htm">Hearing Committee Findings and
  Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As to the Thompson matter, the committee found respondent violated the rules as charged. 
  However, as to Counts II and III, the committee determined "respondent's conduct constituted, at worst, simple
  negligence" and did not rise to the level of a violation of the Rules of Conduct.  The committee adopted by reference
  the aggravating factors <a name="fnref4" class="fn" href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a> and mitigating
  factors<a name="fnref5" class="fn" href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a> which were recognized by the disciplinary board in
  its earlier recommendation. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these considerations, the committee recommended respondent be suspended from the
  practice of law for a period of two years, with six months of the suspension deferred, subject to a two year period
  of probation with conditions.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/1998-11-25_94-DB-037.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board concurred in the findings of the hearing committee that respondent
  converted funds in the Thompson matter, as set forth in Count I. However, it deviated from the committee's findings
  with respect to Counts II and III, concluding that respondent's negligence in connection with these matters
  constituted professional violations.<a name="fnref6" class="fn" href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a>  Accordingly, the board
  found all three counts of misconduct were proved by clear and convincing evidence.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board adopted the aggravating and mitigating factors cited in its earlier recommendation. 
  However, the board elaborated on three of the mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As to the mitigating factor of mental disability, the board noted the respondent suffered from
  major depression from 1992 to 1995.  In 1992, he sought treatment and was doing well until June, 1994, when he
  stopped taking his medication and suffered a relapse.  In February, 1995, he began seeking additional treatment.  In
  an independent evaluation conducted by Dr. James a board certified psychiatrist, respondent was diagnosed with "major
  depression, recurrent, severe, without psychotic symptoms, in full remission."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, respondent began regular treatment with Dr. Anderson, as well as a therapist.  In
  support of the mitigating factor of <span class="ABAstandard">delay in disciplinary proceedings</span>, the
  disciplinary board pointed out all the actions forming the basis for the charges had occurred between six and
  one-half years to nine years ago.  The board also recognized respondent has been on interim suspension for two and
  one-half years without a final decision on his case.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Finally, in support of the mitigating factor of <span class="ABAstandard">imposition of other
  penalties</span>, the board noted the respondent was prosecuted in the criminal justice system for his conduct in the
  Thompson matter.  The board observed that "in many areas of the state, lawyers are not prosecuted for theft of client
  funds when restitution has been made promptly, or when civil remedies are available."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">While the board conceded respondent's misconduct warranted a baseline sanction of a three year
  suspension under the commingling and conversion guidelines set forth in <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Hinrichs</i>, <a href="1986-03-31_1984-1459.htm">486 So.2d 116</a> (La.1986)</span>, it found the
  significant mitigating factors justified a deviation from this sanction.  Accordingly, the board recommended
  respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of three years, with one year deferred, retroactive to
  the date of his interim suspension. <a name="fnref7" class="fn" href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the recommendation of the
  disciplinary board.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The record supports the conclusion that all three counts of misconduct against respondent have
  been proven by clear and convincing evidence.  Of these, the conversion of trust funds in the Thompson matter is
  clearly the most serious misconduct.  Respondent forged an endorsement on a $65,000 check made out to</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mrs. Thompson and deposited it in his trust account without her knowledge.  It was undisputed
  that during the period respondent held the funds, the balance in his trust account fell below $65,000.  While
  respondent ultimately made full restitution Mrs. Thompson, she was deprived of her funds for over twenty days.  Under
  the guidelines set forth in <i>Hinrichs</i>, the baseline sanction for respondent's conduct ranges from disbarment to
  a three year suspension.<a name="fnref8" class="fn" href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">However, we agree with the disciplinary board that there are several mitigating factors present,
  the most significant of which are respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">mental problems</span> at the time of the
  misconduct, and the fact that he was criminally prosecuted for his actions.  Under these circumstances, the sanction
  recommended by the disciplinary board is appropriate.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is the decision of this court that the recommendation of the disciplinary board be
  adopted.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, it is ordered that respondent, James K. Nichols, be suspended from the practice of
  law for a period of three years, with one year of said suspension deferred.  It is further ordered that the
  commencement of the suspension be made retroactive to the date of respondent's interim suspension, June 15, 1996. 
  All costs in this matter are assessed against respondent, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date
  of the finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class='footnotetext'><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> Bank records of the client trust
  account indicated that between April 30,1992 and May 21, 1992, the respondent converted between $28,777.48 and
  $31,228.26.</p>

  <p class='footnotetext'><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">2</a> The investigation was commenced by the
  attorney general's office, since at the time of the criminal charges, respondent was a judge of the DeRidder City
  Court.  Respondent subsequently resigned from the bench.</p>

  <p class='footnotetext'><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3" id="fn3">3</a>  The credit union did not receive its
  portion of the funds until February 20, 1996, seven years after Ms. Simmons had paid the funds to respondent.</p>

  <p class='footnotetext'><a name="fn4" class="fn" href="#fnref4" id="fn4">4</a>  These aggravating factors were: 
  <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offense</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice
  of law</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerable victim</span> and <span class="ABAstandard">illegal
  conduct</span>.</p>

  <p class='footnotetext'><a name="fn5" class="fn" href="#fnref5" id="fn5">5</a>  These mitigating factors were:  prior
  disciplinary record, timely good faith effort to make restitution, full and free disclosure to the board and
  cooperation in the disciplinary proceedings, delay in disciplinary proceedings, personal or emotional problems,
  mental disability or impairment, imposition of other penalties and sanctions, public and private statements of
  remorse, no profit to respondent, otherwise good character and service to his church and community, and payment of
  all costs.  The disciplinary board also listed serious adverse publicity as a mitigating factor, but the hearing
  committee declined to adopt this factor.</p>

  <p class='footnotetext'><a name="fn6" class="fn" href="#fnref6" id="fn6">6</a>  Since the hearing committee did not
  render factual findings as to Counts II and III, and since the matter was submitted primarily on documentary
  evidence, the board adopted its findings from its earlier recommendation.  With regard to the Simmons/Barksdale
  matter, the board noted the respondent alleged he told his bookkeeper to send the payoff amount to the credit union
  when he had the judgment canceled.  When respondent learned the proceeds were never forwarded, he instructed his
  staff to mail the payoff.. The board recognized that no criminal charges were filed in this matter.  As to the escrow
  deficiencies, respondent alleged the four instances in which the trust account was overdrawn involved situations in
  which the respondent closed loans and issued the loan proceed checks from his trust account prior to depositing the
  funds from the mortgagee.  Respondent contended the trust account in these instances were overdrawn for a few hours
  or until the next business day, and were primarily bookkeeping oversights, although one involved a check on which the
  mortgage company stopped payment for seven days when a loan packet did not timely arrive in accordance with terms of
  the mortgage agreement.</p>

  <p class='footnotetext'><a name="fn7" class="fn" href="#fnref7" id="fn7">7</a> The disciplinary board specifically
  noted that it did not recommend that a probationary period or conditions accompany the deferred period of suspension,
  but stated that imposition of probation may be appropriate at the time respondent applies for reinstatement.</p>

  <p class='footnotetext'><a name="fn8" class="fn" href="#fnref8" id="fn8">8</a>  <b><i>In Hinrichs</i></b>, we
  explained:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class='footnotetext'>In a typical case of disbarment [for commingling and conversion], one or more of the
    following elements are usually present:  the lawyer acts in bad faith and intends a result inconsistent with his
    client's interest;  the lawyer commits forgery or other fraudulent acts in connection with the violation;  the
    magnitude or the duration of the deprivation is extensive;  the magnitude of the damage or risk of damage, expense
    and inconvenience caused the client is great;  the lawyer either fails to make full restitution or does so tardily
    after extended pressure of disciplinary or legal proceedings.</p>

    <p class='footnotetext'>A three year suspension from practice typically results in cases involving similar but less
    aggravated factors.  In such cases the lawyer is guilty of at least a high degree of negligence in causing his
    client's funds to be withdrawn or retained in violation of the disciplinary rule.  He usually does not commit other
    fraudulent acts in connection therewith.  The attorney usually benefits from the infraction but, in contrast with
    disbarment cases, the client may not be greatly harmed or exposed to great risk of harm.  The attorney fully
    reimburses or pays his client the funds due without the necessity of extensive disciplinary or legal
    proceedings.</p>
