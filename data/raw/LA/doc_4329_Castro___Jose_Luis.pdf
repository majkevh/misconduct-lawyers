This court disbarred respondent in 1997, and he was fully aware of his ethical obligations. The ODC indicated respondent chose to violate the </font><font size="3">, then aggravated his behavior by engaging in the unauthorized practice of law while soliciting numerous cases. Respondent's failure to respond to the charges delayed the disciplinary process, diverted its limited resources, and impaired the system's orderly functioning.</font><p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ODC recognized the following aggravating factors: prior misconduct;</font><font size="3"><sup>2 </sup></font><font size="3">dishonest or selfish motive; a pattern of misconduct; multiple offenses; bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary process by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency; refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct; and victim vulnerability.

<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On October 2, 1998, the hearing committee filed its report with the ODC Concluding the respondent is guilty of the unlawful payment of money to others for the purpose of obtaining clients, engaging in the unauthorized practice of law, improperly soliciting clients, failing to properly remit clients' settlement funds and provide an accounting, holding himself out to be a lawyer despite suspension and disbarment, failing to inform his clients that he was ineligible to practice law, engaging in an improper conflict of interest against a former client by filing suit against the client without authorization, aiding and abiding others in the unauthorized practice of law, failing tosupervise his office personnel and office procedure, failing to remit third party funds properly,&nbsp; improperly settling clients' cases without authorization, and failing to respond and cooperate with the ODC.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The committee found no mitigating factors but indicated the following aggravating Factors were present: prior misconduct, dishonesty with selfish motive, pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, obstruction of disciplinary investigation, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, and vulnerability of the victim. The committee indicated the most serious sanction, disbarment, was appropriate.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On March 12, 1999, the disciplinary board issued its recommendation to the court, concurring in the findings of the hearing committee. The board noted that the ODC submitted 126 exhibits to support the misconduct set forth in all eighteen counts of formal charges, and that the charges were proved by clear and convincing evidence. The Board found respondent has violated duties owed to the legal system, the <br>
profession and the public, and he has engaged in knowing and intentional misconduct.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The board did not find any mitigating factors, but it concurred with the aggravating factors set forth by the ODC. The board also noted, that in his first disbarment, the Supreme Court found that respondent's lack of experience was actually an aggravating factor. The board agreed that this remains an aggravating factor, and that no mitigating factors are present. Accordingly, the Board recommended respondent's disbarment be extended by another five years, to run fromthe date offinality of the court's judgment in this matter.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the recommendation of the disciplinary board.<br>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The record supports the findings of fact made by the hearing committee anddisciplinary board that respondent coned the professional misconduct as charged. Among numerous other disciplinary violations,&nbsp; respondent knowingly and intentionally used runners to solicit business, held himself out to be a lawyer when he was suspended or disbarred, and engaged the unauthorized practice of law. Respondent further refused to participate in the disciplinary proceedings. This conduct, combined with that involved in his prior disciplinary offense, indicates the respondent lacks the moral fitness to practice law and is a threat to his clients, the profession and the public.<br>
