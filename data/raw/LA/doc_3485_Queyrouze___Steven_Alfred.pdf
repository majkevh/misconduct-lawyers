  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: STEVEN QUEYROUZE</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">DISCIPLINARY BOARD RULING</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On July 30, 1991, John Deveney filed a complaint with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel alleging
  that Steven Queyrouze had represented Mr. Deveney in an accident case without a signed contingency fee contract, had
  failed to communicate the basis of the fee, had failed to give an accounting for the fee, and was attempting to
  charge an excessive and unreasonable fee in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The charges were dismissed (citing them as a matter of fee dispute) by Disciplinary Counsel on
  September 17, 1993.  The dismissal was appealed by complainant; however, after consideration by the chair, Ike
  Spears, of Hearing Committee #9, the dismissal was affirmed on March 21, 1994.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On April 25, 1994, complainant, Deveney, filed a Section 30 <b>A</b> Appeal Request to reverse
  the dismissal.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, on June 9, 1994, a panel of the Board remanded the case to the Disciplinary Counsel
  for formal charges.  As a result, the Disciplinary Counsel on September 20, 1995 filed formal charges against
  Respondent on two counts.  Count I charged that Respondent failed to have a signed written contingency contract,
  failed to communicate the basis of the fee, failed to give an accounting for the fee, and charged an excessive and
  unreasonable fee in violation of Rules <span class="Rules">1.5(a)</span>, (b) and (c) and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span>. Count II charged that Respondent failed to make prompt and proper remittance of
  the funds in violation of Rules <span class="Rules">1.15(b)</span> and (c) and <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On February 15, 1995, a Motion for Consent Discipline was filed by Respondent and Disciplinary
  Counsel.  The matter was considered by <span class="cite"><a href="../HC/1996-04-17_95-DB-040.htm">Hearing Committee
  #14</a></span> on April 4, 1996.  On April 12, 1996, the Hearing Committee recommended that the Motion for Consent
  Discipline be granted adopting as its opinion the aggravating and mitigating circumstances as set forth in paragraph
  IV and V of the Disciplinary Counsel's Concurrence in the Consent Discipline.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Disciplinary Board finds no manifest error in the Hearing Committee's decision either as to
  the facts or as to the approved discipline and, therefore, the Hearing Committee's report is approved, adopted and
  incorporated herein.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, the Disciplinary Board publicly reprimands Respondent Steven Queyrouze, pursuant to
  Rule XIX, Section 10 A (4) for his oversight in failing to have his former client execute a contingent fee contract,
  and assess all costs of these proceedings against Respondent.</p>
