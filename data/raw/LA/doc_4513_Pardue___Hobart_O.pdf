<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 02-B-0169</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: HOBART O. PARDUE, JR.</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>

<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp; </p>

<p class="bodycopy">This disciplinary
matter arises from a petition for consent discipline filed jointly by
respondent, Hobart O. Pardue, Jr., and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”)
following the institution of formal charges. For respondent’s misconduct, the
parties proposed a six-month period of suspension to run consecutively to the
suspension imposed in a prior disciplinary matter. The disciplinary board
recommended the joint petition for consent discipline be accepted.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">Respondent was
retained as the attorney for the Succession of Lloyd Schenk. While serving in
that capacity, respondent advised the heirs of the succession to oppose his
client, the administratrix, and he signed pleadings filed into the record in
opposition to his clients.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">Following its
investigation into the complaint filed against respondent by the administratrix
of the Schenk succession, the ODC filed one count of formal charges alleging
that respondent’s conduct in that matter constituted a violation of Rule
<span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.7 --#">1.7</a></span> (conflict of interest) of the Rules of
Professional Conduct. </p>
<p class="bodycopy">Prior to a formal
hearing in the matter, respondent and the ODC filed a joint petition for consent
discipline. In the petition, respondent admitted that he violated Rule 1.7 by
engaging in a conflict of interest in connection with his representation of the
Schenk succession. The parties set forth several mitigating factors, including
no harm to the client, respondent’s cooperative attitude toward the proceedings,
delay in bringing the complaint, and remorse. In aggravation, the parties
acknowledged respondent’s prior disciplinary record and substantial experience
in the practice of law (admitted 1966). For his misconduct, respondent and the
ODC proposed that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six
months, to run consecutively to the suspension imposed in <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Pardue</i>,
98-3017 (La. 3/26/99), <a href="#!-- #ID:731%20So.2d%20224 --#">731 So. 2d 224</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bodycopy">In a joint
stipulation of facts submitted with the petition for consent discipline, the
parties set forth the underlying facts of the Schenk matter. In October 1983,
Lloyd Schenk, whom respondent had represented for approximately fifteen years,
offered certain undeveloped property for sale. Respondent purchased the property
from Mr. Schenk and executed an act of credit sale in favor of his client.
Respondent paid $45,000 in cash and an additional sum of $33,000 on the note
before Mr. Schenk died in August 1984. Four days after Mr. Schenk’s death, his
widow, Judy Schenk, requested that respondent handle the succession proceedings.
At the time, Mrs. Schenk indicated that she could not afford to pay attorney’s
fees, so she and respondent agreed that respondent would offset his fees against
any amounts he still owed on the note. The parties acknowledge that although
respondent discussed the note with Mrs. Schenk in 1984 in connection with his
representation of the estate, he “did not adhere precisely to the requirements
of Rule 1.7, with respect to the level of consultation and waiver required.”</p>
<p class="bodycopy">In October 1998,
Mrs. Schenk retained separate counsel in connection with a dispute concerning
the administrative fees which she sought to recover from the succession. The
following year, in the process of winding up the succession, a disagreement
arose concerning respondent’s note for the purchase of the property, and whether
that note belonged to Mrs. Schenk personally or to the succession. In May 1999,
Mrs. Schenk’s attorney suggested to respondent that the best way to resolve the
question of the ownership of the note was for respondent to file a rule to show
cause on behalf of the estate. Respondent drafted the rule and filed it into the
record on behalf of Joseph Schenk, the sole legatee of Lloyd Schenk. Following a
hearing on the rule to show cause, the presiding judge ruled that the note
belonged to the estate. </p>
<p class="bodycopy">At the conclusion
of the matter, respondent charged an attorney’s fee of $31,250 for handling the
succession, which was offset against the balance owed on the purchase of the
property from Lloyd Schenk. Respondent paid an additional $40,000 to the heirs,
representing the balance of the purchase price, which amount was negotiated
between respondent and independent counsel for the heirs.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-041.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary
board found that respondent knowingly engaged in a conflict of interest by
filing a rule to show cause on behalf of the legatee, Joseph Schenk, against
Mrs. Schenk, who was the administratrix of the estate and who was also claiming
a personal interest in the note. The record is unclear whether respondent
disclosed this conflict to Mrs. Schenk or to her attorney. However, the parties
stipulated that no actual injury befell the administratrix, and the board noted
that the trial judge ultimately ruled the note belonged to the estate.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Relying on the
ABA’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions and jurisprudence from this court
involving violations of Rule 1.7, the board determined that respondent engaged
in conduct that prevented him from exercising his independent professional
judgment on behalf of his client. For this misconduct, the board suggested that
a six-month suspension is an appropriate sanction. Accordingly, the board
recommended the proposed consent discipline be accepted. </p>
<p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent
nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board’s recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">Although this
matter arises from a petition for consent discipline, <span class="AllRules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s20B --#">20</a>(B)</span> provides that the extent of discipline to
be imposed is subject to review. In determining an appropriate sanction, we are
mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of
conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter
future misconduct. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The
discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness
of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating
circumstances. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">The record
reflects that respondent engaged in a prohibited conflict of interest in
connection with his representation of a succession. Respondent’s conduct is a
clear violation of the professional rules and warrants discipline. This finding
is tempered to some degree by the fact that respondent’s client suffered no harm
and by the length of time which elapsed before the complaint was filed.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Based on these
factors, we find the proposed consent discipline is appropriate under the
circumstances. Accordingly, we will accept the petition for consent discipline.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the
findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the
record filed herein, it is ordered that Hobart O. Pardue, Jr. be suspended from
the practice of law for a period of six months, to run consecutively to the
suspension imposed in <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Pardue</i>, 98-3017 (La. 3/26/99),
<a href="#!-- #ID:731%20So.2d%20224 --#">731 So. 2d 224</a></span>. All costs and
expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with
Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from
the date of finality of this court’s judgment until paid.<br>

<p class="footnotetext">1 In <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Pardue</i>, 98-3017 (La. 3/26/99),

May 28, 1999</span>, respondent was suspended for two years following his conviction of
willfully making and subscribing a false tax return, a felony under federal law.
In addition, in an unrelated matter, respondent attempted to negotiate a
settlement of a lawsuit against the state without the knowledge or consent of
the state’s counsel. Respondent has not filed an application for reinstatement
from the 1999 suspension, which ended on May 28, 2001, and thus he remains
suspended from the practice of law. In <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La.
3/11/94), <a href="#!-- #ID:633%20So.2d%20150 --#">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>, respondent
was reprimanded for failing to disclose for a period of several months that he
had not timely filed suit on behalf of a client. In 1994, the disciplinary board
admonished respondent for representing a client with a conflict, failing to
supervise an associate attorney, and failing to cooperate with the ODC in its
investigation (<span class="CITE">94-ADB-011</span>). Finally, respondent received private reprimands in
1987 and 1988 for neglecting legal matters.</p>
<p class="footnotetext">2 The succession proceedings were complicated by an alleged illegitimate son
of the decedent who sought to be recognized as an heir. In addition, the
immovable property owned by the estate was not sold until 1996 because of a
recession in the real estate market.</p>
<p class="footnotetext">3 Standard 4.32 provides that suspension is generally appropriate when a
lawyer knows of a conflict of interest and does not fully disclose to a client
the possible effect of that conflict, and causes injury or potential injury to a
client.<br>
