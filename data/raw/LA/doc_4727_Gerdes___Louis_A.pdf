  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: LOUIS A. GERDES, JR.</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary proceeding involves ten counts of misconduct filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Louis A. Gerdes, Jr., an attorney licensed to practice law in
  Louisiana.<a name="_ftnref1" class="fn" href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">1</a></p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <h3>Count I - Jones Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In December 1992, Latonya Jones retained respondent to represent her two minor children in a case
  against her landlord for lead poisoning exposure.  Since Ms. Jones was only seventeen years old, respondent named
  Cynthia Knight, Ms. Jones' sister, as the plaintiff in the suit instituted on behalf of the minors.  Subsequently,
  the defendants filed a Dilatory Exception of Lack of Procedural Capacity on the basis that Ms. Knight had not been
  properly qualified to act as tutrix.  The trial court granted the defendants' motion, and allowed respondent an
  additional thirty days to have Ms. Knight properly qualified.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent took no measures to have Ms. Knight qualified within this time period.  As a result,
  defendants filed a motion to dismiss the suit, which the trial court granted.  Respondent filed a motion for new
  trial from the dismissal, but failed to have this motion set for hearing.  Additionally, respondent failed to advise
  his clients of the dismissal of their suit.</p>

  <h3>Count II - Ricard Matter </h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Sandra Ricard retained respondent to represent her in a personal injury action  arising out of a
  July 1996 slip and fall accident at the Louisiana Superdome.  Respondent filed  suit on Ms. Ricard's behalf in July
  1997, but failed to provide any service information in the petition. Almost two years later, in March 1999, Ms.
  Ricard complained to respondent that no action had been taken in her case.  Thereafter, respondent requested service
  of the suit.  However, service was not effectuated until July 28, 1999, two years after the suit had been filed and
  months after Ms. Ricard had discharged respondent and filed a complaint with the ODC.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In his testimony at the formal hearing, respondent testified he did not think Ms. Ricard "had
  much of a case" due to problems with proof of liability.  He indicated his decision to file the suit was a "last
  minute decision" and was done  "just to protect her rights."</p>

  <h3>Count III - Brown Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Shearle and Shorrne Brown<a name="_ftnref2" class="fn" href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">2</a> retained
  respondent to represent them in a personal injury action for injuries allegedly sustained on December 16, 1995 while
  traveling on a bus operated by the Regional Transit Authority of New Orleans.  On December 16, 1996, respondent filed
  suit on his clients' behalf, but failed to provide any service instructions until several months later.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, on the grounds that service had not been made
  in the time provided by law, and an exception of vagueness/ambiguity. Respondent took no action on behalf of his
  clients in response to the motion and exception.  Further, respondent neglected to communicate with his clients
  regarding the status of the case.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In May 1999, the Browns filed a complaint with the ODC alleging that respondent failed to
  communicate with them.  Respondent filed a response alleging he had been communicating with his clients' mother since
  his clients were young adults who resided with their mother.  He also explained that he accepted 300 or 400 cases per
  year and sometimes gets "stuck" with cases that he shouldn't have taken.</p>

  <h3>Count IV - Hampton Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Larry Hampton retained respondent to represent him in a personal injury action arising out of a
  bus accident in Jefferson Parish.  On April 25, 1996, respondent filed suit on behalf of his client.  Although
  respondent provided service instructions in the petition, he failed to pay the filing fee for service.  Respondent
  took no further action in the case and failed to communicate with Mr. Hampton, who had moved to California.  Mr.
  Hampton retained Rose Molloy, a California attorney, to assist him in obtaining information about the status of his
  case.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In May 1999, Mr. Hampton and Ms. Molloy each filed a complaint with the ODC.  Two  months later
  (and three years after the suit had been filed), respondent paid the filing fee to effectuate service of process.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">At the formal hearing, respondent asserted the delay in effectuating service was due to the
  denial of Mr. Hampton's motion to proceed in formal pauperis and the failure of his employee to determine if service
  had been made.  However, he admitted he did not communicate with Mr. Hampton.</p>

  <h3>Count V - Francis Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 1994, Florence Francis retained respondent to represent her in two personal injury matters. 
  One of the matters was dismissed on grounds of abandonment in May 1999.  Respondent filed a motion for new trial,
  which was granted by the trial court.  As such, the suit was reinstated.  Subsequently, the parties satisfactorily
  settled the matter.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The second suit was dismissed on the grounds of prescription.  According to respondent, his
  failure to file the suit timely was due improper information provided by his client about her personal injury
  claim.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In June 1999, Ms. Francis filed a complaint with the ODC alleging  respondent's failure to
  communicate with her regarding the dismissal of her suits.<a name="_ftnref3" class="fn" href="#_ftn3"
  id="_ftnref3">3</a></p>

  <h3>Count VI - Williams Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 1998, respondent employed  Charles Williams, a Louisiana attorney who had been suspended from
  the practice of law, as a paralegal.<a name="_ftnref4" class="fn" href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">4</a> In June 1998,
  respondent sent Mr. Williams to attend the deposition of one of respondent's clients.  According to the ODC, Mr.
  Williams did not advise the parties present at the deposition that he was suspended from practice, and provided
  assistance as counsel in response to two questions directed by opposing counsel to respondent's client.</p>

  <h3>Count VII - Navarre Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Ricardo Navarre retained respondent in 1987 to represent him in connection with class action
  litigation arising out of a railroad tank car fire.  After the criteria of the class was determined, counsel for all
  plaintiffs (including respondent) were instructed to advise their clients to register to become members of the
  class.  Respondent sent one letter to Mr. Navarre on June 8, 1990, but the letter did not advise Mr. Navarre of the
  court-ordered deadline for filing the proof of claim.  The letter, which was not sent certified mail, was addressed
  to Mr. Navarre at his last known address.  Respondent took no subsequent action to ascertain whether his client
  responded in any respect, nor did respondent check with the plaintiffs' committee to determine if Mr. Navarre had
  registered.  Respondent did not send out a second letter or attempt to obtain another address for his
  client.<a name="_ftnref5" class="fn" href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">5</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In October 1999, Mr. Navarre filed a complaint with the ODC alleging respondent's neglect of his
  legal matter and failure to communicate.</p>

  <h3>Count VIII - Dorsey Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Dennis Dorsey retained respondent to represent him in a personal injury matter stemming from an
  accident which occurred on or about October 24, 1997.  Respondent filed suit on Mr. Dorsey's behalf on October 26,
  1998, but did not provide service instructions on his petition.  After filing the suit, respondent took no further
  action in the case.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Approximately two years after the suit was filed, Mr. Dorsey discharged respondent and retained
  new counsel.  On June 14, 2001, Mr. Dorsey's new counsel  requested in writing that respondent immediately send him
  Mr. Dorsey's file.  When respondent failed to comply, Mr. Dorsey filed a complaint with the ODC in August 2001. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent later testified at the formal hearing that he had sent the file on July 23, 2001, five
  weeks after Mr. Dorsey's new counsel made his request for such.  Additionally, respondent testified that he had only
  filed suit to interrupt prescription and that he personally thought it was a "bad case" that he did not think he
  could win.</p>

  <h3>Count X - Anderson Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In November 1998, Margaret Anderson retained respondent to represent her in a personal injury
  action arising from a November 15, 1998 incident at Bally's Casino.  Respondent filed suit on Ms. Anderson's behalf
  in June 1999, but failed to provide service instructions in the petition.  Respondent took no further action in the
  case, nor did he communicate with his client, despite her repeated attempts to contact him.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Almost three years after suit was filed, Ms. Anderson filed a complaint with the ODC, alleging
  she had learned respondent had not taken measures to have the defendants served.  In his response to the complaint,
  respondent maintained he filed suit on Ms. Anderson's behalf solely for the purpose of interrupting prescription,
  because "the liability picture was very poor."  Respondent pointed out that his client's claim was still viable and
  that he would voluntarily withdraw so she could retain other counsel to complete the matter.</p>

  <h3>Count XI - Smith Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent represented Dominica Smith in connection with a wrongful death suit.  In April 2001,
  Ms. Smith discharged respondent and requested a return of her file.  At the same time, she also retained other
  counsel, Randall J. Meyer, who also made numerous requests that respondent return the file.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In July 2001, Ms. Smith filed a complaint with the ODC, alleging that her case had been pending
  for over fifteen years and respondent had not returned her file to her new attorney.<a name="_ftnref6" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6">6</a> Respondent delivered the file to Mr. Meyer's office in October 2001, six months
  after respondent was discharged and the file was initially requested.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Following its investigation, the ODC filed the ten counts of formal charges against respondent at
  issue in this proceeding.  With the exception of the Williams and Smith matters which are the subject of Counts VI
  and XI, respectively, each of the counts of misconduct alleged violations of Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (lack of diligence) and <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to
  communicate) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  In the Dorsey and Smith matters (Counts VIII and XI), the ODC
  alleged a violation of Rule <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> (failure to protect clients interests at the
  termination of representation). In the Williams matter (Count VI), the ODC alleged violations of Rules 5.3(b)
  (failure to properly supervise non-lawyer assistants), <span class="allegedrules">5.5(b)</span> (assist a nonmember
  of the bar in the unauthorized practice of law) and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct
  prejudicial to the administration of justice).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After filing some incidental procedural motions, respondent filed an answer denying the
  allegations of misconduct.  The case then proceeded to a formal hearing.</p>

  <h3><span class="CITE"><a href="../HC/2003-02-04_02-db-035.htm">Recommendation of the Hearing
  Committee</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">At the conclusion of the formal hearing, the hearing committee filed a lengthy report finding
  clear and convincing evidence to support each of the formal charges.  Specifically, the committee recognized
  respondent admitted in most instances to the neglect of legal matters and failure to communicate in violation of
  Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span> and <span class="Rules">1.4</span>, respectively.  As to Counts VIII and XI
  relative to the Dorsey and Smith matters, the committee found respondent breached Rule 1.16 due to his failure to
  protect his clients' interests at the termination of their representations when he did not promptly return their
  files upon request.  Regarding respondent's failure to supervise his paralegal, the committee concluded respondent
  violated Rule <span class="Rules">5.3(b)</span> because Mr. Williams "participated in the deposition of respondent's
  client, and respondent knew Mr. Williams was suspended from the practice of law when he sent him to the deposition." 
  The committee determined respondent also assisted in Mr. Williams' unauthorized practice of law and engaged in
  conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rules <span class="Rules">5.5(b)</span> and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span>.  However, relying on <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Vaughan</i>, 01-1948 (La.
  10/26/01), <a href="2001-10-26_2001-1948.htm">801 So. 2d 1058</a></span>, and <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State
  Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain</i>, <a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 So. 2d 470</a> (La. 1991)</span>, the committee
  specifically noted it would not impose additional discipline for these violations because respondent received an
  admonition in 1999 for the same misconduct, which involved the use of Mr. Williams, who was suspended from practice,
  in a deposition during the same time period as the misconduct at issue in the instant matter.<a name="_ftnref7"
  class="fn" href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7">7</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On the issue of sanctions, the hearing committee recognized in aggravation respondent's
  <span class="ABAstandard">prior discipline</span>,<a name="_ftnref8" class="fn" href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8">8</a>
  <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>,<a name="_ftnref9" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9">9</a> <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the victims</span> and
  <span class="ABAstandard">lack of remorse</span>.  The committee relied on the mitigating factors of
  <span class="ABAstandard">personal or emotional problems</span> and <span class="ABAstandard">absence of selfish
  motive</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on its findings, the hearing committee recommended that respondent be suspended from the
  practice of law for three years, with two years deferred, subject to a two-year period of probation and
  conditions.</p>

  <h3><span class="CITE"><a href="../db/2003-09-19_02-DB-035.htm">Recommendation of the Disciplinary
  Board</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Following its independent review of the record, the disciplinary board adopted the findings of
  the hearing committee, except insofar as it concluded the committee erred in finding respondent violated Rule 1.4(a)
  in connection with the Francis matter (Count V).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Relying on the aggravating and mitigating factors cited by the hearing committee, the board
  recommended that respondent be suspended for one year, with six months deferred, subject to successful completion of
  the Louisiana State Bar Association's Ethics School program.  One board member dissented to the leniency of the
  proposed sanction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Both respondent and the ODC filed objections to the disciplinary board's recommendation. 
  Accordingly, the matter was docketed for briefing and argument in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect;
  11(G).</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court.  La. Const. art. V,
  &sect; 5(B).  Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence.  <i>In re: Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La.
  11/30/94), 646 So. 2d 343, 348; <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall</i>, 597 So. 2d  444, 445 (La. 1992).  While
  we are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we
  have held the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings.  <i>See</i>
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Caulfield</i>,  96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d
  714</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94),
  <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">We find the record supports the findings of the hearing committee, as modified by the
  disciplinary board. In essence, the common theme running through this case is respondent's neglect of legal matters
  and his failure to communicate with his clients.  Although respondent attempts to offer explanations and
  justifications for his actions, the fact remains that his conduct is in violation of the professional rules.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found evidence of professional misconduct, the next issue presented for our consideration
  is the appropriate sanction for respondent's actions.  In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary
  proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the
  profession and deter future misconduct.  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>,
  <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.  The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances.  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considered in isolation, none of respondent's transgressions are particularly egregious. 
  However, taken as a whole, they demonstrate a disturbing course of conduct. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In mitigation, respondent avers that the impact of his neglect of legal matters is lessened by
  the fact the suits he filed were without merit in the first place and were often filed simply to placate the
  client.<a name="_ftnref10" class="fn" href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10">10</a> Because these suits had little or no
  merit, he takes the position his failure to pursue them caused no significant harm to his clients.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">To the contrary, however, we find respondent's defense unacceptable.  The practice of filing
  suits which he knew to have no merit creates substantial harm on many different levels.  The practice of filing
  frivolous lawsuits impose a burden on the legal system and society at large.<a name="_ftnref11" class="fn"
  href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11">11</a> Such suits undermine public confidence in the legal system and exact a financial
  and emotional toll on the innocent targets of such filings.  The filing of meritless suits adversely impacts those
  litigants with legitimate and meritorious claims for whom justice is often delayed because time and resources of the
  legal system must be devoted to dispensing with those frivolous claims.  At the same time, the filing of a frivolous
  suit gives false hope to claimants who believe, however wrongly, that they have a claim.  Sometimes the best advice
  an attorney can give to his or her client is that no one is at fault and/or that there is no case to pursue.  To file
  suit merely to placate a client does a disservice to the client, the  legal system, and, ultimately, to society at
  large, which must bear the increased costs of an over-burdened legal system.  Accordingly, we decline to consider the
  lack of merit of the underlying suits as a factor which mitigates the seriousness of respondent's neglect of legal
  matters entrusted to him.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">However, we find other mitigating factors are present.  We recognize that respondent did not act
  with a dishonest or improper motive.  Additionally, at oral argument before this court, respondent's counsel
  represented that respondent has reassessed his practice methods and is committed to avoid similar problems in the
  future.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, we conclude the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct is a
  one-year suspension from the practice of law.  In light of the mitigating circumstances, we will defer six months of
  this suspension.  Following completion of the active portion of his suspension, respondent shall be placed on
  probation for a period of one year, during which time he shall complete the  Louisiana State Bar Association's Ethics
  School program.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Louis A. Gerdes, Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 6030, is suspended
  from the practice of law for a period of one year.  Six months of this suspension shall be deferred.  Following the
  completion of the active portion of his suspension, respondent shall be placed on probation for a period of one year,
  during which time he shall be required to attend the Louisiana State Bar Association's Ethics School program.  Any
  violation of this condition or any other misconduct during the probationary period may be grounds for making the
  deferred portion of the suspension executory or imposing other discipline, as appropriate.  All costs and expenses in
  the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10.1, with legal interest to
  commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn1" class="fn" href="#_ftnref1" id="_ftn1">1</a> The ODC initially filed eleven
  counts of misconduct against respondent.  However, one count, Count IX, was dismissed prior to the formal hearing. 
  The ODC has not sought review of this dismissal.  Accordingly, we will not discuss Count IX in this opinion.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn2" class="fn" href="#_ftnref2" id="_ftn2">2</a> The Browns are the children of
  Sandra Ricard subject of Count II.  The hearing committee incorrectly stated they were the children of the
  complainant subject of Count I.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn3" class="fn" href="#_ftnref3" id="_ftn3">3</a> The complaint alleged neglect of
  legal matters and the ODC instituted charges citing a violation of Rule 1.3.  However, the hearing committee and
  disciplinary board found insufficient evidence of neglect.  The ODC did not object to the dismissal of the
  allegation.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn4" class="fn" href="#_ftnref4" id="_ftn4">4</a> In 1986, Mr. Williams was
  suspended from the practice of law for a minimum of two years. <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Williams</i>, 498 So.
  2d 727 (La. 1986).  The charges alleged that Mr. Williams engaged in a conflict of interest when he entered into a
  business transaction with a client without making full disclosure or advising his client to seek independent legal
  advice, charged an excessive legal fee in a worker's compensation case and neglected a legal matter.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn5" class="fn" href="#_ftnref5" id="_ftn5">5</a> Respondent admitted at the
  formal hearing that his only responsibility in the entire class action litigation was to ensure his client timely
  registered for the class with a proof of claim.  The plaintiffs' litigation committee handled all other
  responsibilities.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn6" class="fn" href="#_ftnref6" id="_ftn6">6</a> This was Ms. Smith's second
  complaint filed against respondent.  Initially, she filed a complaint in 1998 alleging neglect and a failure to
  communicate.  Respondent submitted a response to the ODC.  It appears the ODC found insufficient evidence to pursue
  the matter further.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn7" class="fn" href="#_ftnref7" id="_ftn7">7</a> Mr. Williams was ultimately
  suspended from the practice of law for two years, with all but one year and one day deferred, for participating in a
  deposition in April 1998 in an unrelated matter while employed for Mr. Gerdes as a paralegal.  <i>In re:
  Williams</i>, 02-2698 (La. 4/9/03), 842 So. 2d 353.  Additionally, the disciplinary board admonished respondent in
  1999 for the same incident giving rise to Mr. Williams' suspension.  <i>In re: Gerdes</i>, 99-ADB-071.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn8" class="fn" href="#_ftnref8" id="_ftn8">8</a> Respondent has been admonished
  on two prior occasions.  In addition to respondent's 1999 admonishment for using Mr. Williams, a suspended attorney,
  at a deposition, respondent was admonished in 1995 for a violation of Rules 1.8(e) (offering of financial assistance
  to client in connection with litigation), 1.15(a) (commingling) and 1.15(d) (failure to maintain interest-bearing
  client trust account) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  See, 95-ADB-038.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn9" class="fn" href="#_ftnref9" id="_ftn9">9</a> Respondent was admitted to the
  practice of law in Louisiana in 1968, approximately thirty-four years at the time of the misconduct at issue in these
  proceedings.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn10" class="fn" href="#_ftnref10" id="_ftn10">10</a> Respondent explained that he
  accepted 300-400 cases per year and sometimes got "stuck" with cases he should not have taken.  During testimony
  before the hearing committee, respondent stated that in the Ricard matter, he filed suit although he acknowledged "I
  did not think I could win the case; I did not think there was a claim."  He further stated, "the case was so bad, so
  impossible to win, that I did [her] a favor by filing a suit to protect her interests so at least she had a right to
  proceed."  In the Dorsey matter, he stated he filed suit despite the fact that he thought it was a "bad case" in
  which he could not prevail.</p>

    <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">In re: LOUIS A. GERDES, JR.</p>

    <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">CALOGERO, C.J., dissents and assigns reasons.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">I dissent from the sanction imposed in this case.  I would impose a suspension of three months,
    which I consider a sufficient penalty for this respondent's conduct.  The respondent practices in an urban area
    with many disadvantaged clients, and while that fact does not excuse his conduct, it helps to explain, perhaps, his
    error in taking on cases of questionable merit.  Furthermore, as the majority concedes, none of the respondent's
    transgressions is particularly egregious, and the respondent did not act with a dishonest or improper motive. 
    Moreover, the respondent through counsel has asserted that he has taken steps to avoid future problems regarding
    the filing of non-meritorious lawsuits.  Accordingly, in my view a three-month suspension would be an appropriate
    sanction.</p>
