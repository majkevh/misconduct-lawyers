  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 04-B-0444</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: LINWARD J. MARTIN, III</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from a total of 42 counts of formal charges filed by the Office
  of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against the respondent, Linward Martin, III, who is currently on interim suspension
  for threat of harm to the public.<a name="fnref1" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On December 12, 2001, the ODC filed thirty-four counts of formal charges against respondent in
  the matter bearing the disciplinary board's docket number 01-DB-119. These charges were amended on January 22, 2002
  to add two additional counts. On November 21, 2002, the ODC filed a second set of six counts of formal charges
  against respondent in the disciplinary board's docket number 02-DB-121. The two sets of formal charges were
  considered by separate hearing committees, then consolidated pursuant to an order of this court rendered on July 30,
  2003. <span class="cite">In re: Martin, 03-0818 (La. 7/30/03), ___ So. 2d ___</span>. On February 19, 2004, the
  disciplinary board filed in this court a single recommendation of discipline encompassing both matters involving
  respondent.</p>

  <h3>01-DB-119</h3>

  <h4>Counts 1 and 2</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In October 1999, respondent settled a worker's compensation claim on behalf of Delorise
  Henderson. Respondent had previously received written notice of a statutory lien for medical services provided to his
  client by Dr. Anthony Zuppardo, and by letter dated September 28, 1999, respondent agreed to protect Dr. Zuppardo's
  interest in the settlement of the worker's compensation claim. Nevertheless, respondent failed to pay the sums owed
  to Dr. Zuppardo, totaling $1,222.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In August 2000, Dr. Zuppardo filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. Respondent
  answered the complaint in September 2000, advising that he would pay Dr. Zuppardo. Thereafter, the ODC requested
  additional information concerning the matter, but respondent failed to reply to the supplemental requests for
  information.</p>

  <h4>Count 3</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent represented Adam Sylve in a worker's compensation claim against his former employer.
  In April 2000, respondent settled Mr. Sylve's claim for $55,000. Mr. Sylve was unaware of the settlement and did not
  approve it. In August 2000, Mr. Sylve confronted respondent after learning of the settlement from the worker's
  compensation judge. During the meeting, respondent confessed to Mr. Sylve that he had received the settlement
  proceeds, but was having financial problems and had spent the money. At respondent's urging, Mr. Sylve signed a
  "Memorandum of Understanding," stating that respondent's law firm <a name="fnref2" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a>
  would disburse Mr. Sylve's portion of the settlement to him in four installments over a period of time. Respondent
  gave Mr. Sylve four post-dated checks drawn on the law firm's client trust account. When Mr. Sylve presented the
  first check for payment on August 30, 2000, there were insufficient funds in the account to cover the check; two
  weeks later, the firm's bank froze the trust account.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Sylve reported respondent's conduct to the Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office. On
  October 13, 2000, respondent was arrested and charged with felony theft, a violation of La. R.S. 14:67(A), stemming
  from the Sylve matter. State v. Martin, No. 419-252 on the docket of the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court. On
  July 9, 2001, respondent pleaded guilty as charged. On September 17, 2001, respondent was sentenced to serve five
  years at hard labor, suspended, and placed on active probation for five years. Respondent was also ordered to serve
  52 weekends in Orleans Parish Prison beginning September 21, 2001 and ordered to pay $47,500 in restitution to Mr.
  Sylve.</p>

  <h4>Count 4</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In September 2000, Mr. Sylve filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On September 26,
  2000, the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to the
  complaint. The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on September 5, 2001 and
  answer the complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear on that date.</p>

  <h4>Count 5</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In June 2000, respondent was retained to represent Bryan Saulsberry in a worker's compensation
  claim against his former employer. Respondent failed to communicate with Mr. Saulsberry for a period of time, but by
  September 2000, he had settled the worker's compensation claim for $24,000. Upon receipt of the settlement check,
  respondent deposited the funds into his law firm's operating account, rather than a client trust account.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On September 5, 2000, respondent gave Mr. Saulsberry a cashier's check representing a portion of
  his share of the settlement, and paid the remainder with a post-dated check of $700 drawn on the firm's operating
  account. When Mr. Saulsberry presented the $700 check for payment on September 8, 2000, there were insufficient funds
  in the account to cover the check. Mr. Saulsberry complained to respondent, who said that he would replace the check
  with a cash payment of $700 on September 11, 2000; however, respondent could not be located on that date. On
  September 15, 2000, Mr. Saulsberry deposited the $700 check into his own bank account. The check was subsequently
  returned by the drawee bank marked "Account Closed."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Saulsberry reported respondent's conduct to the Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office. On
  March 12, 2001, respondent was arrested and charged with issuing worthless checks over $500, a violation of La. R.S.
  14:71(A), stemming from the Saulsberry matter. State v. Martin, No. 421-356 on the docket of the Orleans Parish
  Criminal District Court. On September 17, 2001, respondent pleaded guilty as charged and was sentenced to serve three
  years at hard labor, suspended, and placed on active probation for three years.<a name="fnref3" href="#fn3"
  id="fnref3">3</a> Respondent was also ordered to serve 52 weekends in Orleans Parish Prison beginning September 21,
  2001 and ordered to pay $715 in restitution to Mr. Saulsberry.</p>

  <h4>Count 6</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In September 2000, Mr. Saulsberry filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On October
  23, 2000, the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to
  the complaint. The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on January 4, 2001 and
  answer the complaint under oath. Respondent appeared on that date, but failed to produce the records that had been
  requested in conjunction with the ODC's investigation. Respondent promised to produce the records, but did not do so,
  necessitating the issuance of a second subpoena.</p>

  <h4>Counts 7 and 8</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent represented a number of clients whom he referred to Dr. Steven Katz for evaluation and
  medical treatment. Respondent agreed to protect Dr. Katz's interest in the settlement of the clients' personal injury
  or worker's compensation claims. Nevertheless, respondent failed to pay the sums owed to Dr. Katz.<a name="fnref4"
  href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In September 2000, Dr. Katz filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On November 6,
  2000, the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to the
  complaint. The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on January 18, 2001 and
  answer the complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear on that date, but agreed to appear on February 2, 2001.
  On that date, respondent failed to produce the records that had been requested in conjunction with the ODC's
  investigation.</p>

  <h4>Counts 9 and 10</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In June 2000, Dorothy Brown retained respondent to represent her in two personal injury matters.
  Respondent periodically failed to communicate with Ms. Brown, but for the most part, he assured her that her cases
  were moving forward. Ms. Brown eventually learned that respondent had failed to enroll as her counsel of record and
  had failed to notify her of a deposition in one of the cases, despite receiving service of a subpoena on at least two
  occasions. As a result of respondent's neglect, Ms. Brown's cases were delayed.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In February 2001, Ms. Brown filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On March 19, 2001,
  the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to the
  complaint. The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on September 5, 2001 and
  answer the complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear on that date.</p>

  <h4>Counts 11 and 12</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In early 1998, Katherine Turnipseed paid respondent $2,000 to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy
  proceeding on her behalf. Respondent filed the petition and supporting schedules, but in March 1998, the case was
  dismissed by the Bankruptcy Court for respondent's failure to file a timely bankruptcy plan. Thereafter, respondent
  filed four more bankruptcy proceedings on behalf of Ms. Turnipseed, and forged her signature on the pleadings filed
  in connection with these proceedings. Between August 1998 and October 2000, all of these cases were dismissed by the
  Bankruptcy Court for respondent's failure to file a timely bankruptcy plan, failure to pay filing fees, or failure to
  attend the requisite meeting of creditors. Ms. Turnipseed eventually lost her home in foreclosure and suffered a poor
  credit rating due to her numerous bankruptcy filings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In March 2001, Ms. Turnipseed filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On April 3,
  2001, the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to the
  complaint. The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on September 5, 2001 and
  answer the complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear on that date.</p>

  <h4>Counts 13 and 14</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In August 1999, Mark Thomas Rihner retained respondent to represent him in a worker's
  compensation and personal injury matter. Respondent filed suit on Mr. Rihner's behalf, but failed to pay the filing
  fees to the clerk of court and failed to request that the petition be served upon the defendants. Respondent took no
  further action in the case and failed to communicate with his client, forcing Mr. Rihner to retain new counsel.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In March 2001, Mr. Rihner filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On April 18, 2001,
  the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to the
  complaint. The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on September 5, 2001 and
  answer the complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear on that date.</p>

  <h4>Counts 15 and 16</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 1999, Ronald Higgins retained respondent to represent him in two separate legal matters.
  Respondent neglected the matters, failed to communicate with Mr. Higgins, and failed to return Mr. Higgins'
  files.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In April 2001, Mr. Higgins filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On May 8, 2001, the
  ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to the complaint.
  The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on September 5, 2001 and answer the
  complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear on that date.</p>

  <h4>Counts 17 and 18</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 2000, Sidney Domangue paid respondent $700 to file a bankruptcy proceeding on his behalf.
  Respondent failed to communicate with Mr. Domangue and did not file the bankruptcy, forcing Mr. Domangue to retain
  new counsel. Respondent also failed to refund the unearned fee he was paid.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In April 2001, Mr. Domangue filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On May 17, 2001,
  the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to the
  complaint. The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on September 5, 2001 and
  answer the complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear on that date.</p>

  <h4>Count 19</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On May 2, 2001, respondent was interimly suspended from the practice of law by order of this
  court in In re: Martin, 01-1189 (La. 5/2/01), 787 So. 2d 282. On May 3, 2001, respondent filed a petition seeking a
  temporary restraining order in an attempt to halt foreclosure proceedings against his client, Linda Johnson Wright.
  Standard Mortgage Corp. v. Linda Johnson A/K/A Linda Wright, No. 99-11656 on the docket of the Civil District Court
  for the Parish of Orleans. In his petition, respondent falsely asserted that Mrs. Wright had not been served with
  notification of the sheriff's sale of the property at issue. The trial court issued a temporary restraining order on
  May 3, 2001 and ordered that a hearing on permanent injunctive relief be held on May 14, 2001. Respondent failed to
  attend the hearing. The mortgage company was subsequently awarded attorney's fees against respondent for various
  procedural defects in the TRO and in light of the false representations contained therein.</p>

  <h4>Count 20</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In conjunction with the conduct subject of Count 19, a complaint was filed against respondent by
  counsel for Standard Mortgage Corporation. On May 31, 2001, the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent
  by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to the complaint. The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena
  compelling him to appear on September 5, 2001 and answer the complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear on
  that date.</p>

  <h4>Count 21</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On May 17, 2001, respondent was suspended from practice before the United States Bankruptcy Court
  for the Eastern District of Louisiana for his misconduct in numerous bankruptcy proceedings. In seven cases,
  respondent forged the debtors' signatures on pleadings and failed to attend hearings, and as a result, contempt
  orders imposing sanctions were entered against him by the court. Furthermore, in three cases, the debtors' bankruptcy
  proceedings were dismissed due to respondent's failure to file a mailing matrix or a timely plan, or his failure to
  pay filing fees even though fees had been tendered to him in advance. Finally, on May 3, 2001, the day after
  respondent was interimly suspended from the practice of law by order of this court, he attempted to file a pro se
  petition on behalf of a debtor when he had prepared the petition but had not included his name as attorney of record.
  The clerk of the Bankruptcy Court refused to accept the petition.</p>

  <h4>Count 22</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In conjunction with the conduct subject of Count 21, a complaint was filed against respondent by
  United States Bankruptcy Judge Jerry A. Brown. On May 31, 2001, the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to
  respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to the complaint. The ODC thereafter served respondent with
  a subpoena compelling him to appear on September 5, 2001 and answer the complaint under oath. Respondent failed to
  appear on that date.</p>

  <h4>Counts 23 and 24</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Morris Bigner retained respondent to handle a worker's compensation claim on his behalf. In the
  course of the litigation, respondent requested and received a copy of the transcript of a deposition given by Mr.
  Bigner in July 2000. However, respondent failed to pay the court reporter for the costs of the transcript, despite
  numerous requests. In January 2001, the court reporter demanded that Mr. Bigner pay for the transcript. Respondent
  assured Mr. Bigner that he would handle the matter, but he failed to do so. In March 2001, after he was threatened
  with a lawsuit by the court reporter for non-payment of the outstanding costs, Mr. Bigner personally paid the sum of
  $167.70.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In May 2001, Mr. Bigner filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On June 20, 2001, the
  ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to the complaint.
  The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on September 5, 2001 and answer the
  complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear on that date.</p>

  <h4>Counts 25 and 26</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In May 1999, William Enines retained respondent to represent him in a personal injury matter.
  Respondent neglected the matter and failed to communicate with Mr. Enines.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In May 2001, Mr. Enines filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On June 20, 2001, the
  ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to the complaint.
  The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on September 5, 2001 and answer the
  complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear on that date.</p>

  <h4>Counts 27 and 28</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Robert and Eileen James paid respondent $1,000 to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding on
  their behalf. Respondent filed the initial pleadings but did not file a proper mailing matrix; he also failed to pay
  the appropriate filing fees to the Bankruptcy Court, even though the fees were paid by Mr. and Mrs. James in advance.
  As a result, their bankruptcy case was dismissed. Mr. and Mrs. James were forced to retain new counsel to complete
  their bankruptcy, and they were faced with possible foreclosure on their home due to respondent's inaction. To date,
  respondent has not refunded the legal fee Mr. and Mrs. James paid, and he has not returned their file.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In June 2001, Mr. James filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On June 28, 2001, the
  ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to the complaint.

  <p class="Bodycopy">Karen Thomas retained respondent to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding on her behalf. She
  paid respondent $200 in attorney's fees and $185 in filing fees, but respondent remitted only $5 in filing fees to

  bankruptcy proceeding. As a result, Ms. Thomas was forced to retain new counsel.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In June 2001, Ms. Thomas filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On July 11, 2001, the
  ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to the complaint.

  complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear on that date.</p>

  <h4>Counts 31 and 32</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 1997, Michael James retained respondent to handle a personal injury matter. Respondent filed
  suit on Mr. James' behalf, but failed to request that the petition be served upon the defendants. As a result, Mr.
  James' suit was dismissed without prejudice in 1999. Respondent took no further action in the case and failed to
  communicate with his client.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In July 2001, Mr. James filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On July 18, 2001, the
  ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to the complaint.

  <h4>Counts 33 and 34</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Desiree Black retained respondent to handle a worker's compensation claim against her employer.
  On June 19, 2000, Ms. Black met with respondent to execute an affidavit relative to the proposed settlement of the
  case. Respondent informed Ms. Black that her claim would be compromised for $4,000 and that he would contact her upon
  his receipt of the settlement check and related documents. Thereafter, Ms. Black made numerous attempts to contact
  respondent, to no avail. Ms. Black then consulted another attorney for assistance. Ms. Black subsequently learned
  that her worker's compensation claim had been settled by respondent on July 24, 2000 and that the settlement check
  and related documents had been hand-delivered to respondent on July 25, 2000. The $4,000 settlement check was
  endorsed by both payees, "Desiree Black and her attorney, Linward Martin, III," and cashed on July 26, 2000. However,
  Ms. Black did not endorse the settlement check, nor did she receive any portion of the proceeds of the settlement of
  her worker's compensation claim.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In June 2001, the ODC received a complaint against respondent filed on behalf of Ms.
  Black.<a name="fnref5" href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a> On July 26, 2001, the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to

  <p class="Bodycopy">In March 2000, Audrey Applewhite, a resident of Mississippi, retained respondent to handle a
  worker's compensation claim for her brother, who is physically and mentally incapacitated. Respondent neglected the
  matter, failed to communicate with Ms. Applewhite, and failed to return Ms. Applewhite's file.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In September 2001, Ms. Applewhite filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On October
  30, 2001, the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail. Respondent failed to reply to

  <h4>Count 3</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 1999, Lynette Pierce retained respondent to represent her in a claim for damages arising out
  of an automobile accident. Respondent presumably accepted the representation on a contingent fee basis, but he did
  not provide Ms. Pierce with a written agreement to that effect.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent did not diligently handle the property damage portion of Ms. Pierce's case; it was
  almost a year after the accident before Ms. Pierce was compensated for the damage to her vehicle. Respondent
  eventually settled Ms. Pierce's personal injury claim for $5,800. Respondent failed to account to Ms. Pierce for the
  proceeds of her settlement, but he paid her $3,900 and told her that her medical expenses would be paid by the
  tortfeasor's insurer in a separate check. In September 2001, Ms. Pierce received correspondence from an attorney
  representing one of her medical providers, seeking to collect unpaid medical expenses in the amount of $3,824 plus
  interest, costs, and attorney's fees.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In addition to the matter arising out of the automobile accident, Ms. Pierce requested that
  respondent file suit on her behalf against a mortgage company. Respondent never filed the lawsuit, but instead
  recommended that Ms. Pierce file for bankruptcy to keep from losing her home in a foreclosure proceeding. Respondent
  requested $185 for filing fees, which Ms. Pierce paid in February 2001; however, Ms. Pierce later learned that
  respondent had been suspended from practicing in Bankruptcy Court and that her bankruptcy case was dismissed for
  respondent's failure to file a proper mailing matrix. Ms. Pierce also learned that respondent had remitted only $5 in
  filing fees to the Bankruptcy Court and, without her consent, had requested permission to pay the filing fees in
  installments.</p>

  <h4>Count 4</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In conjunction with the conduct subject of Count 3, Ms. Pierce filed complaints against
  respondent with the ODC. On February 20, 2002, and again on March 5, 2002, the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaints
  to respondent by certified and regular United States mail. Respondent failed to reply to the complaints. The ODC
  thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on May 2, 2002 and answer the complaints under
  oath. Respondent failed to appear on that date.</p>

  <h4>Counts 5 and 6</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In November 1996, Gerald Barnes retained respondent to handle a worker's compensation claim on
  his behalf. Respondent referred Mr. Barnes for medical treatment and made contact with the insurance company involved
  in the claim, but thereafter, he neglected the case and failed to communicate with Mr. Barnes. In September 2000,
  respondent gave Mr. Barnes a $150 check to assist him in paying his child support; however, the check was returned
  NSF. Mr. Barnes subsequently discharged respondent and requested the return of his files. Respondent failed to comply
  with Mr. Barnes' request.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In January 2002, Mr. Barnes filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On February 20,
  2002, and again on March 13, 2002, the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified and regular
  United States mail. Respondent failed to reply to the complaint.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As previously noted, the ODC filed two separate sets of formal charges against respondent.
  Collectively, the 42 counts of formal charges allege numerous violations by respondent of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct, as follows: Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.1(a)</span> (failure to provide competent representation to a
  client), <span class="allegedrules">1.2</span> (scope of the representation), <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span>
  (failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.5</span>
  (fee arrangements), <span class="allegedrules">1.15(a)</span>(b) (safekeeping property of clients or third persons),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> (obligations upon termination of the representation),
  <span class="allegedrules">3.1</span> (meritorious claims and contentions), <span class="allegedrules">3.2</span>
  (failure to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation), <span class="allegedrules">3.3(a)</span> (candor toward
  the tribunal), <span class="allegedrules">3.4(b)</span> (a lawyer shall not falsify evidence),
  <span class="allegedrules">3.4(c)</span> (knowing disobedience of an obligation under the rules of a tribunal),
  <span class="allegedrules">5.5(a)</span> (engaging in the unauthorized practice of law),
  <span class="allegedrules">7.3(d)</span> (lawyers shall not state or imply that they practice in a partnership or
  other organization when that is not the fact), <span class="allegedrules">8.1(a)</span> (knowingly making a false
  statement of material fact in connection with a disciplinary matter), <span class="allegedrules">8.1(b)</span>
  (knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(b)</span> (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on the lawyer's honesty,
  trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving
  dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct
  prejudicial to the administration of justice), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate
  with the ODC in its investigation).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was served with both sets of formal charges. He failed to answer or otherwise reply to
  the formal charges. Accordingly, the factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear
  and convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). No formal hearing was held, but the parties
  were given an opportunity to file with the hearing committee written arguments and documentary evidence on the issue
  of sanctions. Respondent filed nothing for the hearing committee's consideration in either matter.</p>

  <h3>Hearing Committee Recommendations</h3>

  <h4><a href="../HC/2002-08-06_01-DB-119.htm">01-DB-119</a></h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee adopted the facts and rule violations as set forth in the formal charges.
  Finding no mitigating factors are present, the committee recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred. The
  committee further recommended that respondent be ordered to pay restitution and that he be charged with all costs and
  expenses of these disciplinary proceedings.</p>

  <h4><a href="../HC/2003-07-21_02-DB-121.htm">02-DB-121</a></h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee generally agreed that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct
  as charged in the formal charges. The committee recommended that respondent be disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the hearing committees' recommendations.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-02-18_01-DB-119.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the consolidated matters, the disciplinary board agreed that the facts alleged
  and deemed admitted support a finding that respondent violated each professional rule cited in the formal charges
  (though not in every instance where the rule was cited). The board found respondent violated duties owed to his
  clients, to the legal system, to the public, and as a professional. Respondent's conduct was knowing in some
  instances and intentional in others. As a result of his conduct, respondent caused actual damage, which was serious
  or potentially serious, to his clients whose legal matters were neglected, delayed, dismissed, and abandoned. As a
  result of respondent's misconduct, some clients lost their causes of action, while others have suffered bad credit
  ratings, foreclosure on their homes, and garnishment of their wages. Respondent stole money from his clients, and for
  the most part has failed to pay restitution. His criminal acts caused serious injury not only to his clients, but
  also to the public and the legal profession. He damaged the profession, his clients, and the courts by engaging in
  the unauthorized practice of law when he knew or should have known he was on interim suspension. He also caused
  damage to the legal system by failing to expedite litigation, failing to follow court procedures, and by submitting
  an affidavit he knew or should have known contained false information. Additionally, respondent's failure to respond
  to the ODC's requests delayed the disciplinary process, diverted its limited resources, and impaired the system's
  orderly functioning. Considering the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, as well as the prior
  jurisprudence involving multiple counts of conversion, neglect, failure to communicate, lack of candor, the
  unauthorized practice of law, and dishonest and criminal behavior, the board determined that the baseline sanction
  for respondent's misconduct is disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In aggravation, the board recognized respondent's dishonest or selfish motive, a pattern of
  misconduct, multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding, deceptive practices during the
  disciplinary process, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, vulnerability of the victims, and
  indifference to making restitution. The board found no mitigating factors are present.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In light of the seriousness of respondent's misconduct, and considering the absence of mitigating
  factors, the board then turned to a discussion of the sanction of permanent disbarment. Respondent's conduct fits
  within Guideline 1 of the permanent disbarment guidelines, which provides for permanent disbarment when an attorney
  engages in "repeated or multiple instances of intentional conversion of client funds with substantial harm." The
  facts as admitted suggest that respondent intentionally converted client funds on at least three occasions - in Count
  3 of 01-DB-119, respondent converted $47,500 from Mr. Sylve; in Count 5, he converted $700 from Mr. Saulsberry; and
  in Count 33, he converted Ms. Black's settlement check in the amount of $4,000. <a name="fnref6" href="#fn6"
  id="fnref6">6</a> Furthermore, Guideline 8 is applicable. That guideline provides that permanent disbarment may be
  warranted for an attorney who practices law "following notice" of suspension. The deemed admitted facts suggest that
  respondent practiced law after he knew or should have known he had been placed on interim suspension.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Concluding that respondent's conduct is "some of the most serious professional misconduct an
  attorney can commit," and that respondent is a threat to his clients, the profession, and the public, the board
  recommended respondent be permanently disbarred. The board further recommended that respondent be required to account
  to the complainants and make restitution as appropriate, and that he be assessed with all costs and expenses of these
  proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316
  (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The deemed admitted facts in this case reveal a pattern of professional misconduct that is
  unquestionably serious in nature and in scope. Respondent neglected the legal matters of numerous clients, failed to
  communicate with his clients, failed to account for and refund unearned fees, failed to timely pay third-party
21
  medical providers, engaged in the unauthorized practice of law after being placed on interim suspension by this
  court, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in more than twenty separate disciplinary investigations. Respondent has
  also been convicted of felony criminal charges stemming from his conversion of funds belonging to two clients. All
  told, respondent's conduct violates Rules <span class="Rules">1.1(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.2</span>,
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4</span>, <span class="Rules">1.5</span>,
  <span class="Rules">1.15</span>, <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span>, <span class="Rules">3.1</span>,
  <span class="Rules">3.2</span>, <span class="Rules">3.3(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">3.4(b)</span>,
  <span class="Rules">3.4(c)</span>, <span class="Rules">5.5(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">7.3(d)</span>,
  <span class="Rules">8.1(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.1(b)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span>,
  <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(b)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span>,
  <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional misconduct, we now turn to a determination of the appropriate sanction
  for respondent's actions. In considering that issue, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to
  maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future
  misconduct. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d
  1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of
  the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a>
  (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's misconduct represents a significant breach of his professional duties and
  obligations. Indeed, we have seldom been called upon to discipline a lawyer who possesses such a complete and total
  disregard for the welfare of his clients, the public, the legal system, and our profession. We find the following
  aggravating factors are present in this case: <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">a pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the victims</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">indifference to making
  restitution</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">illegal conduct</span>. We are unable to discern a single
  mitigating factor from the voluminous record before us.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, it is clear that disbarment is appropriate. The sole remaining
  question is whether respondent's conduct is so egregious that he should be permanently prohibited from seeking
  readmission to the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In Appendix E to Supreme Court Rule XIX, we set forth guidelines illustrating the types of
  conduct which might warrant permanent disbarment. While these guidelines are not intended to bind this court in its
  decision-making process, they present useful information concerning the types of conduct we might consider worthy of
  permanent disbarment. For purposes of the instant case, Guidelines 1 and 8 are relevant. Those guidelines
  provide:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"><span class="Guidelines">GUIDELINE 1</span>. Repeated or multiple instances of intentional
  conversion of client funds with substantial harm. <span class="Guidelines">GUIDELINE 8</span>. Following notice,
  engaging in the unauthorized practice of law subsequent to resigning from the Bar Association, or during the period
  of time in which the lawyer is suspended from the practice of law or disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Guideline 1 is clearly applicable to this case. Respondent converted more than $50,000 in
  settlement funds owed to his clients. His failure to account for and refund unearned legal fees also resulted in a
  conversion of funds to the detriment of his clients. When this conduct is considered in light of respondent's
  demonstrated indifference to making restitution in these matters, the substantial harm is apparent. Likewise,
  Guideline 8 is implicated, as the undisputed evidence shows respondent continued to represent clients after his
  license to practice law was suspended by this court in May 2001.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">These proceedings have convincingly established that respondent does not possess the moral
  fitness to practice law and that he poses a threat of danger to the public in the event he is permitted to resume
  practicing law. Respondent has disregarded and ignored his obligation to uphold the high standards of honesty and
  righteousness that he assumed when he took the oath as a member of the bar of this state.
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Haylon, <a href="1967-05-01_48167.htm">250 La. 651, 198 So. 2d 391,
  392</a> (1967)</span>. He has used his law license not to foster the high standards of the profession, but to exploit
  his clients for his own benefit. This court cannot and will not tolerate such conduct. Without question, respondent
  must be permanently disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board's recommendation and impose permanent
  disbarment.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committees and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that the name of Linward Joseph Martin, III, Louisiana Bar Roll number
  24542, be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be
  revoked. Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered that respondent be permanently prohibited
  from being readmitted to the practice of law in this state. Respondent is ordered to furnish complete accountings and
  full restitution to the clients and third persons subject of the formal charges. All costs and expenses in the matter
  are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence
  thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
