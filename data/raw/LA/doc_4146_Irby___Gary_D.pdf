&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the record of the disciplinary board's findings and recommendations, and the record filed herein, it is the decision of the court that the disciplinary board's recommendations be adopted.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accordingly, it is ordered that the name of G. Don Irby be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the state of Louisiana be revoked.<br>
