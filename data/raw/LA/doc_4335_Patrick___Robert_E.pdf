  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE ROBERT E. PATRICK.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM. (<a href="#fn_" name="fnref_" id="fnref_">FN*</a>)</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from five counts of formal charges the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") filed against respondent, Robert E. Patrick, an attorney licensed to practice law in the
  State of Louisiana. <a name="fnref1" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">(FN1)</a>? The charges allege respondent failed to
  maintain an appropriate balance in his client trust account, then modified copies of bank statements he produced to
  the ODC in an attempt to hide his wrongdoing.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <h3>Count I</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent served as closing notary in a real estate transaction on August 16, 1996, involving
  Kathy S. Kingsland, the seller.? The transaction resulted in the production of a check in the amount of $22,275.00.?
  Respondent was to use $15,709.26 to pay off Ms. Kingsland's mortgage, and at least $2,920.00 was owed? to Ms.
  Kingsland.? Respondent did not pay off the mortgage until October 18, 1996, and he did not completely disburse the
  remaining funds from the transaction until December of 1996.? Between August 16 and October 18, 1996, the balance on
  respondent's trust account fell below $19,415.00, the minimum amount that should have remained before the appropriate
  disbursements had taken place.</p>

  <h3>Count II</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In response to Ms. Kingsland's complaint, respondent attached copies of purported bank statements
  from his trust or escrow account and submitted these to the ODC.? However, the statements were altered in the
  following ways: respondent altered the September statement by changing the correct new balance of $15,403.45 to
  reflect a false balance of $25,898.28 on page one, and by removing the periodic balances from page two; the October,
  1996 statement was altered to change the correct balance of $15,403.45 to an incorrect balance of $25,898.28 on page
  one, and by removing the periodic balances from page two of the statement.</p>

  <h3>Count III</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC served respondent with a subpoena, issued pursuant to the authority of the Supreme Court
  of Louisiana, ordering him to appear before the ODC on February 27, 1997 to testify and to produce financial records
  relating to Ms. Kingsland's complaint.? Respondent failed to appear and testify pursuant to the subpoena.</p>

  <h3>Count IV</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On June 5, 1995, respondent settled a personal injury case on behalf of Yolanne B. Mitchell, and
  he withheld from the settlement proceeds the sum of $628.72 to pay the England Masse Chiropractic Clinic.? The clinic
  rejected this amount when tendered, claiming it was only a partial payment.? Furthermore, that amount was submitted
  to the clinic on or about February 13, 1997, well after the ODC had instigated its investigation.? Respondent should
  have maintained this amount in his trust account between June 9, 1995 and February 13, 1997; however, his balance
  fell below $628.72 on several occasions between June 9, 1995 and February 29, 1996. <a name="fnref2" href="#fn2"
  id="fnref2">(FN2)</a></p>

  <h3>Count V</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In response to Ms. Mitchell's complaint, respondent produced copies of bank statements from his
  trust account covering the period between June 1, 1995 and February 29, 1996.? The bank statements had been altered
  as follows: respondent removed the periodic balances from each page two of the June, 1995 through</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">February, 1996 monthly bank statements, and also removed the NSF and overdrawn fee charges from
  the November, 1995 statement; respondent altered the August and September, 1995 statements by changing the correct
  balance of $271.54 to reflect a balance of $3,892.35; respondent altered the October and November,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">1995 statements to remove the correct balance of $13.73 to reflect an incorrect balance of
  $13,463.80; respondent also altered the November and December, 1995 statements by removing a correct balance of
  $356.03 and replacing it with a false amount of $6,670.60.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC instituted formal charges against the respondent, alleging violations of Rule
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (reasonable diligence); Rule <span class="allegedrules">1.15 (a)(b)(c)</span>
  (safekeeping of client property); <span class="allegedrules">3.1</span> (meritorious claims and contentions); Rule
  <span class="allegedrules">3.3(a)(1)(2) and (4)</span> (making false statements of fact or law to a tribunal,
  offering evidence the lawyer knows to be false); Rule <span class="allegedrules">3.4(a)(b)(c)</span> (unlawfully
  obstructing another party's access to evidence, falsifying evidence, and knowingly disobeying an obligation under the
  rules of a tribunal); <span class="allegedrules">8.1(a)(b)(c)</span> (knowingly making false statements of material
  fact or failing to disclose material facts, and failing to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation); and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4 (a)(b)(c)(d) and (g)</span> (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct, committing a
  crime that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or
  misrepresentation, engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice, and failing to cooperate
  with the Committee on Professional Responsibility) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, as well as Supreme Court
  <span class="allegedrules">Rule XIX, ? 9(c)</span>. <a name="fnref3" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">(FN3)</a>? After the
  committee granted respondent an extension of time, he answered by denying all the charges against him.? Thereafter,
  the hearing committee conducted a formal hearing.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/1998-08-31_97-DB-072.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee submitted an extensive analysis of respondent's conduct concerning the
  Kingsland and Mitchell complaints.? The committee determined the record conclusively reveals that respondent
  commingled and converted funds held in trust for third parties.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As to the Kingsland transaction (Count I), the committee found respondent received $22,275.00.?
  He was entitled to withdraw a fee of $1,535.00 and to pay a realtor's commission of $1,260.00. <a href="#fn4"
  name="fnref4" id="fnref4">(FN4)</a>? Thus, between the date of receiving the check (August 16, 1996) and the date of
  paying off the mortgage (October 18, 1996), respondent should have maintained a balance of at least $19,480.00.?
  However, on a substantial number of days, respondent's balance was less than $19,480.00.? The committee determined
  the record conclusively reveals that respondent commingled and converted funds held in trust by him for third
  parties, resulting in a violation of Rule 1.15 of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">With regard to the Mitchell complaint (Count IV), the committee found the record contained a
  disbursement sheet executed on June 5, 1995, in which respondent had withheld $1,257.45 as fees owed to England Masse
  Chiropractic Clinic.? However, a subsequent disbursement sheet was allegedly executed four days later in which the
  amount shown as expenses payable to England Masse had been reduced to $628.72.? Although the committee did not know
  the reason for two different disbursement sheets, it determined that at the very least, respondent should have
  maintained $628.72 in his trust account between June 9, 1995 and February 10, 1997, the day on which the medical lien
  was satisfied.? However, respondent failed to maintain that balance, and the hearing committee found that on a
  substantial number of days the respondent's balance was below? $628.72. <a name="fnref5" href="#fn5"
  id="fnref5">(FN5)</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As to Counts II and V relating to the submission of falsified evidence, the committee found an
  analysis of the deposits, withdrawals, and balances the respondent submitted were irreconcilable with the records
  subpoenaed from the Hibernia Bank.? The hearing committee found a number of discrepancies, as outlined by the ODC in
  its brief.? The committee indicated that when the respondent was confronted with the discrepancies, he explained that
  "from time to time various bank balances do not coincide with each other .... you can review the bank's own records
  and it will show a monthly average balance from month to month which exceeds the amount owed to the health care
  provider.? I do not agree with the bank's calculations, thus I incorporated other procedures that assist me in
  maintaining a better accounting procedure."? The committee also noted that respondent had initially blamed the
  discrepancies on an accountant, "Terrence Nesbitt," whom the ODC's investigator was never able to locate, and who
  never appeared to testify on respondent's behalf.? In a separate letter, respondent then implied that the
  discrepancies should be blamed on his three secretaries, who have all "bought homes and new cars" since they had been
  working for him.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee rejected each of the explanations respondent offered to explain the discrepancies
  in the bank statements, noting that in other past disciplinary matters, respondent had attempted to place the blame
  on his office staff.? The committee indicated it had an opportunity to closely observe respondent's testimony and his
  demeanor, and it did not find his explanations to be believable.? The committee took note that the only person to
  gain from the alterations was Mr. Patrick and found that either he or someone at his direction altered the bank
  records in an attempt to prevent the ODC from detecting the commingling and conversion of funds.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">With regard to Count III, failing to honor a subpoena to appear and produce financial records,
  the committee determined there was no clear and convincing evidence indicating the respondent failed to cooperate,
  since he had mailed the records prior to the hearing date, and in the past that had been sufficient.? The hearing
  committee determined the allegations in Count III were without merit.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In sum, the committee determined by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent had
  violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.15</span>, <span class="Rules">3.3</span>, and <span class="Rules">3.4</span> of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct, as outlined in Counts I, II, IV, and V in the formal charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Referring to the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the Committee noted that under
  Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.11</span>, disbarment is appropriate for an attorney who fails to preserve a
  client's property and knowingly converts the property, causing injury or potential injury to a client.? Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">6.11</span> indicates that disbarment is appropriate when a lawyer submits false evidence
  with the intent to deceive the tribunal, makes a false statement, submits a false document, and causes significant or
  potentially significant adverse effects on the legal proceeding.? As such, the committee found the baseline sanction
  to be disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under Standard 9.22, the committee found the following aggravating factors:
  <span class="ABAstandard">prior discipline</span>, <a href="#fn6" name="fnref6" id="fnref6">(FN6)</a>
  <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the
  victims</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>.? The committee
  found no factors in mitigation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee indicated that with the exception of the attorney-client privilege, "there is no
  higher duty that an attorney owes to his client than to safeguard that property entrusted by the client to the
  attorney."? The committee conclusively established that respondent treated his client trust accounts as his own, and
  he submitted false evidence to cover up his wrongdoing and to obstruct the disciplinary process.? Finding
  respondent's conduct has caused "real harm to the respondent's clients, to the public and to the judicial system",
  the committee indicated the only proper remedy is disbarment and recommended that respondent be disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC did not object to the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee.? Respondent
  filed a motion for a continuance of the proceedings before the disciplinary board, which was denied.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/1999-03-18_97-DB-072.htm">Disciplinary Board Report</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board agreed with the findings of the hearing committee, finding the charges of
  commingling and conversion and of intentionally submitting altered records were proven by clear and convincing
  evidence.? The board found that respondent effectively treated his client trust account as his own and submitted
  false evidence in an attempt to cover up his wrongdoing and obstruct the disciplinary process.? Because his conduct
  has caused real harm to his clients, the public, the judicial system, and the profession, it? recommended that
  respondent be disbarred.? It further recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these
  proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of the court's judgment
  until paid.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed any objection in this court.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The record supports the findings of the hearing committee and disciplinary board.? Respondent
  clearly commingled and converted client funds, then submitted false evidence in an attempt to cover up his
  wrongdoing.? Such conduct demonstrates he has little regard for his client's welfare or his professional obligations
  as a member of the bar of this state.? Under these circumstances, we conclude disbarment is the appropriate
  sanction.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and the disciplinary
  board, and after consideration of the record filed herein, it is the decision of the court that the name of Robert E.
  Patrick be stricken from the roll of attorneys, and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be
  revoked.? Respondent is ordered to make restitution to his clients.? All costs and expenses of these proceedings are
  assessed against respondent, in accordance with <span>Supreme Court Rule XIX, s 10.1</span>, with legal interest to
  commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class='footnotetext'><a name="fn_" href="#fnref_" id="fn_">FN*</a> Marcus, J. not on panel.? Rule IV, Part II, s
  3.</p>

  <p class='footnotetext'><a name="fn1" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">FN1</a>. On March 24, 1999, this court placed
  respondent on interim suspension in 99-0410 (La.3/24/99), --- So.2d ----. The charges in the instant matter are
  unrelated to those mentioned in the interim suspension proceedings.</p>

  <p class='footnotetext'><a name="fn2" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">FN2</a>. The record includes bank statements from June,
  1995 through February, 1996.? In the Kingsland matter, records involving the same trust account from September and
  October of 1996 were also included, but those statements are not relevant to this specific charge.</p>

  <p class='footnotetext'><a name="fn3" href="../#fnref3" id="fn3">FN3</a>. Supreme Court Rule XIX, s 9(c) provides:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class='footnotetext'>It shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to:</p>

    <p class='footnotetext'>willfully violate a valid order of the court or the board imposing discipline, wilfully
    fail to appear before the board for admonition pursuant to Section 10(A)(5), or knowingly fail to respond to a
    lawful demand from a disciplinary authority, except that this rule does not require disclosure of information
    otherwise protected by applicable rules relating to confidentiality nor disclosure of information where the
    respondent urges a bona fide claim of privilege against testifying under the Constitution of the United States or
    of the State of Louisiana.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class='footnotetext'><a name="fn4" href="#fnref4" id="fn4">FN4</a>. Mrs. Kingsland steadfastly asserts in her
  correspondence included in the record that respondent was NOT entitled to subtract $1535 in attorney's fees, since
  all attorney's fees were to be payed by the buyer (who paid respondent $275 in fees for his handling of the
  transaction).? Mrs. Kingsland contends Mr. Patrick owes her an additional $1,666 from the sale of her property for
  the erroneously subtracted attorney's fees and for respondent's failure to resolve the property tax issues as Ms.
  Kingsland had directed.</p>

  <p class='footnotetext'><a name="fn5" href="#fnref5" id="fn5">FN5</a>. The committee noted that between August 11-14,
  1995, the account showed a negative balance of between -$150.14 and -$217.29.</p>

  <p class='footnotetext'><a name="fn6" href="#fnref6" id="fn6">FN6</a>. Respondent was admonished in 91-ADB-030 for
  violating Rules 1.15(a) and 5.3(a)(b)(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct for making personal child support
  payments with checks drawn on his client trust account.? In 95-B-1621, this court suspended the respondent for 90
  days, deferred, for misleading two clients.? In each of these disciplinary matters, respondent claimed he had no
  intention to commit wrongdoing, and he blamed the problems on his office staff.</p>

  <p class='footnotetext'>In 95-ADB-084, respondent was admonished for violating Rules 1.1(a), 1.4(b), and 1.5(c) of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct, for failing to properly handle tutorship proceedings, failing to advise his
  clients that all expenditures on behalf of the minor had to be approved by the court, and for collecting a
  contingency fee without a written contract.</p>
