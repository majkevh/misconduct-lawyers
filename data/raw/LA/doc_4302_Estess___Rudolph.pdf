<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA<br>
NO. 98-B-2741<br>
IN RE:&nbsp; RUDOLPH ESTESS, JR.</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>PER CURIAM</p>
<p><font size="3">*************************************************************************************<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This attorney disciplinary matter arises from a petition for consent disbarment filed by respondent, Rudolph Estess, Jr., an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana</font></p>
<p>.<b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After becoming aware of the facts, the ODC commenced an investigation.&nbsp; Prior to the institution of formal charges, respondent filed a</font> petition for consent discipline<font size="3"> and affidavit in support, wherein he acknowledged he violated </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15'></a><font size="3"> of the Rules of Professional Conduct through his commingling of personal funds into his client trust account.&nbsp; As a sanction, respondent proposed he be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year, with nine months deferred, followed by a two year period of supervised probation subject to conditions.</font><span class="CITE"><font size="1">1</font></span><p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ODC concurred in the petition for consent discipline.&nbsp; Relying on the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</font><font size="1">2</font><font size="3"> and considering the mitigating and aggravating factors,</font><font size="1">3</font><font size="3">&nbsp; the ODC concluded the requested discipline was appropriate.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pursuant to Supreme Court </font><font size="3">, Section 20, the tendered admission was submitted to the disciplinary board.</font></p>
<p><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A6346?an=JD_98-DB-041 --##'><b>Disciplinary Board Recommendation</b></a><b></b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After considering the facts, the disciplinary board recommended that the petition for consent discipline be approved by this court.&nbsp; However, in light of the petitioner's substance abuse and gambling problems, the board further recommended the additional probationary condition that respondent be assigned a monitor from the Lawyer's Assistance Program of the Louisiana State Bar Association.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither respondent nor the ODC have filed objections in this court to the board's recommendation.</font></p>
<p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Based upon our review of the record, we find the proposed consent discipline is appropriate under the facts.&nbsp; It is undisputed that respondent commingled personal funds with client funds in his client trust account.&nbsp; Although respondent did not convert any client funds to his personal use, there was potential that such conversion could have occurred, justifying some actual period of suspension.&nbsp; In addition to the suspension, the proposed probationary period and conditions, as modified by the disciplinary board, will serve to protect the public.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, we will accept the petition for consent discipline.</font></p>
<p><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A6346?an=JD_98-DB-041 --##'>disciplinary board</a>, the petition for consent discipline and the record filed herein, it is the decision of the court that the petition for consent discipline be accepted.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accordingly, it is ordered that respondent, Rudolph Estess, Jr., be </font>suspended<font size="3"> from the practice of law for a period of </font>one year, with nine months of this suspension deferred, followed by a two year period of probation with the conditions <font size="3">proposed by the disciplinary board.&nbsp; All proceeding costs are assessed against respondent with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the finality of the court's judgment until paid.</font></p>
<p class='footnotetitle'>FOOTNOTES:</p>
<p class='footnote'><font size="1">1</font><font size="3"> The conditions were as follows:<br>
</font>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(1) A probation monitor shall be appointed to periodically oversee respondent's </p>

</p>
<p class='footnote'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(2) Respondent shall properly maintain his client trust account;<br>

</p>
<p class='footnote'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(5) Respondent shall continue to be treated by his current clinical </p>

<p class='footnote'>Rules of Professional Conduct; and<br>
</p>
<p class='footnote'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(9) Respondent shall fully cooperate in any future disciplinary investigations.<br>
</p>
<p class='footnote'><font size="1">2</font><font size="3">&nbsp; ABA Standard 4.12 provides &quot;suspension is generally appropriate when a </font></p>
<p class='footnote'>lawyer knows or should know that he is dealing improperly with client property </p>
<p class='footnote'>and causes ... potential injury to a client.&quot;&nbsp; Standard 7.2 states suspension </p>
<p class='footnote'>is appropriate &quot;when a lawyer engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty </p>
<p class='footnote'>owed to the profession.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p class='footnote'><font size="1">3</font><font size="3">&nbsp; The ODC noted pattern of misconduct as the only aggravating factor.&nbsp; As to </font></p>
<p class='footnote'>mitigating factors, it recognized absence of selfish motive, personal and </p>
<p class='footnote'>emotional problems, cooperation with the ODC and remorse.</p>
<p><span class="BodyText4"><font size="3">CALOGERO, C.J., concurring.</font></span></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I concur in the action of the court, principally because this is respondent's own petition for Consent Discipline, which more or less tracks the Disciplinary Board's proposal, and because Disciplinary Counsel has not objected.&nbsp; I write separately, however, to state that I agree with the Board member who made the </font></p>
<p><font size="3">following expression in this case, in which the comingling of funds was only a technical violation:</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&quot;I see no actual misuse of the trust account.&nbsp; That Respondent's money is in &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;trust account does not seem illegal to me.&nbsp; I agree it's not good practice to leave it in trust for an unreasonable amount of time after clients' funds are &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;remitted.&nbsp; I don't see that Estess misused any client funds.&nbsp; I see no &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'enormous potential for injury' here.&nbsp; I disagree with the staff attorney's view of Lieberman.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case I don't second guess (1)admission of guilt or (2)1 year suspension with 9 months deferred.&nbsp; I do not believe conditions 3,4,5,6,8 or 9 [should be imposed]...&quot;</font></p>
