  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: MICHAEL S. FAWER</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 02-DB-073</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a petition for consent discipline by
  Michael S. Fawer ("Respondent") of Covington, Louisiana, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of
  Louisiana. For reasons stated below, the Disciplinary Board accepts the petition and orders that a public reprimand
  be issued against Respondent.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On July 24, 2002, Respondent filed a petition for consent discipline and an affidavit in support
  of consent discipline, wherein he admitted to violating Rule 8.4(d)<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct. Respondent proposes that as a result of this violation he be publicly reprimanded. On that same
  day, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") filed its concurrence in the petition.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On November 21, 2002, the matter came before a panel of the Disciplinary Board.</p>

  <h2>PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent provides the following information in the petition for consent discipline filed in
  this matter:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <h3>I.</h3>

    <p>[Respondent] is a Louisiana licensed attorney admitted to the practice of law in the State of Louisiana on the
    17th day of April, 1972, and with offices located at 301 North Columbia Street, Covington, Louisiana,
    70433-2917.</p>

    <h3>II.</h3>

    <p>The Office of Disciplinary Counsel has initiated a disciplinary investigation against the Respondent arising out
    of his comments and conduct as defense counsel in a criminal trial in the matter of United States v. Rene Ortlieb,
    III, and John Schulze, Docket No. 99-31-C-M3 of the United States District Court for the Middle District of
    Louisiana.</p>

    <h3>III.</h3>

    <p>As alleged by [ODC], during a six-week trial, the Respondent allegedly made inappropriate comments to the
    Assistant United States Attorney and to the Court resulting in five specifications of contempt.</p>

    <h3>IV.</h3>

    <p>The Respondent wishes to resolve this disciplinary investigation and therefore submits this Petition for Consent
    Discipline for a stated form of discipline, to wit: Public Reprimand.</p>

    <h3>V.</h3>

    <p>The Respondent specifically agrees that his conduct in the proceedings before Judge Tyson represent a violation
    of Rule <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span>, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and that
    the discipline agreed to hereinabove is appropriate.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>CONCURRENCE BY ODC</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">ODC provides the following additional information in its concurrence filed in this matter:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>* * *</p>

    <h3>3.</h3>

    <p>The Respondent's misconduct occurred during the course of a criminal proceeding [before] the Honorable Ralph
    Tyson, United States District Court Judge with the Middle District of Louisiana. The Respondent has been sanctioned
    by the United States District Court Judge and those monetary sanctions imposed have been affirmed by the Fifth U.S.
    Court of Appeal. <a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a></p>

    <h3>4.</h3>

    <p>[Chief Disciplinary Counsel] certifies that he has spoken directly to Judge Tyson who has advised that he does
    not intend to pursue nor seek further sanctions or discipline against [Respondent] as a result of his behavior in
    the above referenced criminal proceedings; that he has received a formal written letter of apology from the
    Respondent; and that he believes that a Public Reprimand issued by the Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board
    adequately and appropriately addresses the Respondent's misconduct.</p>

    <p>* * *</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rule
  <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The Board must accept that Respondent has
  violated this rule. <span class="CITE"><i>In re Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96); <a 
  href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given the violation of this rule, the Board is left
  to determine if the proposed sanction of public reprimand is appropriate.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="bodycopy"> whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system,
      or to the profession;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="bodycopy"> whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="bodycopy"> the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="bodycopy"> the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based upon a review of the documents, the Board finds that Respondent violated duties owed to the
  legal system and to the legal profession. The Board further finds that the legal system and the legal profession have
  been harmed by Respondent's actions. An attorney's failure to adhere to proper standards of conduct within the
  courtroom tarnishes the image of the legal profession and interferes with the orderly conduct of legal
  proceedings.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The record is bare of any evidence relating to Respondent's mental state. However, based upon the
  parties' assertions that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction, the Board concludes that Respondent's
  actions were negligent. <a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based upon the assertions contained in the stipulation of facts, ODC's concurrence, and
  Respondent's affidavit in support of the consent discipline, the Board finds that the following mitigating factors
  are present: <span class="ABAstandard">cooperative attitude toward these proceedings</span><a class="fn"
  href="#fn4">4</a> and <span class="ABAstandard">imposition of other penalties or sanctions</span>.<a class="fn"
  href="#fn5">5</a> The only aggravating factor apparent in this matter is Respondent's
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>. <a class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a></p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <h3>I. ABA Standards</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanction
  ("Standard") to determine the baseline sanction by determining "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's mental state
  and the extent of the injury caused; and then adjust[ing] the sanction in accordance with the aggravating and
  mitigating factors present." <span class="CITE"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94); <a 
  href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 350</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The proposed sanction is in line with the ABA guidelines. Under A.B.A. Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">7.3</span>, a "[r]eprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer negligently engages in
  conduct that is a violation of a duty owed to the profession, and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the
  public, or the legal system." The commentary to this standard states that:</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Reprimand is the appropriate sanction in most cases of a violation of a duty owed to the
  profession. Usually there is little or no injury to a client, the public, or the legal system, and the purposes of
  lawyer discipline will be best served by imposing a public sanction that helps educate the respondent lawyer and
  deter future violations. A public sanction also informs both the public and other members of the profession that this
  behavior is improper.</p>

  <h3>II. Relevant Case Law</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Board also looks to relevant case law for assistance in determining an appropriate sanction
  for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The cases of <span class="CITE"><i>In re Palmer</i>,
  <a  href="2000-11-20_99-DB-073.htm">99-DB-073</a> (Disc. Bd. Op. 11/20/2000)</span>; and
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re King</i>, <a  href="../SC/1992-06-05_1992-0441.htm">601 So. 2d 657</a> (La.
  1992)</span>, offer guidance here.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In the Palmer matter, supra, the Board accepted a petition for consent discipline and imposed a
  public reprimand for an attorney's violations of Rules 1.7<a class="fn" href="#fn7">7</a> and 8.4. There, Palmer was
  an heir in a litigious succession proceeding with family members. During the public sale of movables from the family
  home, he engaged in a physical confrontation with a family member. As a result, the district court found Palmer
  guilty of contempt for disregarding orders of the court and he was given a 30-day suspended sentence. <i>Id</i>. at
  p. 2.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In the case of <i>In re King, supra</i>, the Court imposed a public reprimand for an attorney's
  violations of Rules 8.4(d) and 3.5<a class="fn" href="#fn8">8</a>. In that case, King undertook representation of his
  sister and himself in a medical malpractice suite arising out of their mother's death. After a ruling adverse to
  their interests, King wrote a discourteous letter to the district judge and mailed it to the judge's residence. This
  resulted in a decision by the district judge finding King to be in constructive contempt of court and the issuance of
  a reprimand by the Supreme Court. <i>Id</i>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Although not involving a contempt of court charge, the case of <span class="CITE"><i>In re
  Estiverne</i>, 99-0949 (La. 9/24/99); <a  href="../SC/1999-09-24_1999-0949.htm">741 So. 2d
  649</a></span>, offers additional guidance. In that matter, the Court held that writing a discourteous and offensive
  letter to a worker's compensation judge, which attacked the judge's integrity, warranted a public reprimand.
  <i>Id</i>. at 653.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the petition for consent discipline be accepted, and
  that a public reprimand be issued against the respondent, Michael S. Fawer. It is further ordered that Respondent be
  assessed the costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the
  date of finality of this Ruling until paid.</p>
