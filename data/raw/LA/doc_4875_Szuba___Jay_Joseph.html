  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 04-B-1571</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: JAY J. SZUBA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from two sets of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Jay J. Szuba, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana, but
  currently ineligible to practice.</p>

  <h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Before we address the current charges, we find it helpful to review respondent's prior
  disciplinary and ineligibility history. Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in Louisiana in 1983. On
  August 5, 1996, respondent was admonished by the disciplinary board for failing to act with reasonable diligence and
  promptness, failing to communicate with a client, and failing to comply with a discovery request by an opposing
  party. On February 11, 1998, respondent was admonished a second time for failing to communicate with a client and
  failing to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 2001, we addressed a disciplinary proceeding against respondent for conduct that occurred
  between 1988 and 2000. The eleven counts of formal charges alleged that respondent failed to act with reasonable
  diligence and promptness, failed to communicate with clients, and failed to return client property at the termination
  of the representation. After a review of the record, we suspended respondent from the practice of law for two years.
  <span class="cite">In re: Szuba, 01-1877 (La. 10/5/01), <a href="2001-10-04_2001-1877.htm">797 So. 2d 41</a></span>
  (hereinafter referred to as "Szuba I").</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In addition to prior discipline, we note respondent has been declared ineligible to practice law
  on several occasions for failing to comply with his professional obligations, as follows: 9/4/98 to 2/4/99 for
  failure to pay bar dues and the disciplinary assessment; 9/3/99 to 7/17/00 for failure to pay bar dues and the
  disciplinary assessment; 9/4/01 to present for failure to pay bar dues and the disciplinary assessment; and 8/3/02 to
  present for failure to comply with the mandatory continuing legal education requirement.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed two sets of formal charges against respondent. The first set, bearing the
  disciplinary board's docket number 01-DB-096, was filed on September 17, 2001 and encompasses two counts of
  misconduct. The second set, bearing the disciplinary board's docket number 02-DB-106, was filed on October 16, 2002
  and encompasses one count of misconduct. The two sets of formal charges were considered by separate hearing
  committees, then consolidated by the disciplinary board. On June 23, 2004, the disciplinary board filed in this court
  a single recommendation of discipline encompassing both sets of formal charges.</p>

  <h3>01-DB-096</h3>

  <h4>Count I – The Blum Matter</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In April 1998, Dennis Blum paid respondent $1,000 to handle a property settlement matter.
  Respondent would not return Mr. Blum's phone calls or otherwise communicate with him regarding the matter. Therefore,
  Mr. Blum fired respondent. Even though he failed to complete the work he was retained to do, respondent did not
  refund the unearned portion of the fee. Mr. Blum's new attorney subsequently reviewed the court record and discovered
  a judgment had been entered that was favorable to Mr. Blum's ex-wife because respondent failed to appear in court on
  behalf of Mr. Blum.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In November 2000, Mr. Blum filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. Respondent failed
  to reply to the complaint, necessitating the issuance of a subpoena compelling him to appear on March 13, 2001 and
  answer the complaint under oath. On that day, respondent informed the ODC that he would respond to the complaint.
  When he nevertheless failed to do so, the ODC issued a second subpoena. In his sworn statement, respondent admitted
  that he failed to communicate with Mr. Blum. He claimed that he was traveling extensively during this time and was
  unable to sign for his certified mail or retrieve his voicemail messages before they were automatically deleted.
  Respondent also could not recall if he went to court on behalf of Mr. Blum and could not explain why he did not know
  about the final judgment in the case.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged respondent's conduct violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a
  client), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a client),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.5(f)</span> (failure to refund an unearned fee),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> (obligations upon termination of the representation),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation).</p>

  <h4>Count II – The McCormick Matter</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In March 1994, Robert McCormick retained attorney J. D. De Blieux to handle a civil matter. Mr.
  De Blieux turned the case over to respondent, who filed a petition for damages on behalf of Mr. McCormick. Respondent
  did not provide updates on the status of the case when requested by Mr. McCormick. Furthermore, respondent was
  personally served with several notices of court dates but failed to appear. Eventually, the case was dismissed
  because respondent failed to answer the defendant's discovery requests. However, respondent informed Mr. McCormick
  that the case was dismissed because the claim was not valid.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In January 2000, Mr. McCormick filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. Respondent
  failed to reply to the complaint, necessitating the issuance of a subpoena compelling him to appear and answer the
  complaint under oath. The ODC subsequently asked respondent to provide a supplemental response to the complaint. When
  he failed to do so, the ODC issued a second subpoena. In his sworn statements, respondent stated that Mr. De Blieux
  received all the mail regarding Mr. McCormick's case and did not notify him of the court dates. Respondent further
  informed the ODC that he did not claim his certified mail because he was out of town. He also did not remember being
  personally served with notices of court dates. The ODC alleged respondent's conduct violated the following Rules of
  Professional Conduct: Rules 1.3, 1.4, 8.1(c), 8.4(a), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct
  involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 8.4(d), and 8.4(g).</p>

  <h3>02-DB-106</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was declared ineligible to practice law as of September 4, 2001 because he failed to
  pay his bar dues and the disciplinary assessment. On October 8, 2001, respondent filed a Motion for Continuance and a
  memorandum in support on behalf of the plaintiffs in the civil matter entitled Mary K. Magyar, et al. v. State Farm
  Insurance Co., et al., No. 469,631 on the docket of the 19th Judicial District  Court for the Parish of East Baton
  Rouge. The next day respondent appeared in court to argue the motion before Judge Timothy Kelley. Even though the
  judge informed respondent that he was ineligible to practice law, respondent continued with the hearing.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On October 11, 2001, Judge Kelley filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. Respondent
  failed to reply to the complaint, necessitating the issuance of a subpoena compelling him to appear and answer the
  complaint under oath. At the sworn statement, respondent claimed he never received notice from the bar that he was
  ineligible to practice law. He further stated that he did not rectify his ineligible status because he was suspended
  soon after learning of his ineligibility from Judge Kelley.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged respondent's conduct violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">5.5(a)</span>
  (engaging in the unauthorized practice of law), 8.1(c), 8.4(a), and 8.4(g) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, as
  well as Supreme Court Rule XIX, §§ 8(D) (certifications of ineligibility to practice law for failure to pay the
  disciplinary assessment) and 8(E) (effect of certifications of ineligibility).</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was served with both sets of formal charges. He failed to answer or otherwise reply to
  the first set of formal charges; accordingly, the factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and
  proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). Respondent filed an answer to
  the second set of formal charges, denying any intentional wrongdoing.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1"
  id="fnref1">1</a></p>

  <h3>Hearing Committee Recommendations</h3>

  <h4>01-DB-096</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the deemed admitted facts, the hearing committee found that respondent "completely
  failed" to represent Mr. Blum, which led to an unfavorable judgment in Mr. Blum's case. Even though he admitted he
  had "dropped the ball," respondent did not offer to refund Mr. Blum's $1,000 fee. The committee also found that Mr.
  McCormick's case was dismissed because respondent failed to answer the defendant's discovery requests and noted the
  "complete lack of communication" between respondent and Mr. McCormick. Furthermore, respondent failed to cooperate
  with the ODC's investigation of both matters.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee determined that respondent caused harm to his clients. It also acknowledged
  respondent's history of neglecting client matters, as well as his ineligibility to practice law in 1998, 1999, and
  2000. Considering the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions and this court's prior jurisprudence dealing with
  similar misconduct, the committee determined the baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is a period of
  suspension.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In aggravation, the committee recognized respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">prior
  disciplinary offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">a pattern of misconduct</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>, and
  <span class="ABAstandard">indifference to making restitution</span>. The committee found no mitigating factors. Under
  these circumstances, the committee recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for three years
  and be ordered to make restitution to Mr. Blum in the amount of $1,000.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation in
  01-DB-096.</p>

  <h4>02-DB-106</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the evidence presented at the hearing and respondent's post-hearing memorandum, the
  hearing committee determined that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged in the formal
  charges. Respondent was ineligible to practice law when he filed a motion in the Magyar civil matter and when he
  argued the motion in front of Judge Kelley. When Judge Kelley informed respondent that he was ineligible to practice,
  respondent continued with the hearing. Respondent received notice of Judge Kelley's complaint but failed to respond,
  and the ODC had to subpoena him for a sworn statement. Furthermore, the committee found that respondent has not
  submitted a change of primary address to the Louisiana State Bar Association as required by Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
  8(C). Considering the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the committee determined the baseline sanction
  for respondent's misconduct is a suspension from the practice of law. As aggravating factors, the committee
  recognized respondent's prior disciplinary offenses, <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith obstruction of the
  disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the rules or orders of the disciplinary
  agency</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>. The committee
  found no mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these facts, the committee recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of
  law for a period of one year, to run consecutively to the suspension imposed in Szuba I.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation in
  02-DB-106.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-06-24_01-DB-096.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the consolidated matters,<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2"
  id="fnref2">2</a> the disciplinary board agreed that  respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as
  charged in the two sets of formal charges.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a> The board found
  that respondent violated duties owed to his clients,  the profession, and the legal system. His actions were knowing,
  and both Mr. Blum and Mr. McCormick were substantially injured by his conduct. Respondent actively represented Mr.
  Blum but failed to appear for trial, which led to the rendition of a judgment unfavorable to his client. Respondent
  rendered some legal services to Mr. Blum and advanced costs and expenses but failed to return the unearned portion of
  the fee when his services were terminated. Respondent failed to communicate with Mr. McCormick and caused the
  dismissal of his lawsuit by not responding to the defendant's discovery requests. Respondent also caused potential
  harm to the legal system when he filed a motion and argued that motion while he was ineligible to practice law.
  Furthermore, he harmed the disciplinary system by not cooperating with the ODC's investigations.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board found no mitigating factors, but acknowledged the following aggravating factors: prior
  disciplinary offenses, a pattern of misconduct, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally
  failing to comply with the rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, substantial experience in the practice of law,
  and indifference to making restitution.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board determined the baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is a lengthy suspension
  from the practice of law under the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions and the court's prior jurisprudence.
  However, the board observed that the bulk of the misconduct at issue occurred during the same time period as
  respondent's misconduct subject of Szuba I. Therefore, relying on <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v.
  Chatelain, <a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 So. 2d 470</a> (La. 1991)</span>, the board recommended that
  respondent be suspended from the practice of law for three years, to run concurrently with the suspension imposed in
  Szuba I. Furthermore, the board recommended that respondent be ordered to provide an accounting and restitution of
  unearned fees to Mr. Blum and that he be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings. One board member
  dissented and would recommend that respondent be disbarred. Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the
  disciplinary board's recommendation, but on our own motion, we ordered the parties to submit briefs addressing the
  issue of an appropriate sanction. The ODC filed a brief in response to the court's order. However, respondent failed
  to file a brief.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the ODC proved by clear and convincing
  evidence that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged in the formal charges. Respondent
  failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing both Mr. Blum and Mr. McCormick, failed to
  communicate with his clients, failed to refund the unearned portion of the legal fee Mr. Blum paid, engaged in
  conduct involving dishonesty and deceit by telling Mr. McCormick that his lawsuit was dismissed because the claim was
  not valid, and practiced law when he was ineligible to do so. Respondent also failed to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigations of the complaints filed against him. Having found evidence of professional misconduct, we now turn to
  a determination of the appropriate sanction for respondent's actions. In considering that issue, we are mindful that
  disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the
  integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis,
  <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's misconduct caused actual harm to his clients. Furthermore, his failure to cooperate
  with the ODC in its investigation impaired the efficient operation of the disciplinary process. No mitigating factors
  are supported by the record; however, several aggravating factors are present. Under these circumstances, we conclude
  the proper sanction is a suspension from the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain, <a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 So. 2d 470</a>
  (La. 1991), we observed that when the underlying conduct occurs within the same period as the misconduct forming the
  basis for a previous sanction, the discipline imposed should be determined as if both proceedings were before the
  court simultaneously. The instant case presents an interesting variation on the Chatelain theme, as the misconduct in
  the first set of formal charges occurred during the same time frame as the misconduct in Szuba I, but the
  unauthorized practice of law at issue in the second set of formal charges occurred thereafter. Accordingly, we must
  consider the two sets of formal charges separately.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The misconduct in the first set of formal charges, 01-DB-096, generally consists of a lack of
  diligence, failure to communicate, and failure to properly terminate the representation of clients. This misconduct
  is nearly identical to that seen in Szuba I, and it occurred during the same relevant time frame. Had the instant
  charges been considered simultaneously with those charges forming the basis of Szuba I, it would have only reinforced
  our view that a lengthy suspension was warranted to sanction respondent for his misconduct and to protect the public.
  Therefore, applying Chatelain, we will adjudge respondent guilty of additional violations which will be added to his
  record for consideration in the event he applies for reinstatement from Szuba I.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Turning to the second set of formal charges, 02-DB-106, the record clearly demonstrates that
  respondent practiced law after he was declared ineligible to do so,4 and despite having been warned of his
  ineligibility by a district judge. This misconduct did not take place at the same time as the misconduct that was at
  issue in Szuba I. Moreover, respondent did not cooperate with the ODC in its initial investigation of the complaint
  filed against him. Under the facts of this case, we find a one year and one day suspension is an appropriate sanction
  for respondent's misconduct subject of the second set of formal charges.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committees and the disciplinary
  board, and considering the record and the brief filed by the ODC, it is ordered that Jay J. Szuba, Louisiana Bar Roll
  number 2139, be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of one year and one day for the
  misconduct charged in 02-DB-106. As to 01-DB-096, it is ordered that respondent be adjudged guilty of additional
  violations which warrant discipline and which may be considered in the event he applies for reinstatement from his
  suspension in In re: Szuba, 01-1877 (La. 10/5/01), <a href="2001-10-04_2001-1877.htm">797 So. 2d 41</a>, after
  becoming eligible to do so. Respondent is ordered to furnish complete accountings and full restitution of all
  unearned legal fees to his clients subject of the formal charges. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed
  against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days
  from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> Respondent stated that he only
  practiced law once while ineligible. However, we note that during the period of his ineligibility, respondent also
  filed the petition for damages in the Magyar civil matter and requested that trial subpoenas be issued.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">2</a> We caution the board that we have
  previously disapproved its interpretation of the "deemed admitted rule," specifically a requirement in deemed
  admitted matters that the ODC "bears the burden of proving a prima facie case by competent evidence. . . ." See
  <span class="cite">In re: Donnan, 01-3058 (La. 1/10/03), <a href="2003-01-10_2001-3058.htm">838 So. 2d
  715</a></span>. Nevertheless, as the board found the formal charges against respondent were proven by clear and
  convincing evidence, we find the error is harmless in this case.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3" id="fn3">3</a> The board correctly found that Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, § 8(E) does not encompass a regulation that can be violated by an attorney. Rather, that section
  merely describes the effect of a certification of ineligibility.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4" class="fn" href="#fnref4" id="fn4">4</a> In these proceedings respondent has
  taken the cavalier position that such conduct does not warrant discipline. We disagree, having sanctioned attorneys
  on numerous occasions for practicing law while ineligible. See <span class="cite">In re: Hardy, 03-0443 (La. 5/2/03),
  <a href="2003-05-02_2003-0443.htm">848 So. 2d 511</a></span>, and the cases cited therein.</p>
