  <p class="Bodycopy">This matter arises from one count of formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, H. Gayle Marshall, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana but who is currently
  on interim suspension.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn" id="_ednref2">[i]</a></p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In March 1990, William H. Edmonds formed a corporation known as Alexandria Mobile Home Sales,
  Inc. ("AMH").  Although AMH's business principally involved the purchase and sale of mobile homes, the company would,
  from time to time, submit bids for government contracts to provide mobile homes in areas affected by natural
  disasters.  In September 1994, Edmonds and Doyle Luneau, Edmonds' business partner and a co-manager of AMH, submitted
  a bid on behalf of AMH to the United States Army Corp of Engineers.  The bid was in response to an invitation for
  bids to construct a mobile home park in Albany, Georgia for families displaced by severe flooding in that area. 
  AMH's bid was ultimately successful, and the contract awarded to the company by the Army Corp of Engineers was valued
  at more than $925,000.  However, during the course of the contract, Edmonds and Luneau converted to their own use
  more than $785,000 in progress payments that should have been paid to AMH's subcontractors and suppliers.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On November 7, 1994, Edmonds and Luneau met with respondent at his office in Lake
  Charles.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" class="fn" id="_ednref3">[ii]</a> The men told respondent about AMH's Army
  Corp of Engineers contract and thatthey had used the progress payments the company had already received for their own
  benefit.  Edmonds and Luneau sought respondent's advice as to how to best shield themselves and their property from
  the claims of legitimate creditors.  Respondent told Edmonds and Luneau that the matter could be taken care of for a
  fee.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On November 8, 1994, respondent again met with Edmonds and Luneau.  Respondent advised the men
  that he would prepare fictitious corporate minutes and resolutions and other documents reflecting non-existent loans
  by, and corporate obligations of, AMH in favor of Edmonds and Luneau.  Respondent intended that these documents would
  conceal Edmonds' and Luneau's actions in keeping the payments made to AMH under the Army Corp of Engineers contract. 
  At this meeting, Edmonds and Luneau paid respondent a fee of $22,500 to prepare the documents.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In a third meeting which took place on November 17, 1994, respondent presented Edmonds and Luneau
  with false and fictitious corporate minutes, resolutions, and other documents he had prepared, some of which were
  backdated to 1990.  Edmonds and Luneau signed the fabricated documents at respondent's direction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Later, when Edmonds was scheduled to be deposed in connection with a civil suit brought against
  AMH, respondent gave copies of the fabricated corporate documents to Edmonds and told him to study them and to
  testify consistently with them during the deposition.  Respondent was present at the February 1995 deposition, acting
  as the attorney for AMH and Edmonds.  When Luncau was deposed in April 1995 in connection with the same suit,
  respondent told Luneau to testify falsely under oath that he had made no decisions concerning the operation of AMH
  and that he had simply loaned money to the company and was attempting to get it back.  Respondent was also present at
  Luneau's deposition.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In June 1995, respondent delivered the falsified and backdated documents to a Special Agent in
  response to a federal grand jury subpoena, despite his knowledge that the records were material to the grand jury's
  investigation of the matter involving AMH's Army Corps of Engineers contract.  Moreover, respondent provided
  untruthful testimony when he personally appeared before the grand jury.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" class="fn"
  id="_ednref4">[iii]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On July 11, 1997, the United States Grand Jury sitting in the Southern District of Georgia,
  Savannah Division, returned a four count indictment against respondent.  On October 10, 1997, respondent pleaded
  guilty to counts two (obstruction of justice) and three (making false declarations before a grand jury) of the
  indictment.  Respondent was subsequently fined and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of thirteen months as to each
  count, to be served concurrently, to be followed by a two-year period of supervised release and 500 hours of
  community service.</p>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On October 10, 1997, following his guilty plea in the United States District Court, Southern
  District of Georgia, Savannah Division, respondent was convicted of one count of obstruction of the due
  administration of justice, a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1503, and one count of false declarations before a grand jury,
  a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623.  The ODC alleges that respondent's conduct violates Rules
  <span class="Rules">3.3</span><span class="Rules">(a)(2)</span> (concealing or knowingly failing to disclose that
  which the lawyer is required by law to reveal), <span class="Rules">3.3</span><span class="Rules">(a)(4)</span>
  (offering evidence the lawyer knows to be false), <span class="Rules">3.4</span><span class="Rules">(a)</span>
  (unlawfully altering, destroying, or concealing evidence),
  <span class="Rules">3.4</span><span class="Rules">(b)</span> (falsifying evidence and counseling or assisting a
  witness to testify falsely), <span class="Rules">8.4</span><span class="Rules">(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct), <span class="Rules">8.4</span><span class="Rules">(b)</span> (commission of a criminal act
  reflecting adversely on the lawyer honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer),
  <span class="Rules">8.4</span><span class="Rules">(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,
  deceit, or misrepresentation), and <span class="Rules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 19(B)</span> (conviction of a
  "serious crime" reflecting upon the attorney's moral fitness to practice law).</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After the ODC instituted formal charges, respondent, through counsel, filed an answer admitting
  the factual allegations of the formal charges and seeking the imposition of appropriate sanctions.  When the matter
  was presented for formal hearing before a hearing committee, the sole issue to be determined was the appropriate
  sanction for respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/1999-03-11_98-DB-006.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the indictment, respondent's guilty plea, and the transcript of the sentencing
  hearing, the committee concluded that respondent violated the professional rules as charged.  With respect to the
  imposition of discipline for respondent's misconduct, the committee found the baseline sanction is disbarment,
  considering that respondent's crime involved the intentional interference with the administration of justice, false
  swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, and the attempt to assist others in the misappropriation of property.  The
  committee found three mitigating factors, namely the absence of a prior disciplinary record, good character and
  reputation, and remorse, and three aggravating factors, including dishonest or selfish motive, substantial experience
  in the practice of law (admitted 1972), and illegal conduct.  After consideration of the <i>ABA's Standards for
  Imposing Lawyer Sanctions and prior jurisprudence, <sup><a href="#_edn4">4</a></sup></i> the committee concluded
  there was no reason to deviate form the baseline sanction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the situation before this committee it is undisputed that false evidence was prepared by the
  Respondent with the intent to deceive.  It is equally, clear that the actions of the Respondent resulted in a
  significantly, adverse impact on the orderly administration of justice.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, the hearing committee recommended that respondent be disbarred from the practice of
  law.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/1999-10-29_98-DB-006.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board agreed with the hearing committee that respondent violated duties owed to the legal
  system, the profession, and the public.  The board found that by making false and misleading declarations to a
  tribunal and by obstructing justice, respondent engaged in knowing and intentional misconduct.  The board also noted
  that there is sufficient authority to support disbarment<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" class="fn"
  id="_ednref5">[iv]</a> for respondent's criminal conviction, citing <span class="CITE"><i>In re: </i> Sentenn,</span>
  98-3019 (La. 1/29/99), <a href="1999-01-29_1998-3019.htm">730 So. 2d 868</a>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: </i>
  Basile,</span> 98-0900 (La. 5/29/98), <a href="1998-05-29_1998-0900.htm">714 So. 2d 687</a>; <span class="CITE"><i>In

  38</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, the board recommended that respondent be disbarred from the practice of law.  The
  board further recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal
  interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of the court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on our review of the record, we find that the ODC proved by clear and convincing evidence
  that respondent knowingly and intentionally participated in criminal conduct that involved misrepresentation and
  fraud. His actions demonstrate he lacks the fitness to practice law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board's recommendation and disbar respondent from
  the practice of law in Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the
  record, it is ordered that the name of H. Gayle Marshall be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license
  to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.  All costs
  and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with
  legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  he "knowingly lied to the grand jury when I denied having told Luneau and Edmonds that I would testify that I had
  started representing Alexandria Mobile Homes, Inc. in 1990.... I didn't want the grand jury to [k]now that I had told
  Luneau and Edmonds that I would lie if subpoenaed.  I was afraid of making such an admission because I knew that it
