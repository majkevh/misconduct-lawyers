  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM. <a name="fnref_" class="fn" href="#fn_" id="fnref_">FN*</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from the filing of one count of formal charges by
  the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Kevin David Thompson, an attorney licensed to practice
  law in the State of Louisiana, for allowing his client's claim to prescribe and becoming involved in a conflict of
  interest by attempting to monetarily settle his liability with his client, in violation of Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (lack of due diligence);? Rule <span class="Rules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate
  with a client);? <span class="Rules">1.8(a)</span>(entering into business transactions with a client);?
  <span class="Rules">1.8(c)</span>(providing financial assistance to a client);?
  <span class="Rules">1.8(h)</span>(making an agreement limiting the lawyer's liability for malpractice);?
  <span class="Rules">1.16(a)</span>(declining or terminating representation);?
  <span class="Rules">8.3(a)</span>(failure to report malpractice);? <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span>(violation of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct);? and <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span>(engaging in conduct involving dishonesty,
  fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The record indicates that respondent was retained by Carmen Lynn Scott to pursue a worker's
  compensation claim on her behalf.? Respondent failed to timely pursue the claim and believed it had prescribed.?
  Since respondent did not at the time have professional liability insurance, he made a "personal agreement" with Ms.
  Scott to advance funds up to $7,500.00 to her.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">FN1</a>? After he
  made about twenty-five cash advances, aggregating to approximately $5,000.00 over a two year period, respondent had
  his client execute a "distribution statement" drafted in the language of a tort claim? receipt and release agreement.
  <a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">FN2</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">? ? ?Ms. Scott filed a complaint with the ODC.? While the respondent admitted in his answer that
  he let the claim prescribe, he stated he advised his client of his failure to timely file her claim and agreed to pay
  her restitution in monthly installments pursuant to their agreement.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">??? ?Thereafter, the ODC filed formal charges, and a hearing was conducted before the committee.?
  The parties stipulated to the mitigating factors present:? <span class="ABAstandard">no prior disciplinary
  record</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">free disclosure with the ODC</span> and
  <span class="ABAstandard">inexperience in the practice of law</span>. <a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#FN3"
  id="fnref3">FN3</a> As factors in aggravation, the board argued <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest and selfish
  motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct</span>, and
  <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the victim</span>.? Respondent testified on his own behalf and had a
  witness testify regarding his good reputation in the community.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On September 4, 1997, <span class="CITE"><a href="../HC/1997-09-04_97-DB-029.htm">the hearing
  committee</a></span> filed its recommendation with the disciplinary board, proposing respondent be? suspended from
  the practice of law for seventy-five days, with reinstatement conditioned on supervised probation for a period of
  eighteen months, as well as completion of mandatory continuing legal education primarily in the area of ethics.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On January 9, 1998, <span class="CITE"><a href="../DB/1998-01-09_97-DB-029.htm">the disciplinary
  board</a></span> issued its recommendation to this court. The board determined the evidence showed respondent
  permitted his client's case to prescribe and later became involved in a conflict of interest when he tried to settle
  his liability without advising his client to seek independent legal advice.? The board recommended respondent be
  suspended from practice for a period of one year, with such suspension totally deferred, and placed on an eighteen
  month probationary period under the guidance of a practice monitor.? It also recommended that respondent take two
  additional hours of continuing legal education in the area of ethics annually for all years or partial years he is on
  probation, as well as be assessed? with costs.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On February 2, 1998, respondent filed an objection in this court to the disciplinary board's
  proposed sanction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the hearing committee and disciplinary board findings and recommendations, and
  considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is the decision of this court that the recommendation of the
  disciplinary board be adopted.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, it is ordered respondent, Kevin David Thompson, be suspended from the practice of
  law for a period of one year, deferred, subject to an eighteen month period of supervised probation under the
  conditions set forth in the disciplinary board's recommendation.? All costs in this matter are assessed against
  respondent.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn_" class="fn" href="#fnref_" id="fn_">FN*</a>? Victory, J. not on panel.? Rule IV,
  Part 2, s 3.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="../#fnref1" id="fn1">FN1.</a> The record is conflicting as to
  whether Ms. Scott was made aware of the malpractice by the respondent when they entered into their agreement.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">FN2</a>. Respondent testified he only paid
  $5,000 because he valued Ms. Scott's claim at $7,500.00 and then deducted his 1/3 contingency fee.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="FN3" class="fn" href="#fnref3" id="FN3">FN3</a>. Respondent was practicing law for
  one and one-half years at the time of his misconduct.</p>
  <hr />

  <div id="dissentLemmon">
    <p><span class="BodyText4">LEMMON, Justice, dissenting</span></p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">After allowing his client's claim to prescribe, respondent told his client that her "claim had
    passed and it was my fault that it had passed."?? He proposed to make restitution to the client on a periodic
    payment basis for the value, as estimated by respondent, of the client's claim.? Respondent should have, but did
    not, advise the client that she (the client) might consult another attorney to evaluate the claim.
    <a name="disfnref1" class="fn" href="#disfn1" id="disfnref1">FN1</a>? Plaintiff then proceeded to pay the amount of
    $5,000 over two years.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's failure to advise the client that she might seek an independent evaluation of the
    claim was mitigated by his inexperience in the practice of law and his free disclosure to disciplinary counsel and
    cooperation in the disciplinary proceeding.? Moreover, the generous evaluation of the claim for purposes of
    restitution militates against findings by the hearing committee and disciplinary board of dishonest and selfish
    motive, vulnerability of the victim, and refusal to acknowledge wrongful conduct as aggravating circumstances.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, a public reprimand, combined with a twelve-month period of
    supervised probation, is an adequate penalty for the misconduct proved in this case.</p>
    <hr />

    <p class="footnotetext"><a name="disfn1" class="fn" href="#disfnref1" id="disfn1">FN1</a>. Indeed, as indicated by
    the attorney for the employer, the value of the claim estimated by the respondent for restitution purposes was very
    generous.</p>
