<p><font size="3"><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The record indicates that in July 1996, Paula Paddie retained the respondent to file a divorce on her behalf and obtain alimony pendente lite.&nbsp; Ms. Paddie paid respondent a fee of $550 and instructed him to file the petition immediately.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, respondent failed to file the petition, instead deceiving his client into believing that it had been filed.1&nbsp; Respondent failed to communicate with his client and failed to return the unearned legal fee, despite his client's many requests, until September, 1997.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</b></font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After Ms. Paddie filed her complaint, the ODC took respondent's deposition.&nbsp; Respondent indicated he initially questioned Ms. Paddie's decision to seek alimony pendente lite, finding some of the items she listed in her expense affidavit to be questionable.&nbsp; Respondent admitted that he had not filed the divorce suit on Ms. Paddie's behalf, but &quot;left her believing that it had been filed.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Ms. Paddie learned of respondent's failure to file the divorce, respondent asserted he returned the fee and court costs.&nbsp; He also stated he entered into negotiations with Ms. Paddie's new attorney in an attempt to compensate her for the loss of alimony pendente lite.</font><span class="CITE">2</span></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On December 4, 1997, the ODC instituted formal charges against respondent.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Respondent failed to file an answer.&nbsp; As a result, the matter was considered on documentary evidence alone.</font><span class="CITE">3</span></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On March 12, 1998, the hearing committee filed its report with the disciplinary board, recommending respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year, as well as assessed with all costs.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On July 30, 1998, the disciplinary board issued its recommendation to the court.&nbsp; Relying on Standards 4.41, 4.6 and 7.2 of the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions,</font><span class="CITE">4 </span> and the presence of several aggravating factors,<span class="CITE">5&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the board recommended respondent be suspended from the practice of law a period of one year and one day.&nbsp; In support of this slightly increased sanction, the board noted the element of deceit mandated that respondent be required to file an application for reinstatement<span class="CITE">.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One board member concurred, but felt respondent's failure to cooperate may have justified a greater sanction.</p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the recommendation of the disciplinary board.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondent's deposition testimony establishes that he failed to file the divorce petition on behalf of his client, and then attempted to deceive her into believing the petition had been filed.&nbsp; Respondent failed to communicate with his client, and failed to refund the unearned fee until over one year later.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Given these facts, combined with respondent's prior disciplinary record, we conclude the board's recommendation of a suspension from the practice of law for a period of one year and one day is appropriate and consistent with the prior decisions of this court.</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="1">8</font></p>
<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DECREE</b></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the findings and recommendations of th</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b>e<a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Aa94b?an=JD_HC9768 --##'> hearing committee</a></b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> and <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A65bd?an=JD_97-db-081 --##'>disciplinary board</a>, and considering the record filed herein, it is the decision of this court that the disciplinary board's recommendation be adopted.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accordingly, it is ordered that respondent, Barry G. Feazel, be </font>suspended<font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> from the practice of law for a period of </font>one year and one day.<font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; All costs of these proceedings are assessed against respondent.<br>
</font></p>
<p class='footnotetitle'>FOOTNOTES:</p>
<p class='footnote'>1&nbsp; Ultimately, Ms. Paddie's husband filed and obtained the divorce in November of 1996.&nbsp; As a result, Ms. Paddie was deprived of her opportunity to receive alimony pendente lite.<br>
</p>
<p class='footnote'>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The record indicates Ms. Paddie filed a malpractice claim against respondent in civil court.&nbsp; The case was ultimately settled for $3,300 plus court costs, representing an estimate of the alimony she would have received had respondent filed the divorce action when he was first retained to do so.</p>
<p class='footnote'>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ODC submitted into evidence a copy of the complaint, notices to the respondent, respondent's deposition, a letter from Ms. Paddie's new attorney, a copy of a legal malpractice suit instituted against respondent and evidence of </p>
<p class='footnote'>respondent's prior discipline.</p>
<p class='footnote'>4&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard 4.41 of the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions provides &quot;[d]isbarment is generally appropriate when a lawyer abandons the practice and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client, and knowingly fails </p>
<p class='footnote'>to perform services for a client and causes serious injury or potential injury.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard 4.6 provides &quot;suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly deceives a client.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard 7.2 states &quot;suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates a duty owed to the profession and injures the legal system or a client.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p class='footnote'>5&nbsp; While it failed to find any mitigating factors, the board recognized as several aggravating factors:&nbsp; (1) prior discipline (respondent was reprimanded in 1986 for charging a clearly excessive fee in a wrongful death case and in 1987 for commingling funds from operating and trust accounts);&nbsp; (2) dishonest or selfish motive;&nbsp; (3) obstruction of disciplinary system;&nbsp; and (4) </p>
<p class='footnote'>vulnerability of the victim.</p>
<p class='footnote'>6&nbsp; Supreme Court Rule XIX, s 24(A) requires that an attorney suspended for more than one year must file an application for reinstatement.<br>
</p>
<p class='footnote'>7&nbsp; See In re:&nbsp; Kendrick, 98-0623 (La.4/3/98), 710 So.2d 236 (attorney, with a prior disciplinary record, was suspended for one year and one day for legal neglect, failing to communicate with a client, failing to return or account for </p>
<p class='footnote'>an unearned fee and failing to cooperate with the ODC);&nbsp; In re:&nbsp; Williams, 98-0773 (La.4/24/98), 709 So.2d 211 (attorney was suspended for one year and one day followed by a two year period of probation for neglecting a legal matter, failing to communicate with his client, and failing to safeguard and commingling of client funds).</p>
