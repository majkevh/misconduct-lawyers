  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 01-DB-063</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a Petition for Consent Discipline
  (herein "Petition") by the respondent, Nanak Singh Rai (herein "Respondent"), of Metairie, Louisiana, after the
  filing of formal charges.  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (herein "ODC") has concurred in Respondent's Petition. 
  After reviewing the record and considering the law, the Board accepts the Petition and orders a public reprimand be
  issued against the Respondent in addition to six months of supervised probation and other conditions as set forth
  herein.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On June 25, 2001, ODC filed formal charges consisting of one complaint alleging Respondent failed
  to communicate, charged an excessive fee and failed to disclose a potential conflict of interest.  On August 18,
  2001, Respondent denied the substantive allegations and a hearing was scheduled for October 22, 2001.  On October 12,
  2001, Respondent retained counsel and moved to continue the hearing date.  The hearing was continued to February 15,
  2002, but was stayed pending the resolution of Respondent's Application for Writs of Certiorari or Review or for
  Supervisory or Remedial Writs regarding ODC's request to conduct a telephonic deposition.  On April 12, 2002, the
  Court denied Respondent's application and the hearing was scheduled for July 25, 2002.  On May 29, 2002, Respondent
  filed his First Amended Answer and admitted only that Respondent's father, Dr. Gurbachan S. Rai provided complainant,
  T.C. Mohammed,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" class="fn" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> with interpretation and
  transportation services and that complainant executed a power of attorney appointing Dr. Rai as his
  attorney-in-fact.  On July 15, 2002, Respondent filed his pre-hearing memorandum.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On July 18, 2002, Respondent filed a Petition for Consent Discipline and Stipulation of Facts
  seeking a public reprimand, six months of probation and other conditions.  On July 18, 2002, ODC concurred.  A Board
  panel reviewed the matter on November 21, 2002.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" class="fn" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></h2>

  <blockquote>
    <div id="fc01-DB-063">
      <h3>COUNT I</h3>

      <p>In 1997, Mr. T.C. Mohammad was working as a welder for Industrial Marine and Industrial Inc., when he was
      injured.  Mr. Mohammad is a foreign worker from India working under an H2B visa. Mr. Mohammed is currently living
      in India. Before leaving America, Mr. Mohammed hired Mr. Rai to handle the case, and provided Mr. Rai with a
      Power of Attorney so that he could continue working on it. Mr. Mohammad believed the Power of Attorney was for
      Mr. Rai, but has subsequently found out that the Power of Attorney was executed in favor of the Respondent's
      father, Dr. G.S. Rai. Mr. Rai sent Mr. Mohammed a certified letter in May of 1999, providing a check and
      settlement documents.  In response, Mr. Mohammed sent Mr. Rai a letter asking for further explanation and a
      breakdown of costs. Mr. Rai failed to respond and several months later a complaint was filed with the Office of
      Disciplinary Counsel. Mr. Rai's failure to adequately communicate with his client was in violation of Rule
      <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" class="fn" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> of the
      Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

      <p>An accounting from Mr. Rai, provided after Mr. Mohammed filed a complaint with the Office of Disciplinary
      Counsel, includes interpreter costs, as well as transportation costs. Mr. Rai hired his own father to act as an
      interpreter and provide transportation. Mr. Rai's father speaks Urdu and Hindustani dialects spoken in Pakistan.
      Mr. Mohammed has indicated that he speaks a different dialect, Malayalam. Mr. Mohammed has given a statement
      through his lawyer, that he has a limited understanding of English, but understands more than he can speak. Mr.
      Mohammad says he did not approve hiring Dr. G.S. Rai or discuss any fees related to hiring him.</p>

      <p>Though it has not been submitted or approved by the Worker's Compensation Court, Mr. Rai calculated that Mr.
      Mohammad owes $7,720 (Seven-thousand seven hundred twenty dollars) in statutory attorney's fees and $12,500.00
      (Twelve-thousand five hundred dollars) to his father for interpreter costs. The interpreter costs Mr. Rai is
      trying to collect is almost $5,000.00 (Five-thousand dollars) more than the attorney's fees he is trying to
      collect. The contract signed lists expenses, but does not include costs for an interpreter, or transportation.
      Mr. Rai has attempted to obtain more than the statutory fee allowed in Workman's Compensation cases by seeking
      unapproved costs by either Mr. Mohammad or the Workman's Compensation Judge. Mr. Rai's attempt to collect excess
      money as well as the hiring of his father and inclusion of him in the Power of Attorney violated Rules of
      Professional Conduct <span class="allegedrules">1.5</span>,<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" class="fn"
      id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> <span class="allegedrules">1.8</span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" class="fn"
      id="_ftnref5">[5]</a> and <span class="allegedrules">8.4</span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" class="fn"
      id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>.</p>

      <p>Mr. Rai should have timely provided an accounting upon the request of his client. Mr. Rai failed to notify his
      client of the possible conflicts he had in handling the case. Mr. Rai failed to disclose to his client orally, or
      in the contract that he was going to hire his father, or charge interpreter or transportation costs. Mr. Rai
      failed to sufficiently communicate with Mr. Mohammad about the Power of Attorney, and that his father had the
      authority to act on his behalf. Mr. Rai's conduct in this case violated Rules 1.4, 1.5, 1.8, and 8.4 of the Rules
      of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2>STIPULATION OF FACTS<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" class="fn" id="_ftnref7"><b>[7]</b></a></h2>

  <blockquote>
    <div id="fc01-DB-063st">
      <h3>I.</h3>

      <p>Nanak Singh Rai was admitted to practice law on April 11 1994.</p>

      <h3>II.</h3>

      <p>Mr. Rai has no prior attorney discipline and is currently eligible to practice law in the State of
      Louisiana.</p>

      <h3>III.</h3>

      <p>The Office of Disciplinary Counsel received a complaint from Mr. T.C. Mohammed about the way Mr. Rai handled
      his Worker's Compensation case. Mr. Mohammed was working as a welder for Industrial Marine and/or TMS, Inc.,
      d/b/a Staff U.S.A., when he was injured in November of 1997. Mr. Mohammad is a foreign worker from India working
      under an H2B visa. Mr. Mohammed is currently living in India. He retained Mr. Rai to represent him on December
      15, 1997. Mr. Mohammad returned to India because of his father's illness, and before leaving he executed a power
      of attorney, so that Mr. Rai could continue to work on the case.</p>

      <h3>IV.</h3>

      <p>In conjunction with the representation, Mr. Rai was able to obtain indemnity benefits and medical treatments
      for his client. Mr. Rai and Mr. Mohammad disagree as to whether services were arranged or done to provide
      transportation and interpreter service. Clearly the contract signed by the parties does not provide for these
      services or expenses.</p>

      <h3>V.</h3>

      <p>Mr. Rai sent Mr. Mohammed a certified letter in May of 1999 providing a check and settlement documents. In
      response, Mr. Mohammed sent Mr. Rai a letter asking for further explanation and a breakdown of costs. Mr. Rai
      failed to respond before a complaint was filed with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.</p>

      <h3>VI.</h3>

      <p>An accounting from Mr. Rai provided after Mr. Mohammed filed a complaint with the Office of Disciplinary
      Counsel included interpreter costs, as well as transportation costs charged for services provided by Dr. G.S.
      Rai. According to Mr. Rai, Mr. Mohammad hired his father, Dr. G.S. Rai to act as an interpreter and to transport
      Mr. Mohammad. Dr. Rai speaks Urdu and Hindustani dialects spoken in Pakistan. Mr. Rai calculated that Mr.
      Mohammad owed his father $12,500.00 for interpreter costs at $125.00 per hour for a hundred hours. The contract
      signed addresses costs, but does not specifically mention expenses for an interpreter, or transportation. Mr.
      Mohammed has indicated that he has a limited understanding of English understanding more than he can speak, and
      that he did not approve of this arraignment or expenditure. Mr. Mohammed has indicated that he speaks a different
      dialect Malayalam.</p>

      <p>The matter was recently litigated and the Worker's Compensation Judge awarded $2500.00 (Twenty-Five Hundred
      Dollars) for interpreter expenses, but did not approve transportation costs. Mr. Rai should have diligently
      communicated with his client, and promptly accounted for funds. Mr. Rai should have disclosed and included in his
      contract any additional expenses for an interpreter or transportation, as well as disclose any potential conflict
      of interest. Mr. Rai's conduct in this case violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span>,<a href="#_ftn8"
      name="_ftnref8" class="fn" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a> <span class="Rules">1.4</span>,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"
      class="fn" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a> and <span class="Rules">1.15(B)</span><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"
      class="fn" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a>.</p>

      <h3>VII.</h3>

      <p>In mitigation Mr. Rai would submit that he has no prior disciplinary history and had been practicing a short
      time before these events took place. Furthermore, Mr. Rai is willing to take steps as outlined in proposed
      Consent Discipline to make the client whole and improve his practice.</p>
    </div>

  <h2>RESPONDENT'S REQUEST FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE AND ODC'S CONCURRENCE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon the Stipulation of Facts, Respondent admits that his conduct violated duties owed to
  his client, Mr. Mohammed.  Respondent agrees that his conduct violated Rules 1.3, 1.4 and 1.15(b).<a href="#_ftn11"
  name="_ftnref11" class="fn" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a>Respondent admits his misconduct in exchange for:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1.  Public reprimand.</p>

    <p class="inverted">2.  Six (6) months probation.</p>

    <p class="inverted">3.  The Respondent agrees he will not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct while on
    probation.</p>

    <p class="inverted">4.  Respondent will respond to all reasonable requests of his probation monitor.</p>

    <p class="inverted">5.  Respondent will promptly return to the client any funds with interest from his trust
    account not granted by the Worker's Compensation Judge in the case.</p>

    <p class="inverted">6.  Respondent will modify his contract of employment in Worker's Compensation cases to address
    the issue of potential expenses, including transportation and interpreter costs, and include a provision that those
    costs will be reviewed by the Worker's Compensation Judge handling the case.</p>

    <p class="inverted">7.  Respondent shall enroll in and attend one (1) full day of Ethics School administered by the
    Louisiana State Bar Association's Practice Assistance and Improvement Committee.</p>

    <p class="inverted">8.  Respondent shall review his calendaring system and method to communicate with clients with
    his probation monitor.</p>

    <p class="inverted">9.  Respondent shall maintain current in the law during his period of probation by satisfying
    all annual MCLE requirements of the Louisiana State Bar Association in a timely fashion, pay all Louisiana State
    Bar Association bar dues, and pay all Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board disciplinary assessments imposed by the
    Louisiana Supreme Court.</p>

    <p class="inverted">10.  Respondent agrees that any violation of any terms or conditions set forth shall result in
    a summary revocation of probation and a hearing to determine the appropriate sanction to be imposed.</p>

    <p class="inverted">11.  The Respondent is responsible for all normal costs of the disciplinary process and
    consent  proceedings, consistent with Rule XIX Section 10.1.</p>

    <p>R.'s P. Cons. Disc. (7/18/02).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC concurred with the consent discipline.  In support of a public reprimand with conditions, ODC
  relied upon <span class="CITE"><i>In re Dennis S. Mann</i>, <a href="1999-03-08_98-DB-091.htm">98-DB-091</a></span>;
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Dennis K. Dolbear</i>, <a href="1999-02-24_98-DB-061.htm">98-DB-061</a></span>;
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re C. Kenneth Deshotel</i>, <a href="1999-04-08_97-DB-063.htm">97-DB-063</a></span> and
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Arden Wells</i>, <a href="1999-04-13_98-DB-071.htm">98-DB-071</a></span>.  In mitigation,
  ODC urged the recognition of no prior discipline, cooperation with the disciplinary process, restitution to the
  client, inexperience in the practice of law at the time giving rise to the complaint<a href="#_ftn12"
  name="_ftnref12" class="fn" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a> and safeguarding the disputed funds in his trust account until
  the matter was resolved.  ODC did not pursue the violation of Rules 1.5, 1.8 and 8.4, as charged, and instead, has
  agreed to a violation of Rules 1.3, 1.4 and 1.15(b).</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED SANCTION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Respondent and ODC have conditionally agreed that Respondent has violated Rules 1.3, 1.4 and
  1.15(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  The Board accepts that Respondent has violated these rules. 
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96); <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So.2d
  272</a></span>.  Given the conditionally tendered violations, the Board must determine if the proposed sanction is
  appropriate.  The Board is required to analyze the facts of the consent discipline to determine if the proposed
  sanction is appropriate for the stated misconduct.  La. Sp. Ct. R. XIX, &sect;20.  The Board must either accept or reject
  the proposed consent discipline.  In making the Board's findings, the Louisiana Supreme Court requires the Board to
  consider whether the proposed discipline is appropriate based upon the following criteria:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>

    <p class="inverted">La. Sp. Ct. R. XIX, &sect;10(C).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent has negligently violated duties owed to his client, Mr. Mohammed.  His client was
  harmed by the delay in receiving his full worker's compensation award, the inconvenience to pursue this matter
  (exacerbated by Mr. Mohammed's return to his native country of India) and having to engage other legal counsel to
  assist him with pursuing this complaint.  However, Mr. Mohammed has received full restitution at the judicial rate of
  interest and there is no evidence that his rights and/or case were prejudiced by Respondent's conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> (herein "Standard") section
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span> provides for a public reprimand when "a lawyer is negligent and does not act
  with reasonable diligence in representing a client, and causes injury or potential injury to a client."  Respondent 
  failed to address Mr. Mohammed's questions about the breakdown of costs relative to his worker's compensation claim
  and failed to communicate or reach an understanding about interpreter and transportation costs.  Respondent asserted
  that Mr. Mohammed owed Dr. G.S. Rai, Respondent's father, $12,500 for interpreter and transportation services.  The
  Worker's Compensation judge awarded Respondent $2,500 for interpreter costs and nothing for transportation.  The
  baseline sanction is a public reprimand.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the case of <span class="CITE"><i>In re Mouton</i>, 91-2938, (La. 1992);
  <a href="../SC/1992-10-30_1991-2938.htm">610 So.2d 787</a></span>, the Court publicly reprimanded an attorney for
  failing to return $3,125 of unearned fees.  If Mouton failed to return the fee with interest, ODC would have been
  permitted to seek a suspension.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the case of <span class="CITE"><i>In re Laiche</i>,
  <a href="1999-07-15_98-DB-057.htm">98-DB-057</a> (Disc. Bd. 7/15/99)</span>, the attorney was publicly reprimanded
  for five counts involving failure to keep his clients informed; failure to diligently move the case along over eight
  years; failure to inform clients of a settlement offer, which he rejected; refused to hand over the files and execute
  a motion to substitute counsel for months; and failed to respond to the disciplinary complaint.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The record supports the mitigating factors of absence of a prior disciplinary record and full and
  free disclosure to the disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward the proceedings and inexperience in the
  practice of law.  The record supports the aggravating factor of vulnerability of victim.  Mr. Mohammed, an Indian
  national working legally in this country when he sustained a serious job related injury, was compelled to return home
  due to family illness.  Respondent was entrusted with concluding Mr. Mohammed's claim and forwarding his funds.  In
  May 1999, Respondent forwarded his client's settlement documents and funds but thereafter received a request for a
  more detailed explanation of costs and expenses.  On July 12, 2002, Respondent obtained the Worker's Compensation
  judge's ruling regarding interpreter and transportation costs.  Three years after his request for an explanation of
  costs and expenses, Mr. Mohammed received a refund of costs, expenses and interest for $14,411.74.<a href="#_ftn13"
  name="_ftnref13" class="fn" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The case law and ABA Standards support a public reprimand.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing;</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted, and that Respondent,

    agreement shall be in writing and shall state the method by which the fee is to be determined, including the
    percentage or percentages that shall accrue to the lawyer in the event of settlement, trial or appeal litigation
    and other expenses to be deducted from the recovery, and whether such expenses are to be deducted before or after
    the contingent fee is calculated.  Upon conclusion of a contingent fee matter, the lawyer shall provide the client
    with a written statement stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is a recovery, showing the remittance to
    the client and the method of its determination.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(d) A lawyer shall not enter into an arrangement for, charge, or collect:</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(1) Any fee in a domestic relations matter, the payment or amount of which is contingent
    upon the securing of a divorce or upon the amount of alimony or support, or property settlement in lieu thereof;

    <p class="footnotetext">(2) The client is advised of and does not object to the participation of all the lawyers
    involved;  and</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(3) The total fee is reasonable.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(f) Payment of fees in advance of services shall be subject to the following rules:</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(1) When the client pays the lawyer a fee to retain the lawyer's general availability to
    the client and the fee is not related to a particular representation, the funds become the property of the lawyer
    when paid and may be placed in the lawyer's operating account.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(2) When the client pays the lawyer all or part of a fixed fee or of a minimum fee for
    particular representation with services to be rendered in the future, the funds become the property of the lawyer
    when paid, subject to the provisions of Rule 1.5(f)(6).  Such funds need not be placed in the lawyer's trust
    account, but may be placed in the lawyer's operating account.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(3) When the client pays the lawyer an advance deposit against fees which are to accrue in
    the future on an hourly or other agreed basis, the funds remain the property of the client and must be placed in
    the lawyer's trust account.  The lawyer may transfer these funds as fees are earned from the trust account to the
    operating account, without further authorization from the client for each transfer, but must render a periodic
    accounting for these funds as is reasonable under the circumstances.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(4) When the client pays the lawyer an advance deposit to be used for costs and expenses,
    the funds remain the property of the client and must be placed in the lawyer's trust account.  The lawyer may
    expend these funds as costs and expenses accrue, without further authorization from the client for each
    expenditure, but must render a periodic accounting for these funds as is reasonable under the circumstances.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(5) The fee under Rule 1.5(f)(1), (2), or (3) must be reasonable under the circumstances,
    and the contract between the lawyer and the client regarding the fee should preferably be in writing and should
    specify the basis on which fee payments are to be made.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(6) When the client pays the lawyer a fixed fee or a minimum fee for particular services to
    be rendered in the future under Rule 1.5(f)(2) and the funds are placed in the lawyer's operating account, and a
    fee dispute subsequently arises between the lawyer and the client, either during the course of the representation
    or at the termination of the representation, the lawyer shall immediately refund to the client the unearned portion
    of the fee, if any.  If the lawyer and the client cannot agree on the amount of unearned fee, the lawyer shall
    immediately refund to the client the amount, if any, that the parties agree has not been earned, and the lawyer
    shall deposit into a trust account an amount which represents the portion of the fee which is reasonably in
    dispute.  The funds shall be held in the trust account until the dispute is resolved, and the lawyer may not hold
    the disputed portion of the funds to coerce a client into accepting the lawyer's contentions.  The lawyer should
    also suggest means for a prompt resolution of the dispute such as the Louisiana State Bar Association Fee Dispute
    Program or other similar arbitration.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(d) Prior to the conclusion of representation of a client, a lawyer shall not make or

    existence and nature of all the claims or pleas involved and of the participation of each person in the
    settlement.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(h) A lawyer shall not make an agreement prospectively limiting the lawyer's liability to a
    client for malpractice unless permitted by law and the client is independently represented in making the agreement,
    or settle a claim for such liability with an unrepresented client or former client without first advising that
    person in writing that independent representation is appropriate in connection therewith.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(i) A lawyer related to another lawyer as parent, child, sibling or spouse shall not
    represent a client in a representation directly adverse to a person who the lawyer knows is represented by the
    other lawyer except upon consent by the client after consultation regarding the relationship.</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(j) A lawyer shall not acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject
    matter of litigation the lawyer is conducting for a client, except that the lawyer may:</p>

    <p class="footnotetext">(2) Contract with a client for a reasonable contingent fee in a civil case.</p>

    documents.  An attorney may obtain a client's authorization to endorse and negotiate an instrument given in
