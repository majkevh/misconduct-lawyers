IN RE: DARYL GOLD<br>

<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>PER CURIAM*</p>
<p>***************************************************************************</p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from three consolidated sets of formal involving a total of seven counts of misconduct instituted by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Daryl Gold, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana.'</font></p>
<p><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></p>
<p><span class="CITE"><b>96-DB-039</b></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These charges arise from respondent's representation of Gerald Kennedy, a criminal inmate. Mr. Kennedy paid a $10,000 fee to respondent to represent him in connection with a parole matter.&nbsp; Respondent &quot;guaranteed&quot; that Mr. Kennedy would be granted parole.&nbsp; However, according to Mr. Kennedy, respondent failed to attend a parole hearing on his behalf or to request a continuance. After Mr. Kennedy filed a complaint with the ODC in 1993, respondent failed to comply with the ODC's requests for information pertaining to the complaint.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="CITE"><font size="3"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;96-DB-077</b></font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These charges arise from respondent's failure to comply with the ODC's requests for information regarding two separate complaints filed against him in July of 1996. In both cases, the ODC had subpoenas personally served on respondent compelling his cooperation, but he failed to comply.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="CITE"><font size="3"><b>97-DB-012</b></font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyTextIndent2"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This charge arises from a complaint filed with the ODC on August 17, 1995 by JoAnn Bohannon against respondent. While respondent answered an initial request for information from the ODC, he failed to provide a supplemental response to a letter dated March 7, 1996. Ultimately, the ODC issued a subpoena ordering him to appear for a scheduled deposition. On the morning of the deposition, respondent's office called the ODC to advise that respondent would not attend.&nbsp; Later, respondent provided an untimely supplemental respoise to the ODC's request.</font></span></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another client, Larry Williams, filed a separate complaint against respondent on lanuuy 19, 1996. While respondent answered the ODC's initial requests for information, he failed to provide a supplemental reply to a letter forwarded on June 20, 1996. Ultimately, a subpoena was issued ordering him to appear for a scheduled deposition. On the morning of the deposition, the respondent's secretary called to advise the ODC that respondent would not attend his deposition since he was in a trial.&nbsp; Later, the respondent provided documents responsive to the subpoena.&nbsp; Subsequently, respondent failed to submit additional information as requested on October 7, 1996.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></font></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the complaints were filed, the ODC conducted an investigation. Subsequently, the ODC instituted formal charges against respondent, alleging several violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. In connection with the Kennedy matter, the ODC alleged respondent (neglected a legal matter, in violation of</font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"><font face='Times New Roman'> Rule </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.3'></a>,<font size="3"><sup>2</sup></font><font size="3" color="#000000"> collected a contingency fee in a criminal matter, in violation of </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"><font face='Times New Roman'>Rule </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.5'></a>(d)(2),<font size="3"><sup>3</sup></font><font size="3" color="#000000"> and improperly promised an outcome in a criminal matter, in violation of</font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"><font face='Times New Roman'> Rule </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE7.1'></a>.<font size="3"><sup>4</sup></font><font size="3" color="#000000"><sup> </sup></font><font size="3" color="#000000">In connection with the other charges, the ODC alleged the respondent failed </font><span class="BodyText"><font color="#000000">to cooperate in the disciplinary investigation, in violation of </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"><font face='Times New Roman'>Rule </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a>(g).<sup>5</sup><font color="#000000">&nbsp; Respondent filed answers to each of the charges. While admitting that he failed to timely respond to the ODC's requests for information, he essentially denied all other misconduct.</font><p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The matters were consolidated and a hearing was conducted where several parties testified, including respondent and his secretary. As to the Kennedy matter, the respondent admitted he was paid $10,000 in cash, but it was for past services rendered to Mr. Kennedy's wife in a succession matter.&nbsp; He stated Mr. Kennedy still owed him $13,000 from his past representation of him in several criminal matters. Respondent provided evidence showing Mr. Kennedy was not eligible for parole until 1995, two years after the complaint was filed; thus, respondent asserted he could not have failed to show for a parole hearing as alleged in the complaint.</font></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, respondent admitted that he failed to timely respond to the ODC's requests for information. As to his failure to appear for the scheduled depositions, respondent testified that he was in the middle of a capital murder case that lasted several weeks and his secretary should have advised the ODC of the conflicts. Respondent's secretary corroborated respondent's testimony stating that, due to her calendering error,&nbsp; the ODC was not timely notified.</font></span></p>
<p><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Abd31?an=JD_HC9639 --##'><font size="3"><b>Hearing Committee Recommendation</b></font></a><font size="3"><b></b></font></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hearing committee found the ODC failed to present clear and convincing evidence proving respondent neglected a legal matter, charged a contingency fee or promised an outcome in connection with the Kennedy matter. As to the remaining charge involving five counts of failure to cooperate, the hearing committee determined that, although respondent cooperated, he did so in an untimely manner. However, the committee did recognize some of the delays could be attributed to respondent's involvement in a lengthy murder trial and his secretary's calendarin </font></span><font size="3">errors.<br>
</font><span class="BodyText2"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The committee recognized several aggravating factors: prior discipline,</font><font size="3" color="#000000"><sup>6</sup></font><font size="3" color="#000000"> pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses and substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted&nbsp; 9/9/71). In mitigation, it noted the absence of a selfish or dishonest motive, cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings, and character and reputation. The committee recommended that respondent be publicly reprimanded for each complaint and that his present probation be extended for one year, with the condition that he respond to all future complaints within fifteen days. The ODC objected to the leniency of the sanction.</font></span></p>
<p><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A6a37?an=JD_96-DB-039 --##'>Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The disciplinary board concurred in the findings of the hearing committee that the ODC proved by clear and convincing evidence that respondent was guilty of five counts of failure to cooperate as charged. It adopted the aggravating factors cited by the committee.&nbsp; However, in mitigation, it pointed out that the present charges were being investigated at the same time as the charges at issue in </font><span class="CITE"><font size="3"><i>In re: Gold,</i></font><font size="3"> 96-2526 (La. 4/18/97), 693 So.2d 148</font></span>, and that all of the charges could have been brought at the same time and dispensed in one proceeding. Notwithstanding that finding, the disciplinary board relied on ABA Standard 8.2<font size="3"><sup>7</sup></font><font size="3"> and deviated upward from the recommendation of the committee, instead proposing that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of three months.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondent filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation, and the case was set for oral argument before this court pursuant to </font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The record supports the hearing committee's factual finding that respondent failed to cooperate in the disciplinary investigations, as charged. Moreover, the sanction for such misconduct ordinarily would be a reprimand, as recommended by the committee. The board decided to recommend a suspension because respondent previously had been reprimanded for similar misconduct.</font></span></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this court's April 1997 opinion, we noted respondent's prior disciplinary history and warned him that any future misconduct would be treated harshly. If the misconduct at issue had occurred after that warning in our 1997 opinion, we would be inclined to impose a very lengthy suspension. However, the instant misconduct occurred prior to that opinion and could have been considered and dealt with in that opinion.</font></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For that reason, we conclude that the additional public reprimand and extension of probation recommended by the committee is the more appropriate sanction. We take this opportunity to again caution respondent that any future misconduct, including the failure to cooperate in disciplinary proceedings, will be viewed in a very harsh light by this court and may be the basis for a substantial suspension.</font></span></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>DECREE</b></font></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, briefs and oral argument, it is ordered that respondent, Daryl Gold, be </font><font face='Times New Roman'>publicly reprimanded</font><font size="3" color="#000000"> and that the two year period of</font><font face='Times New Roman'> probation</font><font size="3" color="#000000"> imposed on April 18, 1997 be </font><font face='Times New Roman'>extended for one year</font><font size="3" color="#000000"> from the finality of this decision.&nbsp; Respondent is assessed with all costs and expenses of this proceeding in accordance with </font></span></p>
