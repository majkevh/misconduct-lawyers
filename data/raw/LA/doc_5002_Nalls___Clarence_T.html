  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 06-B-0257</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: CLARENCE T. NALLS, JR.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that
  respondent filed and pursued a frivolous lawsuit on behalf of a client. Prior to the filing of formal charges,
  respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent discipline in which respondent admitted that his
  conduct violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.16(a)(1)</span> (failure to decline or terminate a representation when the representation will result in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law), <span class="Rules">3.1</span> (meritorious claims and contentions), and <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.
  Having reviewed the petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Clarence T. Nalls,
  Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 1500, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year and one day. This
  suspension shall be deferred in its entirety, subject to respondent's successful completion of a two-year period of
  probation governed by the terms and conditions set forth in the Petition for Consent Discipline. Any failure of
  respondent to comply with the conditions of probation, or any misconduct during the probationary period, may be
  grounds for making the deferred suspension executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
