  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 00-B-1939</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: JOHNNIE A. JONES, SR.</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from the filing of formal charges by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Johnnie A. Jones, Sr., an attorney licensed to practice law in the
  State of Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <h3>The Davis Matter</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">On February 6, 1995, Alyssa Davis retained respondent to represent her in a personal injury
  matter after she discharged her former attorney, L.D. Sledge. Pursuant to the contract between respondent and Ms.
  Davis, respondent was entitled to receive a maximum 40% contingency fee.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Subsequently, respondent negotiated a settlement on behalf of his client. Respondent withheld his
  40% contingency fee from the disbursement. However, he also withheld an additional sum of $1,144.94 from the client's
  portion of the settlement, representing the negotiated amount in fees due to Mr.
  Sledge.<a name="_ednref1" class="fn" id="_ednref1" href="#_edn1">1</a> Respondent never mentioned to
  his client that he was not entitled to retain the excess amount of attorney's fees.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Ms. Davis filed a complaint with the ODC. After receiving the complaint, respondent adhered to
  his position that he was entitled to withhold Mr. Sledge's attorney fee from Ms. Davis' portion of the settlement,
  rather than from his 40% contingency fee, despite controlling law to the contrary.</p>

  <h3>The Mitchell Matter</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In an unrelated matter, Clem Mitchell retained respondent to represent him in a criminal case, as
  well as related civil service and worker's compensation proceedings. Mr. Mitchell paid respondent $7,000 for the full
  representation on November 29, 1997. Respondent performed minimal work on behalf of Mr. Mitchell. Two months later,
  Mr. Mitchell discharged respondent and requested an accounting and return of the unearned fee. Respondent failed to
  comply with either request, alleging he earned the entire fee.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC filed formal charges in the Davis and Mitchell matters, alleging violations of Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.5</span> (failure to assess reasonable fee), <span class="allegedrules">1.5(f)(6)</span>
  (failure to refund unearned fee or place funds in trust when fee dispute arose),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.15(b)</span> (failure to safe keep client property) and
  <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> (failure to protect client interests at termination of representation) of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct. Although respondent did not file an answer to the charges, he requested that he be
  given the opportunity to attend the hearing.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">A formal hearing was conducted and respondent represented himself in proper person. As to the
  Davis matter, respondent testified he failed to see what he did wrong. He alleged Ms. Davis never told him about any
  amounts owed to Mr. Sledge and that he would not have taken the case if he thought Mr. Sledge's monetary interests
  would have impinged on his contractual entitlement to his legal fee. Because Mr. Sledge's fee was a debt incurred by
  Ms. Davis, respondent reasoned she should be accountable for the amount.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As to the Mitchell matter, respondent testified he fully earned the $7,000 fee through the course
  of his representation. However, Mr. Mitchell testified respondent provided very few services, some of which were
  detrimental to him. He stated he terminated respondent from his case two months after payment of the legal fee
  because he was unsatisfied with respondent's handling of the matter. Kevin Monahan, Mr. Mitchell's new counsel, and
  Tracey Ewing, the assistant district attorney assigned the criminal case, testified Mr. Monahan performed the
  overwhelming majority of the work on Mr. Mitchell's case. Ms. Ewing maintained she had virtually no contact with
  respondent during his short tenure as representing counsel.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">At the conclusion of the hearing, the committee requested that each of the parties file a
  post-hearing brief. Moreover, it requested that respondent produce his financial records regarding the clients at
  issue. Respondent failed to comply in any respect.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/1999-11-08_99-DB-004.htm">Hearing Committee Report</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">As to the Davis matter, the hearing committee found respondent violated Rule
  <span class="Rules">1.15</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct by wrongfully disbursing funds belonging to his
  client. It cited this court's opinion in <i>Saucier v. Hayes Dairy Products,</i> 373 So.2d 102 (La. 1978) (on
  rehearing), for the proposition that in cases where an attorney is discharged and a subsequent attorney is hired, the
  client should be exposed to no more than one contingency fee.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As to the Mitchell matter, the committee found respondent failed to account for his fee. However,
  the committee found insufficient evidence of a violation of Rule <span class="Rules">1.5(f)(6)</span>, relating to a
  failure to return unearned fees, because it was unclear which part of the fee should be
  returned.<a name="_ednref2" class="fn" id="_ednref2" href="#_edn2">2</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In determining a sanction, the committee relied on the presence of several aggravating factors,
  finding a <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">refusal to acknowledge
  wrongful conduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">indifference to making restitution</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">indifference to proceedings</span> by failing to file post-hearing brief and requested
  financial information, flagrant disregard for the disciplinary process and <span class="ABAstandard">substantial
  experience in the practice of law</span>. Based on these factors, the hearing committee proposed respondent be
  suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year and one day. It further ordered respondent to make
  restitution in the amount of $1,500 to Ms. Davis, as well as submit to arbitration of the fee dispute with Mr.
  Mitchell.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2000-06-26_99-DB-004.htm">Disciplinary Board</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board concurred in most of the findings of the hearing committee. However, the
  board concluded the committee erred in failing to find a violation of Rule 1.5(f)(6), because the record indicated
  respondent did not place any of the disputed funds in his trust account and failed to provide an accounting to his
  clients. It further recognized respondent refused to provide requested financial information to the ODC. In addition
  to the aggravating factors cited by the hearing committee, it also considered respondent's prior
  discipline.<a name="_ednref3" class="fn" id="_ednref3" href="#_edn3">3</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">After considering these factors, the board adopted the committee's proposed sanction of a one
  year and one day suspension. Although it "strongly suggested" respondent submit to fee arbitration in the Mitchell
  matter, it did not recommend respondent be mandated to do so, as the hearing committee had suggested.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent filed an objection in this court to the disciplinary board's recommendation.
  Accordingly, the matter was docketed for oral argument pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11 (G)(1)(b).</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The record supports the conclusion of the hearing committee that the ODC proved the charged
  misconduct by clear and convincing evidence. Therefore, the sole issue presented for our consideration is the
  appropriate sanction for this misconduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In making a determination of the appropriate sanction, we are mindful that the purpose of lawyer
  disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to maintain appropriate standards of
  professional conduct to safeguard the public, to preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and to deter other
  lawyers from engaging in violations of the standards of the profession. <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Guidry</i>, <a href="1990-12-03_1988-0829.htm">571 So. 2d 161</a> (La. 1990)</span>. The discipline to be
  imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any
  aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">After reviewing the record, we believe that respondent's misconduct in the Davis and Mitchell
  matters results more from a misunderstanding of the applicable disciplinary rules than any dishonest motive.
  Ignorance of the disciplinary rules does not excuse respondent's misconduct. <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State
  Bar Ass'n v. Thalheim</i>, <a href="1987-04-06_1986-0822.htm">504 So. 2d 822</a>, 826 (La. 1987)</span>. However, the
  absence of a dishonest or selfish motive may be considered as a mitigating factor. <i>ABA Standards for Imposing
  Lawyer Discipline</i>, §9.32(b). We also take notice of the fact that respondent, who is 81 years old, has been
  admitted to the bar since 1953 and has had only one prior serious disciplinary infraction during his long career.
  That disciplinary offense, which occurred over twenty years ago, is so remote in time as to not be considered an
  aggravating factor. <i>ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Discipline</i>, §9.32(m).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Under these circumstances, we conclude the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct is a
  suspension from the practice of law for a period of one year.<a name="_ednref4" class="fn" id="_ednref4" href="#_edn4">4</a> We further order respondent to submit to fee arbitration in both the Davis and
  Mitchell matters under the auspices of the Louisiana State Bar Association and refund any improper or unearned fees
  as determined after arbitration.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and the record filed herein, it is the decision of the court that respondent, Johnnie A. Jones, Sr., be suspended
  from the practice of law for a period of one year. Respondent is further ordered to submit to fee arbitration through
  the Louisiana State Bar Association for resolution of the Davis and Mitchell matters and refund any improper or
  unearned fees. All costs and expenses of these proceedings are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, § 10.1 , with legal interest commencing thirty days from the date from the finality of the court's
  judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_edn1" class="fn" id="_edn1" href="#_ednref1">1</a> The record indicates Mr.
  Sledge's negotiated legal fee was $1,500.00 with $355.06 of the amount representing his litigation costs. However,
  respondent indicates in his brief that Mr. Sledge's "out-of pocket" expenses are actually $437.84.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_edn2" class="fn" id="_edn2" href="#_ednref2">2</a> Although the committee stated
  there was insufficient evidence of a violation of Rule 1.15, it is obvious the committee intended to cite Rule 1.5,
  which relates to a failure to refund unearned fees.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_edn3" class="fn" id="_edn3" href="#_ednref3">3</a> Respondent was suspended from
  the practice of law for six months stemming from his commingling of clients' funds over a period of several years.
  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Jones</i>, <a href="1979-06-25_61799.htm">372 So. 2d 1186</a> (La.
  1979)</span>. In addition, respondent received a private reprimand in 1978.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_edn4" class="fn" id="_edn4" href="#_ednref4">4</a> As a result, respondent will not
  be required to file a petition for reinstatement under the provisions of Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24.</p>

  <p class="hiddenblock"><span class="Rules">1.5</span>, <span class="Rules">1.5(f)(6)</span>,
  <span class="Rules">1.15(b)</span> and <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span></p>
