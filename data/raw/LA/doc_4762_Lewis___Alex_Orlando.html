  <h2>ORDER</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent is the subject of three sets of formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary
  Counsel ("ODC").  The first set of charges encompasses twelve counts of misconduct and alleges that respondent failed
  to competently represent his client, failed to communicate with his client, neglected a legal matter, failed to
  promptly remit funds to third-party medical providers, commingled and converted client and third-party funds,
  knowingly disobeyed a court order, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation.  The second set of
  charges encompasses four counts of misconduct and alleges that respondent negotiated a settlement draft before
  executing the release, then subsequently refused to return the release to the insurer.  In addition, respondent
  failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of that matter.  Finally, the third set of charges encompasses
  two counts of misconduct and alleges that respondent neglected a legal matter, failed to communicate with his client,
  engaged in dishonest and deceitful conduct, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation.  In addition
  to the three sets of pending formal charges, respondent is also the subject of seven open investigative files.</p>
