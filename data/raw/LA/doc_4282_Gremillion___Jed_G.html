  <p class="Bodycopy">These consolidated attorney disciplinary proceedings arise from two sets of formal charges filed
  by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Jed G. Gremillion, an attorney licensed to practice
  law in the State of Louisiana. The charges allege respondent violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span>
  (lack of due diligence), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to comply with reasonable requests for
  information), <span class="allegedrules">1.15(a)</span> (failure to keep funds of a client or third party separate

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <h3>98-B-0818</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This consent discipline proceeding involves three counts of formal charges emanating from one
  complaint filed by two complainants against the respondent regarding his representation in the matter entitled
  "<i>Succession of Eule Mouton,</i>" No. 94-64624, Fifteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Vermillion.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"><b>Count I:</b> While acting as counsel for the estate, respondent obtained judicial permission
  on June 17, 1994 to sell immovable property valued at $38,000 belonging to the estate. Subsequently, he failed to
  take any further action on behalf of the estate until January 22, 1996. He failed to account to the heirs or the
  court for succession property, and he disbursed succession property in the absence of court approval.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"><b>Count II:</b> Upon receiving $41,469.67 in succession funds from the testamentary executor,
  respondent deposited the funds in a bank account that was not labeled as a trust or fiduciary account. Without court
  approval, he proceeded to disburse the funds to certain heirs. Of the funds disbursed, three checks were issued, each
  in the amount of $1,888.49, to three heirs: Catherine Sellers Granger, Cindy Delvisco and Ruth Sellers Stelly. The
  checks were returned for insufficient funds.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"><b>Count III:</b> Respondent failed to appear pursuant to a subpoena for his scheduled deposition
  and production of documents issued in connection with the ODC's investigation into allegations of misconduct, set
  forth in the complaint filed by Ms. Granger and Ms. Stelly, regarding his representation in the succession
  matter.</p>

  <h3>98-B-0819</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The second proceeding involves three counts of formal charges arising from two complaints filed
  against the respondent. The hearing committee summarized the undisputed facts as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <b>Pam and Lynn Martin</b> 

    <p>These Complainants retained Respondent to represent them in connection with a September 9, 1990, boating
    accident. Numerous attempts thereafter were made by Complainants to contact Respondent about the matter. Respondent
    failed to answer to his clients' inquiries, and the Martins terminated him by letter of April 30, 1996.
    Complainants' new attorney requested the Martins' file, and Respondent repeatedly refused to relinquish it. The
    Martins wrote the Office of Disciplinary Counsel about the matter December 12, 1996.</p>

    <p>Respondent was furnished by certified mail a copy of the Martins' complaint by the Office of Disciplinary
    Counsel on January 3, 1997. Disciplinary Counsel demanded a response within fifteen days. See Rule XIX, §§ 4B(2),
    9C. Respondent ignored the Office of Disciplinary Counsel's request, and a subpoena was issued on March 7, 1997,
    and served on Respondent March 20, 1997. The subpoena commanded Respondent to appear at the Office of Disciplinary
    Counsel April 4, 1997, and bring with him "[T]he entire original file relating to your representation of Pam Martin
    and Lynn Martin." Respondent failed to appear and did not otherwise produce the file.</p><b>Brock A. Derouen</b> 

    <p>On May 20, 1994, Complainant's grandmother, Mildred Mergist Floris, retained Respondent to initiate and complete
    a succession. She paid him $1,300 at that time, and later paid him another $416.90. Respondent did not prepare an
    Affidavit of Death and Heirship until April 12, 1996, about two years after. Meanwhile, Mrs. Floris missed two
    sales of a house which was a part of the succession property. Respondent rarely returned his client's telephone
    calls.</p>

    <p>By undated letter (received by Disciplinary Counsel December 27, 1996), Mr. Derouen, on behalf of his
    grandmother, complained. By certified letter received by Respondent January 17, 1997, he was notified by the Office
    of Disciplinary Counsel of the complaint by Mrs. Floris. Respondent failed to answer or reply, and a subpoena was
    issued to him and served on him March 20, 1997. This same one was issued in connection with the Martin complaints,
    except that it required him to "[A]lso produce the entire file and <i>full financial records</i> relating to your
    representation of Mildred Mergist Floris." (emphasis in original). (Respondent failed to appear and did not
    otherwise produce the file and records).</p>* * * * * * 

    <p>Between the date Respondent failed to appear, produce documents and records, and otherwise explain himself,
    April 4, 1997, and the date Formal Charges were filed, September 15, 1997, he apparently did nothing in connection
    with these complaints from his clients nor did he cooperate with Disciplinary Counsel's investigative efforts.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>98-B-0818</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On August 22, 1996, the ODC filed formal charges alleging violations of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct. Respondent filed an answer denying the allegations to Count I, stating "all heirs have been presented an
  accounting." He admitted to the misconduct alleged in Counts II &amp; III.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On December 10, 1996, respondent submitted a motion for consent discipline suggesting an eighteen
  month suspension and the ODC concurred with the proposed discipline.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On November 14, 1997, <a href="../HC/1997-11-14_96-DB-057.htm">the hearing committee</a> issued
  its recommendation proposing adoption of the eighteen month consent discipline.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Relying on ABA Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.12</span> <a class="fn" href="#fn2"
  name="fnref2" id="fnref2">[FN1]</a> and jurisprudence from this court, <a href="../DB/1998-03-27_96-DB-057.htm">the
  disciplinary board</a> determined the baseline sanction in the instant case was a three year suspension. In
  mitigation, the board noted the <span class="ABAstandard">lack of a prior disciplinary record</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">full payment of restitution</span> prior to the institution of formal charges and
  cooperation with the ODC. Based on such, it recommended adoption of the proposed eighteen month suspension, finding
  it to be within the range of appropriate discipline established by this court. Further, the board recommended
  assessment of proceeding costs in the amount of $301.84.</p>

  <h3>98-B-0819</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On September 15, 1997, the ODC filed formal charges alleging violations of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct, and the respondent failed to answer. The ODC filed a brief seeking disbarment, noting the
  conduct was intentional and that since the filing of charges, the Martins' file has not been released and no action
  was taken on behalf of Ms. Floris in any respect.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On June 6, 1997, <a href="../HC/1997-12-29_97-db-057.htm">the hearing committee</a> rendered its
  findings concluding respondent violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4(a)</span>,
  <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> and <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span>. Relying on Standards
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.41</span>(b) and (c) of the <i>ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions,</i> the
  committee noted disbarment is generally the baseline sanction when a lawyer knowingly fails to perform a service for
  a client and causes potential serious injury, or when a lawyer engages in a pattern of neglect with respect to client
  matters and potentially causes serious injury to a client. As factors in aggravation, the committee recognized the
  eighteen month suspension in the consolidated proceeding [98-B-0818] as prior discipline <a class="fn" href="#fn3"
  name="fnref3" id="fnref3">[FN2]</a> and respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice
  of law</span> (admitted on 10/5/79). Also relying on the absence of mitigating factors, the committee recommended
  disbarment "with prejudice".</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On March 27, 1998, the board issued its
  <a href="../DB/1998-03-27_97-DB-057.htm">recommendation</a> concurring in the findings of the committee. It noted the
  baseline sanction for neglect of a client's legal matters and failure to communicate with clients was a three year
  suspension. Relying on the aggravating factors cited by the committee, as well as respondent's failure to cooperate,
  the board recommended disbarment. It further proposed assessment of proceedings costs in the amount of $235.61. One
  board member filed a dissent to the severity of the sanction noting a three year suspension would have been
  appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither the ODC nor respondent filed an objection to the board's recommendation. However,
  pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(G)(1)(a), we ordered the parties to submit briefs, without oral argument,
  addressing the issue of whether the sanction recommended by the disciplinary board was appropriate. The ODC filed its
  brief, asserting that disbarment was the appropriate sanction under the facts. Respondent failed to file a brief.</p>

  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the record in this matter, we conclude the hearing committee and disciplinary
  board erred in considering the "prior discipline" imposed in 98-B-0818 as an aggravating circumstance in 98-B-0819.
  Since the misconduct in each case occurred within the same time frame, this is not a case in which a lawyer is
  disciplined and then proceeds to commit similar misconduct, despite the warning to watch his step resulting from the
  initial discipline. Without prior discipline as an aggravating factor, a thirty-six month suspension is a more
  appropriate penalty in 98-B-0819, with this suspension to run concurrently with the eighteen month suspension imposed
  in 98-B-0818.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, it is ordered that respondent, Jed G. Gremillion, be suspended from the practice of
  law for a period of eighteen months in 98-B-0818 and a period of thirty-six months in 98-B-0819, with the penalties
  to run concurrently. It is further ordered that respondent make restitution to his clients. All costs of these
  proceedings in the amount of $537.45 are assessed against respondent.</p><span id="mTextDisplay"></span>
