  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-0338</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: DUKE ELLINGTON TILLEY, JR.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, Duke Ellington Tilley, Jr., a disbarred attorney.</p>

  <h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Before we address the current charges, we find it helpful to review respondent's prior
  disciplinary history. Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in Louisiana in 1992. In 1998, he was
  disciplined for the first time, in the form of an admonition by the disciplinary board, for neglecting a legal matter
  and failing to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation. In 2000, respondent was publicly reprimanded for failing
  to promptly return an unearned fee and failing to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On February 1, 2001 and April 10, 2001, respondent and the ODC filed joint petitions for consent
  discipline with the disciplinary board. The petitions proposed that respondent be disbarred for numerous instances of
  serious professional misconduct, including neglecting legal matters, failing to communicate with clients, charging an
  excessive fee, failing to provide an accounting and refund unearned fees, engaging in prohibited conflicts of
  interest, converting client funds to his own use, engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or
  misrepresentation, engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and failing to cooperate with
  the ODC in its investigation. The two petitions for consent discipline were consolidated by the board, which
  recommended the proposed discipline be accepted. On April 26, 2002, we accepted the petitions for consent discipline
  and disbarred respondent. <span class="cite">In re: Tilley, 01-2454 (La. 4/26/02),
  <a href="2002-04-26_2001-2454.htm">814 So. 2d 1289</a> ("Tilley I")</span>.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <h3>Count I</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was ordered to appear in the Baton Rouge City Court on October 31, 2001 to answer a
  judgment debtor rule filed against him as a defendant in a civil case. Respondent was not in the courtroom when the
  case was called because he was handling a criminal matter for a client, and a bench warrant was issued for his
  arrest. Shortly after the plaintiff's attorney left, respondent arrived for the rule and addressed the presiding
  judge, Judge Suzan Ponder, from the audience. Judge Ponder called the plaintiff's attorney, who informed her he would
  return to the courtroom immediately. As a result, Judge Ponder requested that respondent have a seat and wait.
  Respondent requested Judge Ponder's permission to go to the criminal court (where his clients' matters were pending)
  and inform that court that he needed to attend to his judgment debtor rule. Judge Ponder denied this request and
  directed respondent to remain in her courtroom. Nonetheless, respondent left the courtroom, informing the bailiff
  that he would "be right back." Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff's attorney returned to the courtroom. After
  approximately fifteen minutes, respondent returned to the courtroom and the plaintiff's attorney was able to conduct
  the judgment debtor examination.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In November 2001, Judge Ponder filed a disciplinary complaint against respondent for his failure
  to obey the court's orders.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a> In response to the complaint,
  respondent indicated he felt Judge Ponder's conduct was "an abuse of her discretion and not within the proper decorum
  that a judge should exhibit against another officer of the court."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct constituted a violation of Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">3.4(c)</span> (knowing disobedience of an obligation under the rules of a tribunal) and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count II</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In April 2000, James and Valerie Favorite retained respondent to represent their son in a
  criminal matter. Mr. Favorite signed a contract of employment in which he agreed to pay a flat fee of $10,000 plus
  expenses if the case was resolved without a trial and $15,000 if it went to trial. Thereafter, the Favorites paid
  respondent a total of $10,000 in three installments. Approximately six months later, before the conclusion of the
  criminal case, the Favorites terminated respondent and hired another attorney. Their new attorney requested a copy of
  respondent's file, an accounting, and a refund of unearned fees. Respondent failed to provide an accounting or refund
  any unearned fees, and he declined to participate in the Louisiana State Bar Association's Alternative Fee Dispute
  Resolution program.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In May 2002, the Favorites filed a disciplinary complaint against respondent, alleging the
  following: (1) he took their money but did no work on the case, (2) he failed to communicate with their son regarding
  his case, (3) he failed to provide them with status updates, and (4) he failed to hire an investigator pursuant to
  their requests. In response to the complaint, respondent asserted that he had earned the entire $10,000 fee by the
  time he was terminated because he had spent more than 120 hours working on the case. He also stated that the
  Favorites had no legitimate reason to change attorneys. Respondent explained that he (1) filed a motion for and was
  granted a preliminary examination, (2) filed a motion to have bail set and another motion to reduce bail, eventually
  succeeding in getting bail reduced so the Favorites could post a bond for their son, (3) filed motions to discover
  the names of witnesses and read witness transcripts, (4) visited his client in jail several times and received
  collect calls from him, (5) visited the Favorites at their home to explain his strategy and the purpose of the
  motions, (6) interviewed witnesses at his office, at the jail, and at the Favorites' home, (7) filed a motion to get
  permission to interview the state's witnesses, and (8) conducted extensive research in preparation of several
  defenses for the case. Respondent further claimed that the Favorites owed him an additional $5,000 because he had
  been preparing for trial when he was terminated and that they should have paid him instead of posting bail for their
  son.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct constituted a violation of Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a
  client), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a client), and
  <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> (obligations upon termination of the representation) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count III</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In October 2000, Virgie Hart paid respondent $625 to handle her aunt's succession. Respondent
  sent letters to various banks and ascertained that the decedent's estate was worth only $656.98. After encountering
  other problems,<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a> respondent concluded it would not be
  economically feasible to open a succession. Instead, respondent decided to request the $656.98 directly from the bank
  by presenting an original sealed copy of the decedent's will and a certified copy of her death certificate. However,
  respondent was disbarred in Tilley I before he was able to complete this task.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3"
  id="fnref3">3</a> Respondent failed to keep Ms. Hart advised of the status of her case throughout the representation,
  and thereafter, failed to inform her of his disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In May 2002, Ms. Hart filed a disciplinary complaint against respondent, alleging that he
  neglected her legal matter and failed to communicate with her. She also stated that his office was always locked and
  his telephone was recently disconnected. Furthermore, she requested the return of the legal fee she paid. After
  receiving at least two letters from the ODC, respondent responded to the complaint, indicating he would send Ms. Hart
  the will and death certificate in his possession and would refund the fees she had paid him. Ms. Hart eventually
  received the will and death certificate, but never received a refund of the legal fee she paid to respondent.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct constituted a violation of Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(d), and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count IV</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In November 2001, Warren Scott, III retained respondent to handle several criminal matters on his
  behalf. In May 2002, Mr. Scott filed a disciplinary complaint against respondent, alleging that respondent failed to
  follow his instructions regarding his defense, failed to adequately communicate with him, failed to inform him of his
  disciplinary problems, did not earn his fee, and failed to provide him with a copy of his entire file following his
  disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In response to the complaint, respondent stated that Mr. Scott and his parents "think they know
  the law and try to run the defense." He further stated that he explained to Mr. Scott's parents that he "would not
  tolerate their interference in [his] representation of their son, nor would [he] allow him to be co-counsel."
  Respondent also claimed he thoroughly evaluated all of Mr. Scott's cases, conferred with the prosecutor to get some
  of the charges withdrawn, interviewed witnesses, requested the issuance of subpoenas, and filed a motion to sever the
  charges. He further claimed to have informed Mr. Scott and his parents of his strategies. Respondent was disbarred
  before the motion to sever was heard, but asserted that Mr. Scott's parents were behind on their payments and still
  owed him for the work he had performed.  The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct constituted a violation of Rules
  1.3, 1.4, and 1.16(d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count V</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In February 2002, two months before he was disbarred but after he entered into the joint
  petitions for consent discipline forming the basis of Tilley I, respondent was retained by Stella Tillman to
  represent her son in a criminal matter. Respondent failed to inform Ms. Tillman that his disbarment was pending and
  accepted five payments from her totaling $2,800. Two of the payments were made subsequent to respondent's
  disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In October 2002, Ms. Tillman filed a disciplinary complaint against respondent, alleging that he
  neglected her son's criminal matter and failed to communicate with them. At the formal hearing of this matter,
  respondent claimed he met with both Ms. Tillman and her son, filed the required motions, and appeared at the
  arraignment. He also planned to negotiate a plea bargain on his client's behalf but was disbarred before he was able
  to do so. Respondent stated that he would refund the money Ms. Tillman paid him.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct constituted a violation of Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 8.4(c)
  (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed five counts of formal charges against respondent on September 8, 2003. Respondent
  was served with the charges and answered with a general denial. The matter proceeded to a formal hearing before the
  hearing committee. Respondent, Judge Ponder, Mr. and Mrs. Favorite, Ms. Hart, and Ms. Tillman testified in person
  before the committee. The ODC was unable to serve Mr. Scott with a hearing subpoena, and accordingly, the evidence
  relating to Count IV was proffered.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-08-16_03-DB-062.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In Count I, the hearing committee found respondent failed to appear as directed in Judge Ponder's
  courtroom, resulting in the court issuing a bench warrant for his arrest. Although respondent returned to the
  courtroom, he later left to attend to other matters despite Judge Ponder's order that he remain until the judgment
  debtor rule could be conducted. Based on these factual findings, the committee determined that respondent violated
  Rules <span class="Rules">3.4(c)</span> and <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Turning to Count II, the committee found that respondent's client was Donald Favorite, although
  Donald's parents paid respondent a fee of $10,000. Because Donald did not testify at the hearing, and no evidence was
  presented that respondent failed to communicate with him, the committee found the ODC failed to prove respondent
  violated Rules 1.3 or 1.4. However, the committee found respondent failed to provide the Favorites with an accounting
  or refund any unearned fee following their termination of the representation. Based on this factual finding, the
  committee determined that respondent violated Rule <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As to Count III, the committee determined Ms. Hart hired respondent to locate and procure assets
  of her aunt's succession, paying him a total of $625. It found respondent's testimony regarding the attempts he made
  to identify bank accounts and other assets of Ms. Hart's aunt to be credible. However, it concluded respondent did
  not keep Ms. Hart advised of the status of the case, despite her numerous attempts to communicate with him.
  Additionally, the committee found respondent failed to refund Ms. Hart's money or provide an accounting. Based on
  these factual findings, the committee determined that respondent violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.4</span> and
  1.16(d). The committee found the ODC failed to prove a violation of Rules 1.3 and 8.1(c).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After considering Count IV, the committee observed that the ODC submitted no testimony in support
  of this count. It further determined that all of the ODC's proffered exhibits are hearsay. Accordingly, the committee
  found the ODC failed to prove any violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Turning to count V, the committee determined that respondent's client was Shedrick Tillman,
  although he was hired by Ms. Tillman. Because Shedrick Tillman did not testify at the hearing, and no evidence was
  presented that respondent failed to communicate with him, the committee found the ODC failed to prove a violation of
  Rules 1.3 and 1.4. However, the committee determined respondent failed to advise Ms. Tillman of his pending consent
  discipline and subsequent disbarment and accepted payments from her despite the fact that he would not be able to
  complete the work for which he had been retained. Based on these factual findings, the committee determined that
  respondent violated Rule <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, the committee determined that respondent acted knowingly
  and caused injury to his clients and the legal system. The baseline sanction for his misconduct is a suspension from
  the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the committee recognized respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">prior
  disciplinary offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">a pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>, and
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span> (admitted 1992). The committee found
  no mitigating factors are present.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, the committee determined that respondent's misconduct warranted a
  three-year suspension from the practice of law. The committee recommended that respondent be required to refund
  unearned fees due to Ms. Hart and Ms. Tillman and pay all costs of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2005-02-01_03-DB-062.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the record of this matter, the disciplinary board adopted the hearing committee's
  factual findings and application of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The board found that respondent violated
  duties owed to his clients, the legal system, and as a professional. His conduct was intentional and caused
  substantial harm.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board agreed with the aggravating factors as found by the committee and also agreed that no
  mitigating factors are present. It further agreed that the appropriate baseline sanction is a suspension from the
  practice of law. The board then turned to consideration of permanent disbarment under
  <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 9</span> (instances of serious attorney misconduct preceded by suspension or
  disbarment for prior instances of serious attorney misconduct) of Supreme Court Rule XIX, Appendix E. Reasoning that
  "respondent's commission of serious acts of misconduct while having knowledge of his imminent disbarment, coupled
  with his acceptance of fees following his actual disbarment, places him within the purview of this guideline," the
  board recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred. The board also recommended that respondent be ordered to
  provide an accounting to the Favorites, make restitution to Ms. Hart and Ms. Tillman, and be assessed with all costs
  and expenses of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Although neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the board's recommendation, this
  court ordered briefing addressing the issue of an appropriate sanction. Both respondent and the ODC filed briefs in
  response to the court's order.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316
  (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in
  any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the
  manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings. See <span class="cite">In re: Caulfield,
  96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class="cite">In re:
  Pardue, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on our review of the record, we conclude there is no error in the hearing committee's
  detailed factual findings. The evidence in the record establishes in a clear and convincing fashion that respondent
  disobeyed a direct court order, failed to provide an accounting to Mr. and Mrs. Favorite, failed to refund fees owed
  to two of his clients, failed to keep Ms. Hart apprised of his work on her aunt's succession matter, and engaged in
  dishonest conduct when he accepted legal fees from Ms. Tillman during and after the proceedings in Tilley I. This
  conduct constitutes a violation of Rules 1.4, 1.16(d), 3.4(c), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d) of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found evidence of professional misconduct, we now turn to a determination of an
  appropriate sanction. In considering that issue, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to
  maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future
  misconduct. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d
  1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of
  the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a>
  (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, we find our opinion in <span class="cite">In re: Turnage,
  03-0456 (La. 9/26/03), <a href="2003-09-25_2003-0456.htm">856 So. 2d 1183</a></span>, to be instructive. In Turnage,
  the respondent's misconduct was similar to the misconduct at issue in the instant case, involving failure to act with
  diligence, failure to communicate, failure to properly terminate representation, and disobedience of an obligation
  under the rules of a tribunal. We concluded a three-year suspension was an appropriate sanction for this
  misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Nonetheless, the disciplinary board urges us to consider permanently disbarring respondent
  pursuant to Guideline 9 of the permanent disbarment guidelines, which applies to "instances of serious attorney
  misconduct preceded by suspension or disbarment for prior instances of serious attorney misconduct." [emphasis
  added]. Although the board concedes that the bulk of respondent's current misconduct did not precede his disbarment
  in Tilley I, it suggests the case falls within the spirit of Guideline 9 because respondent was aware that his
  petition for consent discipline in Tilley I, in which he sought disbarment, was pending at the time he engaged in the
  instant misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">It is well settled that the permanent disbarment guidelines are illustrative in nature and are
  not intended to bind this court in its decision-making process. See <span class="cite">In re Edwards, 04-0290 (La.
  7/2/04), <a href="2004-07-02_2004-0290.htm">879 So. 2d 718</a></span>. Nonetheless, we see no justification to depart
  from the language of Guideline 9 under the facts of this case. Although it was likely that respondent would be
  disbarred at the time he committed the instant misconduct, the fact remains that he was not disbarred. Under these
  circumstances, we believe the imposition of permanent disbarment would be unduly punitive.<a name="fnref4" class="fn"
  href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we find the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct is a three-year
  suspension. Because respondent is currently disbarred and may not seek readmission until five years have passed from
  the effective date of our judgment in Tilley I, the three-year suspension we now impose shall run consecutively, with
  the effect that respondent may not seek readmission until a total of eight years have passed since the effective date
  of his disbarment in Tilley I. See, e.g., <span class="cite">In re: White, 00-2732 (La. 4/25/01),
  <a href="2001-04-25_2000-2732.htm">791 So. 2d 602</a></span>.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Duke Ellington Tilley, Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 21915, be
  suspended from the practice of law for a period of three years, to run consecutively to the minimum five-year period
  for seeking readmission from the disbarment imposed in In re: Tilley, 01-2454 (La. 4/26/02),
  <a href="2002-04-26_2001-2454.htm">814 So. 2d 1289.</a> Respondent is ordered to provide a complete accounting to
  James and Valerie Favorite and to refund any unearned portion of the legal fee he was paid in that matter. Respondent
  is further ordered to make restitution to Virgie Hart in the amount of $625 and to Stella Tillman in the amount of
  $2,800. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule
  XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until
  paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> Judge Ponder also scheduled a contempt
  rule against respondent. When respondent failed to appear for the contempt hearing, a warrant was issued for his
  arrest. Eventually, respondent appeared to answer the contempt charge and was fined $100, which he paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">2</a> Apparently, an elderly relative of Ms.
  Hart's had a key to the decedent's dent's safety deposit box but refused to turn it over to Ms. Hart or tell her
  where the box was located. Respondent also had trouble locating the notary and witnesses who signed the will.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3" id="fn3">3</a> Ms. Hart eventually obtained the
  $656.98 from the bank without respondent's assistance.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4" class="fn" href="#fnref4" id="fn4">4</a> We note that over a year elapsed
  between the filing of the petitions for consent discipline and the date we ultimately imposed discipline in Tilley I.
  Our subsequent amendment of the consent discipline provisions in Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 20 now mandates that
  petitions for consent discipline are filed directly in this court, allowing for more expeditious consideration of
  these petitions. Accordingly, the delay between the filing of the petition and its disposition which occurred in this
  case should not reoccur in the future.</p>
