<p class='footnotetitle'>FOOTNOTES:</p>
<p class='footnote'>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Katz's testimony focused on the fact that he profited less than his co-conspirator, yet he was sentenced more severely.&nbsp; Rejecting that contention, the Disciplinary Board in its recommendation to this court noted that '[t]he fact that one co-conspirator profited more than the other, is not a relevant factor in assessing discipline in this instance.'</p>
<p class='footnote'><font size="3">2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both the Hearing Committee and the Board considered the following mitigating circumstances: (i) no prior disciplinary record; (ii) full and free disclosure to the Board and cooperation with disciplinary proceedings; and</font><font size="2"> (iii)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the imposition of other penalties and sanctions, i.e., the fine, order of restitution and imprisonment.</font></p>
