<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA<br>
NO. 99-B-0608<br>
IN RE: CHARLES J. PISANO</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>PER CURIAM* </p>
<p>*************************************************************************************</p>
<p><span class="BlockText">This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from one count of formal charges instituted by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) against respondent, Charles J. Pisano.'</span></p>
<p><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></p>
<p><span class="BlockText">In 1978, following the death of her husband, Mrs. Reta Reed entrusted substantially all of her cash assets to respondent for management on her behalf. Thereafter, respondent converted over $400,000 of these funds for his own use.</span></p>
<p><span class="BlockText">In February, 1983, respondent gave Mrs. Reed a promissory note in the amount of $407,777.45, representing the amount of funds he converted.&nbsp; Respondent made occasional interest payments on this note until 1990.&nbsp; He made very few, if any, payments after that date, and the debt was never satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="BlockText">Subsequently, Mrs. Reed filed a civil lawsuit seeking recovery of her funds. On February 2, 1995, the district court rendered judgment in her favor for the amount of the promissory note, together with legal interest.&nbsp; The district court made a specific finding of fact that respondent had breached his fiduciary duties as Mrs. Reed's attorney in administering her financial affairs.</span></p>
<p>The record indicates that respondent has since left the State of Louisiana and his whereabouts are unknown. </p>
<p><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
<p>After investigation, the ODC instituted formal charges against respondent, alleging he violated <span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"><font face='Times New Roman'>Rule </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a>(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<font face='Times New Roman'><sup>2</sup></font><sup> </sup> Respondent failed to file an answer,<sup>3 </sup>and the matter was submitted to the hearing committee on documentary evidence, including various portions of the record of the civil action instituted by Mrs. Reed against respondent, as well as the deposition testimony of respondent's son.<p>
<p><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Ad949?an=JD_HC9776 --##'><b>Hearing Committee Recommendation</b></a><b></b></p>
<p>The hearing committee found respondent violated <span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"><font face='Times New Roman'>Rule </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a>(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, as charged, through his conversion of Mrs. Reed's funds for his own purposes and his failure to provide restitution. It concluded respondent acted intentionally, and caused actual harm.&nbsp; It determined the baseline sanction for such conduct was disbarment.<p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font color="#000000">The committee recognized the presence of several aggravating factors,' but found no mitigating factors. Based on these findings, the committee recommended respondent be disbarred from the practice of law.</font></span></p>
<p><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A8a1d?an=JD_97-DB-076 --##'>Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></p>
<p><span class="BlockText">The disciplinary board concurred in the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee.&nbsp; Relying on the aggravating factors cited by the committee, the disciplinary board recommended respondent be disbarred from the practice of law.&nbsp; Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the recommendation of the disciplinary board.</span></p>
<p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p>The record supports the findings of fact made by the hearing committee.&nbsp; The evidence in the record, including the earlier civil judgment demonstrates respondent knowingly and intentionally converted a significant amount of money from his client, and failed to make any meaningful attempt at restitution. Under the guidelines set forth in <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Assn. v. Hinrichs</i>, 486 So. 2d 116 (La. 1986),<sup>5</sup> </span>disbarment is the appropriate sanction.</p>
<p><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p><span class="BlockText">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, and the record submitted in this matter, it is the judgment of this court that the recommendation of the disciplinary board be adopted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, it is ordered that the name of Charles J. Pisano be stricken from the rolls of attorneys and that his <font face='Times New Roman'>license to practice law</font> in the State of Louisiana<font face='Times New Roman'> be revoked.</font>&nbsp; All costs and expenses of these proceedings are assessed against respondent in accordance with </span></p>
