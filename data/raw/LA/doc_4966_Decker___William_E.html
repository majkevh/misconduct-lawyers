<p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-1550</p>
<p class="headingstyle">IN RE: WILLIAM E. DECKER</p>
<p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by 
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, William E. 
Decker, a suspended attorney.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY BACKGROUND</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in Louisiana 
in 1979. He was suspended by this court for one year and one day in
<span class="cite">In re: Decker, 01-0968 (La. 6/22/01),
<a href="2001-06-22_2001-0968.htm">790 So. 2d 617</a></span> ("Decker I"), for 
neglecting a succession matter, failing to communicate with his client, failing 
to provide an accounting or refund unearned fees, and engaging in conduct 
involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. He has not yet sought 
reinstatement from this suspension.</p>
<h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">In May 1999, Elizabeth Quinn hired respondent to handle her 
husband's succession. She paid respondent a total of $5,500 to complete the 
succession, but he failed to do any work on the matter. For approximately two 
years, Ms. Quinn repeatedly requested status updates from respondent, who 
advised her each time that nothing had been done.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In May 2001, Ms. Quinn sent respondent a certified letter 
requesting an accounting. Respondent failed to respond to this request or refund 
the unearned fees. Thereafter, Ms. Quinn filed a disciplinary complaint against 
respondent with the ODC. He failed to respond to the notice of the complaint. 
Furthermore, respondent failed to notify Ms. Quinn of his suspension imposed in 
Decker I. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent's conduct violated Rules
<span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable diligence 
and promptness in representing a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.5</span> 
(fee arrangements), <span class="allegedrules">1.15</span> (safekeeping property 
of clients or third parties), <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure 
to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation),<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> 
and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving 
dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">On November 3, 2003, the ODC filed one count of formal 
charges against respondent. The formal charges were served upon respondent by 
certified mail. Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal 
charges. Accordingly, the factual allegations contained therein were deemed 
admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme Court 
Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). No formal hearing was held, but the parties were given an 
opportunity to file with the hearing committee written arguments and documentary 
evidence on the issue of sanctions. Respondent filed nothing for the hearing 
committee's consideration.</p>
<h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-11-15_03-DB-074.htm">Hearing 
Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After considering the ODC's submission in response to the 
deemed admitted order, the hearing committee determined that respondent violated 
Rules 1.3, 1.5, 1.15, and 8.4(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. However, 
the committee determined that respondent did not violate Rule 8.1(a) because the 
record contains no evidence that he knowingly made a false statement in 
connection with this disciplinary matter.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The committee further determined that the baseline sanction 
for respondent's misconduct is suspension according to the ABA's Standards for 
Imposing Lawyer Sanctions. The following aggravating factors are present: prior 
disciplinary offenses,<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> multiple 
offenses, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally 
failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, refusal to 
acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, substantial experience in the 
practice of law (admitted 1979), and indifference to making restitution. The 
committee found that no mitigating factors are present.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering the above findings and the standards set forth 
in <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Hinrichs,
<a href="1986-03-31_1984-1459.htm">486 So. 2d 116</a> (La. 1986)</span>, the 
committee recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for 
three years.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the 
hearing committee's recommendation.</p>
<h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2005-06-03_03-DB-074.htm">Disciplinary 
Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing this matter, the disciplinary board 
determined that respondent violated Rules 1.3, 1.5, and 8.4(c) of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct. Respondent failed to take any steps to complete the 
succession of Ms. Quinn's husband. Respondent failed to provide Ms. Quinn with 
the requested accounting or refund the unearned fees. He also misrepresented to 
Ms. Quinn on several occasions that he would complete the succession by a 
certain date and was almost finished when in fact he had not worked on it. The 
board also determined that respondent did not violate Rules 1.15, which it 
stated was inapplicable to this matter, and 8.1(a).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on the above findings, the board determined that 
respondent knowingly violated duties owed to his client, causing her actual harm 
by unduly delaying her husband's succession proceedings. He further harmed her 
by falsely informing her that the succession would be completed by a certain 
date and then failing to complete the work. Finally, he caused harm in that he 
failed to provide an accounting or refund the unearned portion of Ms. Quinn's 
fee.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The board found that the following aggravating factors are 
present: <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary offenses</span>,
<span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>,
<span class="ABAstandard">a pattern of misconduct</span>,
<span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>, 
and <span class="ABAstandard">indifference to making restitution</span>. The 
board also determined that no mitigating factors are present.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The board agreed with the committee that suspension is the 
baseline sanction.&nbsp; The board also determined that case law establishes a 
range of sanctions from a threeyear suspension to disbarment for similar 
misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In recommending an appropriate sanction, the board stated 
the following:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>In the matter at hand, numerous aggravating factors are present, 
	including respondent's prior disciplinary history for similar misconduct. 
	The respondent's conduct also shows an apparent disregard for his 
	professional obligations in this state, as evidenced by his failure to 
	participate in these proceedings and his failure to fulfill his mandatory 
	continuing legal education responsibilities.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3">[3]</a> 
	Accordingly, the Board will deviate upward from the baseline sanction of 
	suspension. . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on this reasoning, the board recommended that 
respondent be disbarred.<br>
The board also recommended respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of<br>
these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the 
disciplinary board's<br>
recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">The deemed admitted facts in this case support a finding 
that respondent violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span>,
<span class="Rules">1.5</span>, <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span>, and
<span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. He took 
$5,500 from Ms. Quinn to complete her husband's succession, then failed to 
perform any work for the next two years. When Ms. Quinn requested an accounting, 
respondent failed to respond. Despite doing no work at all, he also failed to 
refund the $5,500 unearned fee. Furthermore, respondent did not respond to the 
complaint Ms. Quinn filed against him and did not inform her that he was 
suspended from the practice of law. Therefore, the sole issue presented for our 
consideration is the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that 
disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, 
protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future 
misconduct. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis,
<a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The 
discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness 
of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington,
<a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Clearly, respondent violated duties owed to his client, 
which caused delay of the succession and deprived Ms. Quinn of her $5,500. 
Respondent also violated duties owed as a professional by not cooperating with 
the ODC in its investigation or participating in these proceedings. Undoubtedly, 
he acted knowingly, if not intentionally. The baseline sanction for this 
misconduct is a period of suspension. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Several significant aggravating factors are present in the 
instant case, including respondent's prior one year and one day suspension in 
Decker I for nearly identical misconduct.<a name="fnref4" class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> 
Additionally present are a pattern of misconduct, bad faith obstruction of the 
disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders 
of the disciplinary agency, vulnerability of the victim, substantial experience 
in the practice of law, and indifference to making restitution. There are no 
mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering the numerous aggravating factors present, 
respondent's prior suspension, and the $5,500 unearned fee that still has not 
been refunded, we cannot say the board's recommendation of disbarment is 
inappropriate. Accordingly, we will disbar respondent.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the 
hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is 
ordered that William Edwin Decker, Louisiana Bar Roll number 4793, be and he 
hereby is disbarred. His name shall be stricken from the roll of attorneys and 
his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana shall be revoked. 
Respondent is ordered to provide a complete accounting to Elizabeth Quinn and 
refund the unearned portion of the legal fee he was paid in the matter. All 
costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance 
with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days 
from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
<hr>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1">1</a> The ODC 
actually cited Rule 8.1(a) (knowingly making a false statement of material fact 
in connection with a disciplinary matter). However, this appears to be a 
typographical error as the rule was referenced in connection with respondent's 
failure to respond to Ms. Quinn's complaint.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2">2</a> In 
addition to his suspension imposed in Decker I, respondent was admonished by the<br>
disciplinary board in 1998 for neglecting a legal matter.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3">3</a> Respondent 
has been ineligible to practice law since August 3, 2002 for failing to comply<br>
with the mandatory continuing legal education requirements.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4" class="fn" href="#fnref4">4</a> At first 
glance, it could be argued that this case falls under <span class="cite">
Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain, <a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 
So. 2d 470</a> (La. 1991)</span>. However, careful examination indicates that 
although respondent was retained by Ms. Quinn in 1999, which was close in time 
to the 1998 misconduct at issue in Decker I, the bulk of the misconduct in the 
instant case occurred between 2000-2001.</p>
