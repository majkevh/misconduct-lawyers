  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from one count of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, James David Turnage.  Respondent has been disbarred since 2002. 
  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Turnage</i>, 01-2585 (La. 9/13/02), <a href="2002-09-13_2001-2585.htm">826 So. 2d
  546</a></span> ("<i>Turnage I</i>").</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On July 14, 1995, respondent settled Jacqueline Anderson's personal injury claim for the sum of
  $4,036.50.  On July 19, 1995, respondent accounted to Ms. Anderson for the settlement proceeds, deducting the sum of
  $1,382.00 for payment to The Ebrahim Clinic, Ms. Anderson's medical provider.  However, respondent did not forward
  the funds to the medical provider, and instead converted the funds to his own use.  As a result of respondent's
  failure to pay The Ebrahim Clinic, Ms. Anderson's account was turned over to a collection agency.  In April 2000, Ms.
  Anderson filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On April 3, 2002, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent, alleging that his
  conduct in the Anderson matter violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a
  client), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a client),
  <span class="allegedrules">1.15(a)</span>(b)(c) (safekeeping property of clients or third persons),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct), and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or
  misrepresentation).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges. Accordingly, the factual
  allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3).  No formal hearing was held, but the parties were given an opportunity to file with the
  hearing committee written arguments and documentary evidence on the issue of sanctions.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2003-07-07_02-DB-033.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">After consideration of the ODC's submission in response to the deemed admitted
  order,<a name="_ftnref1" class="fn" href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> the hearing committee found respondent
  violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.  Respondent converted funds belonging to
  Ms. Anderson and earmarked for The Ebrahim Clinic, falsely communicated to his client that he was going to pay the
  funds to The Ebrahim Clinic, and failed to communicate with his client and return the funds.  Based on these
  findings, the committee determined that respondent knowingly and intentionally violated multiple duties that he owed
  to Ms. Anderson.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The committee found no mitigating factors in this case, but determined the following aggravating
  factors are present: <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary offenses</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">a pattern of
  misconduct</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">indifference to making restitution</span>. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Under these circumstances, the committee recommended respondent be disbarred.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-01-30_02-DB-033.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">After reviewing this matter, the disciplinary board found that the deemed admitted facts support
  the conclusion that respondent failed to promptly and diligently complete his client's legal matter by paying a
  third-party medical provider with funds retained for that purpose, in violation of Rule
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span>; failed to provide his client with reasonable information about the status of the
  legal matter after the settlement funds were disbursed, in violation of Rule <span class="Rules">1.4</span>; failed
  to promptly deliver funds to a third-party medical provider, in violation of Rule <span class="Rules">1.15(b)</span>;
  and misrepresented to his client that he was going to use the $1,382.00 withheld from the settlement proceeds to pay
  the third-party medical provider, in violation of Rules <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span>.  However, the board concluded that the deemed admitted facts do not support a
  finding that respondent commingled property of his client or third persons in violation of Rules 1.15(a) and 1.15(c),
  as charged in the formal charges.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The board determined respondent violated duties owed to his client, Ms. Anderson, and that his
  conduct was knowing, if not intentional.  Actual harm to Ms. Anderson is present in that her credit report, rating
  and history were adversely affected by the failure of respondent to pay her medical provider.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The board adopted the aggravating factors found by the hearing committee, and agreed that no
  mitigating factors are present.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Turning to the issue of an appropriate sanction, the board determined that respondent's
  misconduct in this matter warrants disbarment; however, the board noted that the misconduct occurred in the same time
  frame as the misconduct at issue in <i>Turnage I</i>.<a name="_ftnref2" class="fn" href="#_ftn2"
  id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Accordingly, citing <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain</i>,
  <a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 So. 2d 470</a> (La. 1991)</span>, the board recommended that respondent be
  adjudged guilty of additional violations warranting disbarment, to be considered in the event he makes a future
  application for readmission.  Additionally, the board recommended that respondent be ordered to make restitution in
  the amount of $1,382.00 plus interest to The Ebrahim Clinic or to his client, Jacqueline C. Anderson, if the debt to
  the clinic has been satisfied.  Finally, the board recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and
  expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of the
  court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The deemed admitted facts in this case establish that respondent failed to promptly deliver funds
  to a third-party medical provider that were withheld for that purpose from his client's personal injury settlement. 
  Therefore, the sole issue presented for our consideration is the appropriate sanction for respondent's
  misconduct. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain
  high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future
  misconduct.  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So.
  2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.  The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness
  of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. 
  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d
  520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As the disciplinary board observed, the substantive misconduct at issue in this case occurred in
  the same time frame as the misconduct forming the basis of respondent's disbarment in <i>Turnage I</i>.  In
  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain</i>, <a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 So. 2d
  470</a> (La. 1991)</span>, we observed that when the underlying conduct occurs within the same period as the
  misconduct forming the basis of a previous disbarment, the discipline imposed should be determined as if both
  proceedings were before the court simultaneously.  Applying this procedure in <i>Chatelain</i>, we declined to extend
  the minimum period for readmission.  Instead, we adjudged the respondent guilty of additional violations warranting
  disbarment which were added to his record for consideration in the event he applied for readmission after becoming
  eligible to do so.  <i>See also</i> <span class="cite"><i>In re: Patrick</i>, 01-1419 (La. 3/15/02),
  <a href="2002-03-15_2001-1419.htm">815 So. 2d 804</a></span>; <span class="cite"><i>In re: Gros</i>, 98-0772 (La.
  3/15/02), <a href="2002-03-15_1998-0772.htm">815 So. 2d 799</a></span>; <span class="cite"><i>In re: Parker</i>,
  00-3532 (La. 3/15/02), <a href="2002-03-15_2001-3532.htm">815 So. 2d 794</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction in the instant case, we believe the approach of
  <i>Chatelain</i> is instructive.  Accordingly, our determination of a sanction will be based upon the appropriate
  sanction we would have imposed if these charges had been before the court at the same time as the charges in
  respondent's previous disciplinary proceeding.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Had the instant charges been filed simultaneously with those charges forming the basis of
  respondent's earlier disbarment, they would have only reinforced our view that respondent lacks the moral fitness to
  practice law and must be disbarred, both as a sanction for his misconduct and to protect the public.  Therefore, as
  in <i>Chatelain</i>, we will adjudge respondent guilty of additional violations which warrant disbarment and which
  will be added to his record for consideration in the event he applies for readmission after becoming eligible to do
  so.  We further emphasize that although respondent may have a procedural right to apply for readmission, this court
  retains absolute discretion to grant or deny such an application.  In light of respondent's lengthy history of
  egregious misconduct, this court will carefully scrutinize any application for readmission with a critical eye.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that James David Turnage be adjudged guilty of additional violations which
  warrant disbarment and which may be considered in the event he applies for readmission from his disbarment in <i>In
  re: Turnage</i>, 01-2585 (La. 9/13/02), <a href="2002-09-13_2001-2585.htm">826 So. 2d 546</a>, after becoming
  eligible to do so.  It is further ordered that respondent shall pay restitution to The Ebrahim Clinic in the amount
  of $1,382.00 plus legal interest, or to Jacqueline C. Anderson if she has satisfied the debt to The Ebrahim Clinic. 
  All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
  10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn2" class="fn" href="#_ftnref2" id="_ftn2">[2]</a> The misconduct at issue in
  <i>Turnage I</i> occurred between June 1996 and August 1999, while the misconduct in the instant matter commenced in
  July 1995 and continued at least through the filing of the complaint in April 2000.</p>
