  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary matter involves a Petition for Consent Discipline by J. Courtney
  Wilson ("Respondent") of New Orleans. The matter arises out of two complaints filed against the Respondent for his
  alleged failure to act with reasonable diligence in representing two clients. The Respondent tendered a conditional
  admission to the misconduct in exchange for discipline in the form of a public reprimand. The Board accepts the
  admission and the stated form of discipline.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On April 18, 2002, Respondent filed a Petition for Consent Discipline, an Affidavit of Consent
  and Waiver of Opportunity to Withdraw. Together, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") and the Respondent filed
  Stipulated Facts. ODC filed a Memorandum of Law and a Concurrence. No Formal Charges were filed.</p>

  <h2>STIPULATED FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent stipulated to the following facts:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Respondent was hired to represent Jodith Savoie in an EEOC case. The Respondent failed to respond on behalf of
    this client within the 15-day period set forth by 29 C.F.R. 1614.107(g). As a result, the client's claim was
    dismissed.</p>

    <p>Respondent was hired to file a habeas corpus petition on behalf of Kelvin Ray Smith. After the court denied the
    petition, the Respondent failed to file a timely objection within the 10-day period set by Rule 72(b) FRCP.
    <a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Respondent and ODC seek the imposition of discipline by consent pursuant to Rule XIX, Section
  20, of the Rules of the Louisiana Supreme Court asserting that investigations of the matters, as set forth above, are
  pending and that ODC and the Respondent have jointly agreed that the Respondent violated Rule
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span><a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> of the Rules of Professional Conduct and should
  submit to discipline in the form of a public reprimand. The parties also agree that the mitigating factors of absence
  of a dishonest or selfish motive and cooperative attitude toward the proceedings are present.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Because the parties agree that the Respondent violated Rule <span class="Rules">1.3</span> of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct, the Board accepts the stipulated rule violation. <span class="CITE"><i>In re
  Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96); <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So.2d 272</a>.</span> Given the
  violation, the Board is left to determine if the proposed sanction is appropriate. Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX,
  Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall
  consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the
      profession;</li>

      <li>whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</li>

      <li>the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</li>

      <li>the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court also relies on the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions
  ("ABA Standards") to determine the baseline sanction. <span class="CITE"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94);
  <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">636 So.2d 343</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In violating Rule 1.3, the Respondent violated duties owed to his clients. Based upon the
  assertions of ODC in its Memorandum of Law,<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> the Board finds that the Respondent acted
  negligently. While the record does not contain specific information as to the harm caused, the Board finds that
  actual harm did occur inasmuch as the Respondent failed to timely file a response resulting in the dismissal of the
  EEOC claim of Ms. Savoie and failed to file an objection to the denial of the habeas corpus petition on behalf of Mr.
  Smith.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A.B.A. Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span> provides that public reprimand is the
  appropriate baseline sanction when a lawyer is negligent and fails to act with reasonable diligence in representing a
  client, and causes injury or potential injury to a client.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board recognizes the following mitigating factors, as stipulated: absence of a dishonest or
  selfish motive and a cooperative attitude toward these proceedings. The Board also finds the aggravating factors of
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>,<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a>
  <span class="ABAstandard">prior discipline</span><a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> and
  <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The stipulated sanction is appropriate considering the case law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board accepted a Petition for Consent Discipline and imposed a public reprimand in
  <span class="CITE"><i>In Re Burks</i>, <a href="2001-05-31_00-DB-125.htm">00-DB-125</a> (5/31/01)</span>. Burks
  involved the respondent's initial failure to cooperate with ODC, his lack of diligence and his failure to communicate
  with his client. Mr. Burks agreed to represent a client in a medical malpractice matter but failed to convene a
  medical review panel prior to his client's death. He admitted his lack of diligence. Finding aggravating factors of
  prior disciplinary offenses and substantial experience in the practice of law and mitigating factors of absence of a
  dishonest motive, remorse and good faith effort to rectify the consequences of misconduct, the Board determined that
  the agreed upon discipline was appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <span class="CITE"><i>In re Laiche</i>, <a href="1999-07-15_98-DB-057.htm">98-DB-056</a>
  (7/15/99)</span>, formal charges were brought against an attorney alleging that he filed suit on behalf of his
  clients in a personal injury matter but did little more to move the case forward over the next eight years. It was
  also alleged that Mr. Laiche failed to keep his clients informed as to the progress of the case, failed to timely
  inform his clients of a settlement offer, failed to return a file and failed to timely sign and forward a motion to
  substitute counsel. One aggravating factor existed: substantial experience in the practice of law. Mitigating factors
  included the absence of a disciplinary record, no dishonest or selfish motive and a timely good faith effort to
  rectify the misconduct were present. The Board accepted the petition for consent discipline, ordered that the
  respondent be publicly reprimanded and be charged with all costs and expenses of the proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <span class="CITE"><i>In re Jordan</i>, <a href="2000-10-24_99-DB-094.htm">99-DB-094</a>
  (10/24/00)</span>, two complaints were filed against Mr. Jordan. One complaint was based on Mr. Jordan's failure to
  file a Judgment of Divorce in his client's domestic proceeding even though both counsel had signed it. The
  complainant had great difficulty in contacting the Respondent and was required to retain another attorney to complete
  the representation. Respondent was also engaged to accomplish a name change for his client, and although he served
  the necessary pleadings on the District Attorney, he failed to obtain a signed judgment for several months.
  Considering aggravating factors of substantial experience in the practice of law and multiple offenses and
  recognizing no prior discipline, the Board accepted the Petition for Consent Discipline.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the Petition for Consent Discipline, the factors set forth in <span>Louisiana Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C)</span>, the ABA Standards, the aggravating and mitigating factors and the relevant case
  law, public reprimand is an appropriate sanction.</p>

  <h2>RECOMMENDATION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the foregoing, it is ordered that the Petition for Consent Discipline, admission and
  the stated form of discipline be accepted, and that a public reprimand be issued against J. Courtney Wilson.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">It is further ordered that Respondent be assessed the costs and expenses of these
  proceedings.</p>
