  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="" id="_ednref1" class="fn">*</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary proceeding arises from one count of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Pierre F. Gaudin, Jr., an attorney licensed to practice law in
  Louisiana but currently on interim suspension.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="" id="_ednref2"
  class="fn">1</a></p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On April 8, 1999, respondent was charged by bill of information in the United States District
  Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana with one count of making and subscribing a false tax return, a felony, in
  violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7206(1).<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="" id="_ednref3" class="fn">2</a>  On May 12,
  1999, respondent entered a plea of guilty to the charge. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The factual basis accompanying the plea indicated that if the matter had proceeded to trial, the
  government would have proven that respondent filed a 1992 tax return dated April 14, 1993, which reported Schedule C
  gross receipts of $16,921. The government indicated that during the relevant period, respondent worked as a contract
  attorney for his father's law firm, Gaudin &amp; Gaudin.  During 1992, checks made payable to respondent and to
  "cash" totaling $32,982 were drawn on the firm's business accounts and were deposited into respondent's personal
  accounts.  Another $31,443 in checks, mostly payable to "cash," were drawn on the firm's business accounts but were
  not deposited into respondent's personal accounts.  In addition, the government indicated that current and former
  employees of Gaudin &amp; Gaudin would testify that they endorsed and negotiated checks made payable to "cash" that
  were provided to them by respondent, and that they returned the cash to him.  Checks cashed in this manner totaled
  $17,865 during 1992.  The government further indicated that it would provide the testimony of an expert witness from
  the Internal Revenue Service, who would testify respondent received a total of $82,290 from his work as a contract
  attorney for Gaudin &amp; Gaudin which should have been reported as Schedule C gross receipts.  Finally, the
  government indicated it would produce evidence that respondent submitted an amended return for the 1992 tax year,
  dated July 4, 1998, on which he reported Schedule C gross receipts of $87,650.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The district court accepted respondent's guilty plea on May 12, 1999.  On August 4, 1999,
  respondent was placed on supervised probation for a period of five years and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine.  On
  August 9, 1999, respondent was suspended from practice before the United States District Court for the Eastern
  District of Louisiana based on his conviction.  On October 8, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
  Circuit likewise suspended respondent from the practice of law in that court.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After respondent entered his guilty plea, the ODC filed a motion in this court, seeking to place
  respondent on interim suspension pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 19(C).  On February 2, 2000, we ordered that
  respondent be suspended from the practice of law on an interim basis, and ordered that necessary disciplinary
  proceedings be commenced.  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Gaudin</i>, 99-3147 (La. 2/2/00), 759 So. 2d 758</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Thereafter, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent, alleging that he was
  convicted of a serious crime, which adversely reflects upon his moral fitness to practice law, in violation of Rule
  8.4(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent subsequently answered the formal charges and denied that the
  crime of which he was convicted is a serious crime, which adversely reflects upon his moral fitness to practice
  law.</p>

  <h3>Formal Hearing</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">At the formal hearing, the ODC called no witnesses, but introduced the record of respondent's
  underlying federal criminal conviction, including the bill of information, the factual basis for respondent's guilty
  plea, and the judgment and probation/commitment order.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent testified on his own behalf.  According to respondent, out of the $32,982 in Gaudin
  &amp; Gaudin funds he deposited in his personal account in 1992, only $16,921 represented income.<a href="#_edn4"
  name="_ednref4" title="" id="_ednref4" class="fn">3</a>  Respondent testified the remaining $16,061 deposited into
  his personal checking account represented reimbursement for law firm related business expenses (i.e., travel, dining,
  etc.). According to respondent, he never received any tax documents from Gaudin &amp; Gaudin while employed there,
  but instead calculated his income based on his own bank records and a handwritten list of business expenses he kept
  on a legal pad.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As to the remaining $49,308 of unreported income, which consisted of checks payable to "cash"
  drawn by respondent on the law firm's accounts, respondent admitted that he endorsed these checks personally or had
  an office staffer endorse and cash them at his direction.  However, respondent denied ever using the funds for his
  personal use.  Rather, he stated that, when he received the cash, he gave it to the office manager, Kenneth Villane,
  who used it to provide monetary medical reimbursements and living expenses, prior to settlement, to the firm's
  personal injury clients.  Respondent claimed the firm had to provide expenses to these clients in cash because the
  clients, who lacked driver's licenses or other means of identification, were unable to cash checks at a banking
  institution.  Respondent admitted there was no record of the clients to which these funds were given, due to the
  firm's lack of proper bookkeeping procedures.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">According to respondent, he did not learn this $49,308 was attributed as income to him until
  1997, after the Internal Revenue Service conducted an audit of his father, Pierre Gaudin, Sr.  In connection with the
  audit, Mr. Villane prepared 1099 forms for the entire office staff, purportedly with the intent of lowering the tax
  liability of respondent's father. At some point during the audit, allegedly unbeknownst to respondent and his father,
  Mr. Villane provided the Internal Revenue Service with the 1099 forms, one of which indicated respondent had been
  paid substantially more than respondent had reported on his personal return.  Respondent asserted that he never
  received the 1099 form from Mr. Villane, possibly because Mr. Villane died shortly after preparing it.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent conceded that he pled guilty to the subsequent tax charges.  However, he insisted he
  was not guilty, and testified he pled guilty only because he was embarrassed, confused and sought to protect his
  reputation and that of his family.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a   href="../HC/2000-03-28_99-DB-100.htm">Hearing Committee
  Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee concluded respondent violated the professional rules as charged, but the
  injury to the public or the administration of justice was minor.  Relying on the presence of several mitigating
  factors and jurisprudence from this court, the committee concluded a one-year suspension, with credit for time served
  under the interim suspension and with all remaining time deferred, subject to a one-year period of supervised
  probation with conditions, to be an appropriate sanction.  The ODC objected to the hearing committee's
  recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a   href="../DB/2000-10-25_99-DB-100.htm">Disciplinary Board
  Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board determined respondent violated the professional rules as charged, and,
  unlike the committee, concluded there was actual injury, albeit minimal, to the public fisc, and injury to the
  reputation of the legal profession.  It concluded respondent's conduct was negligent "to the point that he should
  have known it was wrong, even if unintentional."  Agreeing with the ODC, the board found the hearing committee erred
  in failing to find respondent neglected to take reasonable steps to keep track of the financial aspects of his law
  practice.  Moreover, the board found respondent's reliance on others in the law office to handle his financial
  affairs was an insufficient excuse for his negligent conduct.  As evidence, it noted respondent was unable to
  properly account for over $65,000 in client advances and other office expenses, which was to the detriment of the
  bottom line of the law office, with no explanation other than that measures were not taken to post the expenses to
  clients' accounts.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Addressing the issue of sanctions, the board recognized several mitigating factors, namely
  absence of prior discipline, full and free disclosure and cooperation in the disciplinary process, good character and
  reputation, imposition of other penalties and sanctions (criminal sentence, over $40,000 in monetary consequences,
  and this court's interim suspension order), and remorse. Applying the recent case of <span class="cite"><i>In re:
  Pardue,</i> 98-3017 (La. 3/26/99), <a href="1999-03-26_1998-3017.htm">731 So. 2d 224</a></span>, the board
  recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of eighteen months, with six months
  deferred and with credit for time served on his interim suspension.  It further recommended respondent be placed on
  supervised probation for a period of one year with conditions.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the recommendation of the
  disciplinary board.  However, this court ordered briefing and oral argument in the matter in accordance with Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, § 11(G)(1)(a).</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's primary defense, both before the hearing committee and disciplinary board and in
  this court, has been to assert he is not guilty of the crime of which he was convicted.  Insofar as the hearing
  committee and disciplinary board entertained this argument and sought to revisit the facts of respondent's
  conviction, they fell into error.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">It is well settled that when an attorney has been convicted of a crime, the sole issue to be
  decided in a subsequent disciplinary proceeding is whether the crime warrants discipline, and if so, the extent
  thereof.  Supreme Court Rule XIX, § <a href="#!--%20#LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME%20--#?f=id&amp;id=r19s19">19</a>(E). While the
  court may consider the circumstances of the offense, as well as any aggravating and mitigating circumstances, in
  determining the extent to which the crime warrants discipline, a respondent may not argue facts which are
  inconsistent with the essential elements of the crime of which he was convicted.  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana
  State Bar Ass'n v. Wilkinson</i>, <a href="1990-06-04_1989-2016.htm">562 So. 2d 902</a> (La. 1990)</span>. Simply
  put, a respondent cannot seek to try again the issue of guilt after he has been convicted. 
  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. O'Halloran</i>, <a href="1982-01-08_1980-1973.htm">412 So. 2d
  523</a> (La. 1982)</span>.  Therefore, despite respondent's assertion that he is in fact not guilty of willfully
  making and filing a false tax return under 26 U.S.C. § 7206(1), his guilty plea is conclusive evidence of a violation
  of that statute for the purpose of these disciplinary proceedings.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""
  id="_ednref5" class="fn">4</a> </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">We have held that a violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7206(1) is a serious crime for purposes of Rule 8.4
  of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  <i>Pardue</i>, 731 So. 2d at 227.  The crime of willfully making and filing a
  false tax return evidences moral turpitude, although it is generally not considered as serious as the crime of tax
  evasion.  Compare <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Ponder</i>, <a href="1972-11-06_52373.htm">340
  So. 2d 143</a> (La. 1976)</span>, with <i>O'Halloran</i>, <i>supra</i>.  Nonetheless, the baseline sanction for a
  conviction involving dishonesty, which would include a violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7206(1), is a suspension from the
  practice of law for a period of at least two to three years.  <i>See</i> <span class="cite"><i>In re: Huddleston</i>,
  <a href="1992-03-02_1991-2029.htm">595 So. 2d 1141</a>, 1147 (La. 1992)</span>; see also <i>Pardue</i>,
  <i>supra</i>.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="" id="_ednref6" class="fn">5</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The record reveals the existence of several mitigating factors in this case, including
  respondent's lack of a prior disciplinary record, his good character and reputation, and his full and free disclosure
  both to the government and to the disciplinary authorities.  We further note that respondent's misconduct does not
  involve the breach of any duties to clients, nor did it cause any damage to clients.  We do not identify any
  aggravating circumstances from the record.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these factors, we conclude some deviation from the baseline sanction of a two-year to
  three-year suspension is justified.  Accordingly, we will suspend respondent from the practice of law for a period of
  eighteen months, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension. </p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is ordered that Pierre F. Gaudin, Jr. be suspended from the
  practice of law in Louisiana for a period of eighteen months, retroactive to February 2, 2000, the date of his
  interim suspension.  All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of the finality of this court's
  judgment until paid.</p>

  factors which should be considered, such as his health problems and those of his wife.  By contrast, respondent in
  the instant case has consistently refused to acknowledge his guilt.  Rather than setting forth mitigating factors,
  respondent seeks to retry his criminal conviction by asserting his innocence.  Such an argument is clearly
  impermissible under our court's jurisprudence. </p>

  longer sanctions in disciplinary cases arising from felony violations of the tax laws.  Indeed, with respect to
