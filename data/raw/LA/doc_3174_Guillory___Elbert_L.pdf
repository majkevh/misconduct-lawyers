  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 01-DB-047</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary
  Counsel (herein "ODC") against Elbert L. Guillory (herein "Respondent") of Opelousas, Louisiana. This matter came
  before the Board on stipulated facts involving the failure to provide competent representation, a false statement and
  the failure to report a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The Board affirms the Hearing Committee's
  recommendation of a public reprimand.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On May 10, 2001, ODC filed formal charges against Respondent. On May 29, 2001, Respondent,
  through his attorney Leslie J. Schiff, answered the formal charges by stating that he "maintained contact with his
  clients through those individuals [Leo Paul Caillier, Sr. and Larry Joseph Caillier]. His contact with the other
  heirs was limited, but at all times he reasonably believes that Leo Paul Caillier, Sr. and Larry Joseph Caillier were
  acting for the other Caillier heirs and with their knowledge and permission." Respondent admits that an Act of
  Exchange, involving real property, was not signed by all the owners in his presence as notary of the document.
  Respondent requested a hearing in mitigation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On July 31, 2001, Respondent and ODC filed a Joint Stipulation of Facts. A hearing was set for
  August 9, 2001, but Respondent, with ODC's consent, moved to continue the hearing. The hearing was continued to
  October 18, 2001, but ODC, with Respondent's consent, moved to continue the hearing. A hearing in mitigation was
  conducted before Hearing Committee No. 6 (herein the "Committee") on November 15, 2001. Respondent testified and
  documentary evidence was submitted by both parties. The Committee requested post-hearing memoranda from the parties
  on the issue of sanctions. ODC asserted the baseline sanction was between a public reprimand and suspension. ODC
  recommended a short suspension, deferred, in light of other penalties ($2,000 civil suit settlement) and no dishonest
  or selfish motive. Respondent recommended a public reprimand in light of his remorse, cooperation, public service
  based practice and numerous community contributions and awards.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Committee filed its report on April 8, 2002, and recommended Respondent be publicly
  reprimanded. ODC filed a Notice of Objection noting its disagreement with the following Committee findings: (1) ODC
  had abandoned its claim of Respondent's failure to notify all heirs of the succession proceeding; (2) Respondent
  "reasonably" believed all the signatures on the document were genuine; and (3) Respondent made a timely good faith
  effort to correct his misconduct. But for this list of objections, ODC offered no further support of its position.
  Respondent filed a Response to Notice of Objection arguing that ODC provided no evidence of failure to notify the
  heirs of the succession, that Respondent's belief regarding the signatures was anything but reasonable or that
  Respondent failed to act to correct his misconduct. Panel "C" heard this matter on July 11, 2002.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES <a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></h2>

  <blockquote>
    <div id="fc01-DB-047">
      <p>You previously represented the succession of Ethel LeBlanc Caillier, during which time you obtained a Judgment
      of Possession. You failed to notify all of the heirs of the pendancy [sic] of the proceedings or of the judgment.
      On or about May 19, 1999, in your capacity of Notary Public, you passed an Act of Exchange between Leo Paul
      Caillier and Deanna Caillier Mercer, etal [sic], concerning immovable property that was the subject of the
      succession. The documents were signed by Leo Paul Caillier (by mark) and by Larry Joseph Caillier in you
      presence; however, you did not require the other signatories to appear before you and the witnesses. The papers
      were then delivered to Deanna Caillier Mercer to obtain the signatures of the other heirs. Larry Joseph Caillier
      returned the signed papers to you. You notarized the instrument and recorded it with the Clerk of Court of
      Lafayette Parish, file number 99-020395.</p>

      <p>The signatures of Leo Caillier, Jr., Eva Dell Caillier Senigal, Laura Caillier Lewis, Marlanae Adams Linden,
      and Lisa Adams Dunn were affixed to the Act of Exchange without their knowledge or consent. Beverly Caillier
      signed the Act of Exchange, but she did so outside of your presence.</p>

      <p>You failed to provide competent representation to client, knowingly made a false statement or material fact or
      law to a third person, failed to report professional misconduct, engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,
      deceit and misrepresentation, and engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. You conduct

  <h2>JOINT STIPULATION OF FACTS <a class="fn" href="#fn7">7</a></h2>

  <blockquote>
    <h3>1.</h3>

    <p>Elbert Lee Guillory was admitted to the Bar of this state on October 10, 1986. He is a sole practitioner in
    Opelousas, Louisiana, and at all pertinent times a notary public.</p>

    <h3>2.</h3>

    <p>Leo Paul Caillier and Ethel LeBlanc Caillier were the parents of 13 children, to wit:</p>

    <p>Larry Joseph Caillier<br />
     Deanna Caillier Mercer<br />
     Russell Paul Caillier<br />
     Leo P. Caillier, Jr.<br />
     Leola P. Caillier<br />
     Eva Dell Caillier Senigal<br />
     Laura Caillier Lewis<br />
     Beverly Caillier Cormier<br />
     Priscilla Caillier Bowman<br />
     Tommy Caillier<br />
     Edoline Caillier Phillips<br />
     Ethel Lee Caillier Nichols<br />
     Deceased Daughter Adams</p>

    <h3>3.</h3>

    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Caillier owned two undivided pieces of property located in the Parish of Lafayette.</p>

    <h3>4.</h3>

    <p>Ethel LeBlanc Caillier died in testate on or about November 30, 1991. Respondent's services were retained in the
    matter of succession. He obtained a judgment of possession that recognized Leo Paul Caillier as the surviving
    spouse in community, and owner of an undivided one-half of the above referenced properties. The 12 surviving
    children and two grandchildren, by representation, were placed in possession of an undivided one-half interest in
    the same properties.</p>

    <h3>5.</h3>

    <p>In early 1999, Mr. Guillory prepared an Act of Exchange pursuant to a proposed sale of property. By the terms of
    the Act of Exchange Leo Paul Caillier would give his 13 children his one-half ownership interest in the two pieces
    of property, in exchange, the children would give back to their father a small portion of the property. Respondent
    delivered the unexecuted document to Larry Joseph Caillier and Deanna Caillier Mercer. Either Larry Joseph Caillier
    or Deanna Caillier Mercer signed their father's name pursuant to a power of attorney. The document was later
    returned to the respondent with all of his signatures affixed thereto.</p>

    <h3>6.</h3>

    <p>Several of the parties, including Leo Caillier, Jr., Eva Dell Caillier Senigal, Laura Caillier Lewis, Marlanae
    Adams Linden, and Lisa Adams Dunn, did not sign the Act of Exchange and did not have prior knowledge of or give
    prior consent to the transaction. Larry Joseph Caillier, Deanna Caillier Mercer, Russell Paul Caillier, Beverly
    Caillier Cormier, Priscilla Caillier Bowman, Tommy Caillier, and Edoline Caillier Phillips signed the Act Of [sic]
    Exchange on their own behalf, but did not sign in Respondent's presence.</p>

    <h3>7.</h3>

    <p>Respondent notarized the Act of Exchange as purportedly an authentic act, and on May 18, 1999, recorded it in
    the public records of the Parish of Lafayette.</p>

    <h3>8.</h3>

    <p>By an Act of Sale executed on May 21, 1999, Leo Paul Caillier, through Larry Joseph Caillier and Deanna Caillier
    Mercer, conveyed the property he received in the Act of Exchange to Bitt Investments, L.L.C., with full warranty of
    title. Respondent endorsed the check payable to Leo Paul Caillier and deposited the sale proceeds of $165,000.000
    $147,613.40 [followed by initials "EG"].</p>

    <h3>9.</h3>

    <p>On or about May 5, 2000, Leo Caillier, Jr. initiated a civil action entitled Leo Caillier, Jr. v. Larry Joseph
    Caillier, Deanna Caillier Mercer, Bitt Investments, L.L.C., and Elbert Lee Guillory largely based on the facts as
    stated herein. The matter is pending in the 15th Judicial District Court, docket number 20002484-K. Respondent may
    be responsible for damages suffered by Leo Caillier, Jr.</p>

    <h3>10.</h3>

    <p>On October 1, 2000, the chairperson of Hearing Committee #33 approved the filing of formal charges in Office Of
    [sic] Disciplinary Counsel file number 0010219. The alleged misconduct includes notarizing a document containing
    signatures of several persons, some of whom did not appear in person before the attorney notarizing the document.
    This conduct violated the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

    <h3>11.</h3>

    <p>There are no additional material issues of fact raised by the formal charges filed herein.</p>

  <h2><a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=01-DB-047.HC$t=document-frameset.htm" >FINDINGS OF THE HEARING
  COMMITTEE</a></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Committee accepted Respondent's and ODC's Joint Stipulation of Facts and found Respondent had
  violated Rules 1.1(a), 4.1(a), 8.3(a) and 8.4(a) and (c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct <a class="fn"
  href="#fn8">8</a>. H.C. Rpt. p. 5. The Committee found no evidence of Respondent having failed to notify all the
  heirs of the succession proceeding and recommended this part of the formal charges be dismissed. H.C. Rpt. p. 3.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Committee accepted Respondent's admission that some of the signatures on the Act of Exchange
  were not placed on the document in his presence. After hearing Respondent's testimony, the Committee was convinced
  that Respondent had the "good faith belief that the entire family was on board and that all signatures were genuine.
  He signed the document as Notary out of the presence of some of the signatories as a convenience to them and in the
  honest belief that he was assisting them and not causing them harm." H.C. Rpt. pp. 4-5. The Committee determined that
  Respondent "got caught in the crossfire of heirs who, a year or so after the fact, began battling over the sale of
  family property or distribution of the proceeds thereof. Remarkably, the Respondent refuses to place blame on anyone
  but himself. He sincerely and humbly admits his mistake." H.C. Rpt. p.5.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Committee recognized the following mitigating factors: (1) absence of dishonest or selfish
  motive; (2) timely good faith effort to make restitution ($2,000) and rectify his misconduct by admitting his error
  and participating in mediation; (3) full and free disclosure and cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary
  proceeding; (4) character or reputation<a class="fn" href="#fn9">9</a> ; and remorse. The Committee found the
  aggravating factors of substantial experience in the practice of law<a class="fn" href="#fn10">10</a> and prior
  misconduct <a class="fn" href="#fn11">11</a>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Committee relied upon <span class="CITE"><i>In re Andre P. Gauthier</i>, <a 
  href="2001-06-21_00-DB-081.htm">00-DB-081</a> (Board Op. 6/21/01)</span> and <span class="CITE"><i>In re C. Kenneth
  Deshotel</i>, <a  href="1999-04-08_97-DB-063.htm">97-DB-063</a> (Board Op. 1999)</span> for their
  similarities to the instant case. In <i>Gauthier</i>, respondent notarized a mortgage where none of the signatories
  appeared before him. The Board found the presence of mitigating factors, similar to the ones present in the instant
  matter, and concluded a public reprimand with certain conditions was the appropriate sanction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <i>Deshotel</i>, the Board ordered a public reprimand for an attorney who prepared and
  backdated a marriage contract to a date prior to the signatories' marriage even though the respondent knew that a
  post-nuptial execution of a marriage contract without court authority was null. The Board found respondent was
  "motivated by a sincere, although misguided, affection and loyalty to his client who insisted (begged) that he help
  her execute the document." H.C. Rpt. p. 8.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Committee acknowledged that ODC and Respondent cited other cases<a class="fn"
  href="#fn12">12</a> in which harsher sanctions were imposed, but the Committee found the cases were inapposite
  because they involved the specific intent to deceive or defraud coupled with an active and knowing participation by
  the attorney. H.C. Rpt. p. 9.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon the stipulated facts, Respondent's testimony, mitigating and aggravating factors and
  case law, the Committee recommended a public reprimand.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <h3>I. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The powers and duties of the Disciplinary Board are defined in Section 2 of the Louisiana Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement. Subsection (G)(2)(a) states that the Board is "to perform
  appellate review functions, consisting of review of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of
  hearing committees with respect to formal charges . . . and prepare and forward to the court its own findings, if
  any, and recommendations."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In as much as the Board is serving in an appellate capacity, the standard of review applied to
  findings of fact is that of "manifest error". <span class="CITE"><i>Arceneaux v. Domingue</i>, 365 So.2d 1330
  (La.1978);</span> <span class="CITE"><i>Rosell v. Esco</i>, 549 So.2d 840 (La. 1989)</span>. The Board conducts a de
  novo review of the hearing committee's application of the Rules of Professional Conduct. <i>In re Hill</i>,
  <a  href="1992-01-22_90-DB-004.htm">90-DB-004</a>.</p>

  <h3>II. THE MANIFEST ERROR INQUIRY</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A manifest error inquiry in not performed when the parties jointly stipulate to the facts. The
  Respondent's answer to the formal charges, the documents submitted into evidence and Respondent's testimony support
  the stipulated facts. There is nothing to suggest that the Committee strayed from the stipulated facts.</p>

  <h3>III. DE NOVO REVIEW OF THE APPLICATION OF THE RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the record in this matter, the Board finds the following violations of the Rules
  of Professional Conduct:</p>

  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
    <li>Respondent has violated Rule <span class="Rules">1.1(a)</span> (provide competent representation) by failing to
    follow the procedures in notarizing the Act of Exchange.</li>

    <li>Respondent has violated Rule <span class="Rules">4.1(a)</span> (false statement of material fact to a third
    person) by filing into the public records a document that he assured was fully executed in his presence.</li>

    <li>Respondent has not violated Rule <span class="Rules">4.1(b)</span>. There has been no showing that Respondent
    knowingly assisted a client in a criminal or fraudulent act.</li>

    <li>Respondent has not violated Rule <span class="Rules">4.3</span>. ODC has not proven that any party to the Act
    of Exchange was misled by Respondent.</li>

    <li>Respondent has violated Rule <span class="Rules">8.3(a)</span> by failing to self report to ODC his failure to
    properly notarize the Act of Exchange.</li>

    <li>Respondent has violated Rules <span class="Rules">8.4(a) and (c)</span> by violating the Rules of Professional
    Conduct and by misrepresenting the accuracy of the execution of a notarized document.</li>

    <li>Respondent has not violated Rule 8.4(d). ODC did not establish that Respondent's conduct prejudiced the
    administration of justice.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In imposing a sanction after a finding of lawyer misconduct, the Supreme Court requires the Board
  to consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the
      profession;</li>

      <li>whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</li>

      <li>the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</li>

      <li>the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.<br />
      <br />
       La. Sp. Ct. R. XIX, §10(C).</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent has violated duties owed to his clients, the public and the legal system. Respondent's
  conduct is both knowing and negligent in failing to execute his duties as notary by relying on a client to obtain the
  signatures he was required to do personally. The record supports the following mitigating factors: 9.32(b)
  <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest or selfish motive</span>; 9.32(d) <span class="ABAstandard">timely
  good faith effort to make restitution</span> of $2,000; 9.32(e) <span class="ABAstandard">full and free disclosure to
  the disciplinary board and cooperative attitude toward the proceedings</span>; 9.32(g)
  <span class="ABAstandard">character or reputation</span>; and 9.32(l) <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>. The
  record supports the aggravating factors of 9.22(a) <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary offense</span> and
  9.22(i) <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (herein "Standard") 4.53(a) suggests a public
  reprimand is appropriate when a lawyer: "demonstrates [a] failure to understand relevant legal doctrines or
  procedures and causes injury or potential injury to a client." Respondent failed to adhere to the requirement that
  each signatory appear before him to execute the Act of Exchange in order to notarize the document.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Without argument or analysis, ODC, in its Notice of Objection, objected to the Committee's
  determination that the Respondent timely made good faith efforts to rectify the consequences of his misconduct. About
  five months after Respondent notarized and filed the Act of Exchange, he was served with a civil suit regarding the
  Act of Exchange and received a copy of the disciplinary complaint. H.C. trans. pp. 64-65. Several of the family
  members claimed the Act of Exchange was not what they wanted and only then did Respondent learn that some of the
  signatures on the document were not genuine. H.C. trans. p. 64. All the parties, including Respondent, went to
  mediation. All the family members ratified the Act of Exchange and the sale of the property to BITT Investments,
  L.L.C. was finalized. Respondent paid $2,000 in damages, Larry Caillier (the family member who obtained the
  signatures on the document and returned it to the Respondent) paid $10,225 in damages and BITT paid an additional
  $10,000. The Board should find that Respondent did make a timely good faith effort to rectify his misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Standard <span class="ABAstandard">5.13</span> provides for a reprimand "when a lawyer knowingly
  engages in any other conduct that involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation and that adversely
  reflects on the lawyer's fitness to practice law." Respondent fully acknowledged that he notarized the Act of
  Exchange even though all the signatories did not execute the document in his presence. This is a misrepresentation
  which affects the integrity and reliability of the public records.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Standard <span class="ABAstandard">6.13</span> permits a public reprimand "when a lawyer is
  negligent either in determining whether statements or documents are false . . . and causes injury or potential injury
  to a party to the legal proceeding, or causes an adverse or potentially adverse effect on the legal proceeding."
  Respondent's failure to ensure that each signatory sign the document in his presence precluded him from verifying
  that all the signatures were, in fact, genuine.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC objected to the Committee's conclusion that Respondent "reasonably" believed that all the
  signatures were genuine. Respondent testified that he knew the Caillier family for twenty-eight (28) years which
  included the parents and twelve children. Respondent entrusted Larry Caillier, the Chief of Police in Opelousas,
  Louisiana, and husband of fifteen years to Respondent's niece, to obtain the signatures of his family members, many
  of whom Respondent had represented over the years. During the succession, Respondent cleared judgments and liens
  against several of the heirs to permit the subsequent land sale to BITT to go free and clear of liens and
  encumbrances. Years earlier, Respondent had been engaged to one of the Caillier heirs. H.C. trans. pp. 27 - 33.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent testified unequivocally that he understood that all the Caillier heirs agreed to the
  Act of Exchange and believed that each signed voluntarily. H.C. trans. p. 43. ODC failed to put forth any argument in
  its Notice of Objection as to why the Committee was wrong in determining that Respondent's belief was unreasonable.
  The Committee had the opportunity to observe the Respondent first hand during the hearing. Based upon the Committee's
  credibility determination and the transcript testimony, the Board finds that Respondent could reasonably believe that
  all owners had signed the Act of Exchange.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">It is clear from the record that Respondent in no way attempted to defraud any heir or party nor
  did he act in forging certain heirs' signatures to the Act of Exchange. Respondent is in violation of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct because he failed to have the document properly executed before him as notary.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC objected to the Committee's legal conclusion that ODC had abandoned the claim of Respondent's
  failure to notify all the heirs of the succession proceeding. ODC did not provide any argument as to how ODC had
  maintained and/or proven its claim. See ODC's Notice of Objection dated April 16, 2002. Based upon the hearing
  transcript, evidence, and the stipulation of facts, the Committee correctly determined that ODC had abandoned its
  claim. The Board dismisses ODC's claim of failure to notify the heirs for a lack of clear and convincing
  evidence.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court publicly reprimanded an attorney for failing to disclose the
  existence of a collateral mortgage to a third party. <span class="CITE"><i>In re Roger C. Sellers</i>, 95-2764 (La.
  3/15/96); <a  href="../SC/1996-03-15_1995-2764.htm">669 So.2d 1204</a></span>. Sellers' client
  instructed him not to reveal the existence of a mortgage despite language in the mortgage assuring that the property
  was free and clear of liens and encumbrances and that Sellers (the notary) was in possession of mortgage certificates
  verifying the free and clear status. The Court rejected the Board's recommendation of a one year suspension because
  the Respondent had no prior discipline and received no monetary benefit from the transaction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The cases of <i>In re Andre P. Gauthier</i> and <i>In re C. Kenneth Deshotel</i> are both
  applicable to the instant matter. In <i>Gauthier</i>, the Board found the following mitigating factors supported a
  public reprimand: absence of prior discipline; absence of a dishonest motive; timely good faith effort to make
  restitution and rectify the consequences of his actions; full and free disclosure to the board and cooperation in the
  disciplinary process; good character or reputation and remorse. No aggravating factors were found. Gauthier notarized
  a mortgage that was not executed in his presence and was later found to have been forged.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <i>Deshotel</i>, the Board affirmed the hearing committee's recommendation of a public
  reprimand for an attorney who notarized after the marriage a pre-nuptial marriage contract dated before the marriage,
  which rendered the contract null. The Board was persuaded by the mitigating factors of absence of prior discipline in
  a forty-six year career, absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, full and free disclosure and cooperation with the
  disciplinary process, character or reputation, remorse and Deshotel's "refusal to lie about his misconduct at trial
  (civil litigation that arose twenty-five years after the act) as a good faith effort to rectify the consequences of
  his misconduct." <i>In re Deshotel,</i> p.3. The Board noted the aggravating factor of substantial experience in the
  practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The facts, the ABA Standards, case law and the mitigating factors support a public reprimand.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that Elbert L. Guillory be publicly reprimanded for his
  violation of 1.1(a), 4.1(a), 8.3(a) and 8.4(a) and (c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. It is further ordered
  that the Respondent be assessed the costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running
  thirty days from the date of finality of this Ruling until paid.</p>
