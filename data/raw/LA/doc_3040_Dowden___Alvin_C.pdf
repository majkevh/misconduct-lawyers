  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE"><b>RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</b></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based upon the filing of formal charges by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel (herein "ODC") against Alvin C. Dowden, Jr. (herein "Respondent") of Leesville, Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On June 21, 2000, the disciplinary hearing was conducted before Hearing Committee No. 31 (herein
  the "Committee"). ODC and Respondent filed pre-hearing and post-hearing memoranda. Both ODC and Respondent presented
  their cases by documentary evidence and live testimony. The Committee filed its opinion on September 20, 2000, and
  recommended Respondent be publicly reprimanded for his violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct
  <span class="allegedrules">1.7</span>, <span class="allegedrules">1.11(a)</span> and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span>. Panel "C" heard this matter on December 14, 2000.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Formal charges were filed against Respondent who is the prosecutor for the City of Leesville. The
  charges arose from Respondent's representation of Randall Langton in a civil matter against his ex-wife, Teri Langton
  while criminal charges were pending against Mr. Langton.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On January 1, 1996, Mrs. Langton filed a criminal complaint against Mr. Langton alleging he
  physically abused her. Respondent, as prosecutor, interviewed Teri Langton and other witnesses and determined that he
  could not prove a case of simple battery against Mr. Langton. Rather than dismiss the charge of simple battery, he
  placed Mr. Langton on "prosecutor's probation"<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" class="fn" id="_ednref1">[i]</a> and
  continued the criminal matter without date. Approximately eight months later, while the criminal charge was still
  pending, Mr. Langton employed Respondent to defend him in a civil proceeding initiated by Mrs. Langton for the
  collection of child support.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC charged Respondent with violating 1.7<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn"
  id="_ednref2">[ii]</a>, 1.11(a)<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" class="fn" id="_ednref3">[iii]</a> and
  8.4(d)<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" class="fn" id="_ednref4">[iv]</a> of the Rules of Professional Conduct for
  engaging in a conflict of interest and for conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>

  <h2><span class="cite"><a   href="../HC/2000-09-20_00-DB-028.htm">THE HEARING COMMITTEE'S
  REPORT</a></span></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Committee found that Respondent's conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice
  and that a conflict of interest existed. Respondent was the city prosecutor responsible for prosecuting Mr. Langton
  for the charge of simple battery of his ex-wife. At the same time, Respondent represented Mr. Langton in a civil suit
  initiated by his ex-wife.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Although Respondent had obtained an affidavit from Mr. Langton waiving any conflict of interest,
  the Committee noted that he could not obtain a waiver from his other client, the City of Leesville. Based upon ABA
  <i>Informal Op</i>. 922, the Committee opined that the public could not waive a conflict of interest for an attorney
  representing "inherently antagonistic positions" H.C. Opinion p.4.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Despite Respondent's assertions that he considered the criminal case finished because he
  determined he could not prove the charges against Mr. Langton, he had elected not to dismiss the charges. The
  Committee found that Respondent considered the prosecution of the criminal charge still possible. H.C. Opinion p.3,
  ft.nt. 1.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <h3>I. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The powers and duties of the Disciplinary Board are defined in Section 2 of the Louisiana Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement. Subsection (G) (2)(a) states that the Board is "to perform
  appellate review functions, consisting of review of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of
  hearing committees with respect to formal charges. . . and prepare and forward to the court its own findings, if any,
  and recommendations."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Inasmuch as the Board is serving in an appellate capacity, the standard of review applied to
  findings of fact is that of "manifest error." <i>Arceneaux v. Domingue</i>, 365 So. 2d 1330 (La. 1978); <i>Rosell v.
  Esco</i>, 549 So. 2d 840 (La. 1989). The Board conducts a de novo review of the hearing committee's application of
  the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct. <span class="cite"><i>In re Hill</i>,
  <a href="1992-01-22_90-DB-004.htm">90-DB-004</a></span>.</p>

  <h3>II. THE MANIFEST ERROR INQUIRY</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court has approved of the Disciplinary Board's application of the manifest
  error standard in its review of the Committee's factual findings. <span class="cite"><i>In re Caulfield</i>, No.
  96-1401, p. 4 (La. 11/25/96); <a href="../SC/1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a>, 717</span>; <i>citing</i>,
  <span class="cite"><i>In re Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La.3/11/94), <a href="../SC/1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d
  150</a></span>. "In civil cases, the appropriate standard for appellate review of factual determinations is the
  manifest error-clearly wrong standard which precludes the setting aside of a trial court or jury's finding of fact
  unless those findings are clearly wrong in light of the record reviewed in its entirety." <i>Caulfield</i>, No.
  96-1401, p. 4; 683 So. 2d 714, 717; <i>citing,</i> <i>Alexander v. Pellerin Marble &amp; Granite</i>, 93-1698
  (La.1/14/94), 630 So. 2d 706; <i>Rosell v. Esco</i>, 549 So. 2d 840 (La.1989).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Panel finds that the facts as determined by the Committee are not manifestly erroneous.
  Respondent's argument that no conflict of interest existed rested on his contention that the criminal case, in
  effect, was complete. The evidence however, does not support his contention. In fact, Respondent admitted that the
  criminal case remained pending and that the placing on "prosecutor's probation" did not prohibit him from exercising
  his discretion to prosecute Mr. Langton. Thus, an actual conflict did exist as found by the Committee.</p>

  <h3>III. DE NOVO REVIEW OF THE APPLICATION OF THE RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the record in this matter, the Board makes the following findings concerning the
  Committee's determination of violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A. Rule <span class="Rules">1.7</span> has been violated. It is misconduct for a lawyer to
  represent a client whose representation may be materially limited by the lawyer's representation of another client.
  Respondent simultaneously represented the City of Leesville, who maintained a charge against Mr. Langton of simple
  battery of his ex-wife, while defending Mr. Langton in a civil proceeding against his ex-wife. Respondent did not
  have and could not have obtained a waiver of conflict from the City of Leesville.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">B. Rule 1.11(a) has not been violated. It is misconduct for a lawyer to represent a private
  client with regard to a matter that he participated in personally and substantially as a public officer. The
  Respondent represented Mr. Langton in a civil matter involving child support. Respondent, as prosecutor, was involved
  in the criminal charge of simple battery by Mr. Langton. The Respondent did not privately represent Mr. Langton in a
  matter that he, Respondent, was involved in as city prosecutor. There is no evidence to support this violation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">C. Rule <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> has been violated. It is professional misconduct for a
  lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice. Respondent represented the City of
  Leesville, whose interest is the safety and welfare of its citizens. At the same time, he began privately
  representing Mr. Langton, who had a pending criminal charge in the City of Leesville. Respondent's representation of
  Mr. Langton, a private paying client, puts him at odds with his position as city prosecutor, to seek a conviction
  against Mr. Langton.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2)  whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4)  the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon the facts and violations proven by the record, Respondent has negligently violated the
  duty owed to his clients, the City of Leesville and Mr. Langton, by representing interests that inherently conflict.
  Although actual harm caused by Respondent's actions was not proven, the potential for injury to both clients is
  significant. As the City of Leesville's prosecutor, Respondent's independence, loyalty, and credibility have been
  impaired. As the prosecutor, Respondent owes his client the City of Leesville the duty to prosecute those who violate
  the law and the discretion to determine whether to do so. The simultaneous representation of Mr. Langton in a private
  civil matter for which Respondent is paid while a criminal charge against Mr. Langton remains pending created a
  conflict which on its face adversely affected the representation of his clients and generated conflicting
  loyalties.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The following aggravating factors are present: 9.22(g) (r<span class="ABAstandard">efusal to
  acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct</span>) and 9.22(i) (<span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the
  practice of law</span>). There is no evidence to support mitigating factors.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> to
  determine the baseline sanction by "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's mental state and the extent of the injury
  caused; and then adjust the sanction in accordance with the aggravating and mitigating factors present."
  <span class="cite"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94); <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d
  343</a>, 350</span> .</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The proposed sanction of public reprimand is consistent with the ABA guidelines. Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.33</span> suggests reprimand is appropriate when "a lawyer is negligent in determining
  whether the representation . . . will adversely affect another client, and causes injury or potential injury to a
  client." Although Respondent argued that no further action was anticipated on the criminal case, he admitted that the
  criminal case remained pending and could be resurrected, particularly upon the occurrence of another incidence
  between him and his ex-wife. H.C. trans. p. 57, ln.1-5 and ln.17-22, p. 63, ln. 3-12. Thus, the positions of the
  clients who he simultaneously represented conflict.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Although Respondent obtained a conflict waiver from Mr. Langton, the conflict issue was not
  resolved. First, the conflict waiver was not obtained until approximately two and one-half months after the
  representation began and only three days before the October 21, 1996, child support hearing. That it finally was
  obtained only three days before the child support hearing, makes suspect the requisite voluntary nature of the
  waiver. In any event, Respondent's inability to obtain a waiver from his other client, the City of Leesville, means
  that the conflict issue never was properly resolved because both clients must waive the conflict.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Although suspension has been imposed where a conflict of interest existed, most notably in
  <span class="cite"><i>In re Mitchell Herzog</i>, 98-0761 (La. 5/1/98); <a 
  href="../SC/1998-05-01_1998-0671.htm">703 So.2d 592</a></span> , the situation here does not justify suspension.
  Unlike <i>Herzog</i> where the attorney caused substantial damage to his client due to the conflict of interest,
  Respondent's conflicting representation here did not cause substantial damage. Accordingly, suspension is not
  warranted.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, the Disciplinary Board finds that Respondent, Alvin C. Dowden, Jr.,
  violated Rules 1.7 and 8.4(d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct and adopts the Committee's recommendation of a
  public reprimand. The Board rejects the Committee's finding of a violation of Rule 1.11(a). The Board orders the
  Respondent be issued a public reprimand and that he be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings with
  legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this ruling until paid. Finally, it is
  ordered that in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 17B, notice of this reprimand shall be published in
  the journal of the state bar and in a newspaper of general circulation for the Parish of Vernon.</p>
