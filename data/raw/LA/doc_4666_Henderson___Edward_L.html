  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">In February 1997, McArthur Schales and Calvin Moss retained respondent to represent them in a
  personal injury matter arising out of an automobile accident.  Respondent filed suit in state court on October 2,
  1997, but the defendants subsequently removed the case to federal court.  On January 30, 1998, defendant Mark Jones
  (the driver of the vehicle that struck Mr. Schales and Mr. Moss) was dismissed without prejudice due to respondent's
  failure to serve Mr. Jones properly.  On November 4, 1998, the case was dismissed without prejudice as to the
  remaining defendants due to respondent's failure to comply with court orders relating to pre-trial matters. 
  Respondent failed to inform his clients of the dismissal, and over the following year, he misled them about the
  status of the case. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In November 2000, Mr. Schales and Mr. Moss filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC.  On
  November 30, 2000, the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail.  Respondent failed to
  reply to the complaint.  The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on January 30,
  2001 and answer the complaint under oath.  Respondent failed to appear, and he failed to produce the records that had
  been requested in conjunction with the ODC's investigation of the complaint.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed two counts of formal charges against respondent, alleging that
  his conduct in the Schales/Moss matter violates the following provisions of the Louisiana Rules of Professional
  Conduct: Rules <span class="Rules">1.1(a)</span> (failure to provide competent representation to a client),
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (failure to act with diligence and promptness in representing a client), 1.4 (failure
  to communicate with a client), <span class="Rules">1.7(b)</span> (representing a client when the representation is
  materially limited by the lawyer's own interests), <span class="Rules">3.4(a)</span> (unlawfully obstructing another
  party's access to evidence), <span class="Rules">3.4(c)</span> (knowing disobedience of an obligation under the rules
  of a tribunal), <span class="Rules">8.1(b)</span> (knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand for information from
  a disciplinary authority), <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation), <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct),
  <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation),
  <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation).  In addition, the ODC
  alleged that respondent violated <span class="Rules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 9(c)</span> by failing to appear
  pursuant to a subpoena. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent answered the formal charges and generally denied any misconduct.<a href="#_ftn1"
  name="_ftnref1" class="fn" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>  Accordingly, this matter proceeded to a formal hearing on the
  merits.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2002-09-06_02-DB-024.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">After reviewing the record of this matter, the hearing committee made a factual finding that the
  lawsuit filed by respondent on behalf of Mr. Schales and Mr. Moss was dismissed by the federal court on November 4,
  1998; respondent failed to timely and adequately communicate to his clients the fact of the dismissal and its
  significance; respondent advanced funds to his clients after the lawsuit was dismissed; respondent did not respond to
  a subpoena from the ODC; and respondent did not cooperate with the ODC in its investigation.  Based on these factual
  findings, the committee determined respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct.<a href="#_ftn2"
  name="_ftnref2" class="fn" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>  However, the committee noted that respondent's misconduct occurred
  in the same time frame as the misconduct at issue in respondent's disbarment in <i>Henderson I</i>.<a href="#_ftn3"
  name="_ftnref3" class="fn" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>  Accordingly, the committee recommended that respondent be adjudged
  guilty of additional violations warranting disbarment, to be considered in the event respondent makes a future
  application for readmission. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3><a href="../db/2003-03-26_02-DB-024.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">After reviewing the record of this matter, the disciplinary board agreed the hearing committee's
  factual findings are not manifestly erroneous,<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" class="fn" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> and
  generally concurred in the committee's application of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  The board found that
  respondent knowingly and intentionally violated duties owed to his clients when he failed to adhere to the federal
  court's order, failed to seek reinstatement of his clients' case after it was dismissed, failed to advise his clients
  of the dismissal, and failed to cooperate with the ODC.  Mr. Schales and Mr. Moss were harmed by the loss of their
  day in court and the disciplinary system's resources were expended for a subpoena which resulted in a <i>proces
  verbal</i> disposition.  The board concluded the baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is disbarment.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the board recognized respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">prior
  disciplinary offenses</span>,<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" class="fn" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>
  <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith obstruction of the
  disciplinary process</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the
  conduct</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span> (admitted 1981). 
  The board found no mitigating factors are present.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The board agreed with the hearing committee that respondent's misconduct occurred in the same
  time frame as the misconduct at issue in respondent's 2002 disbarment.  Accordingly, the board recommended that
  respondent be adjudged guilty of additional violations warranting disbarment, to be considered in the event
  respondent makes a future application for readmission.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court.  La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B).  Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence.  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Quaid</i>,
  94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana
  State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall</i>, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. While we are
  not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have
  held the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings.  <i>See</i>
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Caulfield</i>, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d
  714</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94),
  <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The record supports a finding of professional misconduct that is unquestionably serious in
  nature.  Respondent failed to comply with pre-trial orders issued by a federal court, and as a consequence, his
  clients' case was dismissed.  Thereafter, respondent failed to take any steps to have the case reinstated, and he
  failed to advise his clients of the dismissal.  No less serious is the fact that respondent failed to cooperate with
  the ODC in its investigation and failed to appear for a sworn statement in response to a subpoena.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Having found evidence of professional misconduct, the sole issue presented for our consideration
  is the appropriate sanction for respondent's actions.  In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary
  proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the
  profession, and deter future misconduct.  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>,
  <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.  The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances.  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So.2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent's conduct caused his clients to suffer actual harm in the loss of their cause of
  action.  There are no mitigating factors present; however, numerous aggravating factors exist.  Under these
  circumstances, we conclude disbarment is the proper sanction. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As the hearing committee and disciplinary board correctly noted, the substantive misconduct at
  issue in this case occurred in the same time frame as the misconduct forming the basis of respondent's disbarment in
  <i>Henderson I</i>.  In <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain</i>,
  <a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 So. 2d 470</a> (La. 1991)</span>, we observed that when the underlying conduct
  occurs within the same period as the misconduct forming the basis of a previous disbarment, the discipline imposed
  should be determined as if both proceedings were before the court simultaneously.  Applying this procedure in
  <i>Chatelain</i>, we declined to extend the minimum period for readmission.  Instead, we adjudged the respondent
  guilty of additional violations warranting disbarment which were added to his record for consideration in the event
  he applied for readmission after becoming eligible to do so.  <i>See also</i> <span class="CITE"><i>In re:
  Patrick</i>, 01-1419 (La. 3/15/02), <a href="2002-03-15_2001-1419.htm">815 So. 2d 804</a></span>;
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Gros</i>, 98-0772 (La. 3/15/02), <a href="2002-03-15_1998-0772.htm">815 So. 2d
  799</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Parker</i>, 00-3532 (La. 3/15/02),
  <a href="2002-03-15_2001-3532.htm">815 So. 2d 794</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction in the instant case, we believe the approach of
  <i>Chatelain</i> is instructive.  Accordingly, our determination of a sanction will be based upon the appropriate
  sanction we would have imposed if these charges had been before the court at the same time as the charges in
  respondent's previous disciplinary proceeding.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Had the instant charges been filed simultaneously with those charges forming the basis of
  respondent's earlier disbarment, they would have only reinforced our view that respondent lacks the moral fitness to
  practice law and must be disbarred, both as a sanction for his misconduct and to protect the public.  Therefore, as
  in <i>Chatelain</i>, we will adjudge respondent guilty of additional violations which warrant disbarment and which
  will be added to his record for consideration in the event he applies for readmission after becoming eligible to do
  so.  We further emphasize that although respondent may have a procedural right to apply for readmission, this court
  retains absolute discretion to grant or deny such an application.  In light of respondent's lengthy history of
  egregious misconduct, this court will carefully scrutinize any application for readmission with a critical eye.</p>

  <h2>  DECREE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Edward L. Henderson be adjudged guilty of additional violations which
  warrant disbarment and which may be considered in the event he applies for readmission from his disbarment in <i>In
  re:  Henderson</i>, 02-0903 (La. 6/6/02), <a href="2002-06-06_2002-0903.htm">819 So. 2d 296</a>, after becoming
  eligible to do so.  All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's
  judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" class="fn" id="_ftn1">[1]</a>  Respondent admitted that he
  was retained to represent Mr. Schales and Mr. Moss, and that one of the defendants in the case was dismissed without
  prejudice by the court.  Respondent also admitted he failed to appear at the ODC's offices on January 10, 2001. The
  remaining allegations of the formal charges were denied.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" class="fn" id="_ftn2">[2]</a>  The committee found the ODC
  proved the formal charges by clear and convincing evidence, but refused to find a violation of Rule 8.4(c), relating
  to conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. At the formal hearing, the ODC had suggested
  respondent did not inform his clients of the dismissal of their suit because he was attempting to "string them along"
  until the delay for filing a malpractice suit had passed. While conceding it was "possible to so conclude," the
  committee ultimately did not find clear and convincing evidence to support the ODC's assertion.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" class="fn" id="_ftn3">[3]</a>  The disbarment in
  <i>Henderson I</i> involved misconduct occurring between November 1992 and December 1999.  The substantive misconduct
  at issue in the instant matter occurred between 1997 and 1999.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" class="fn" id="_ftn4">[4]</a>  The board added additional
  factual findings with respect to the cause for the federal court's dismissal of the Schales/Moss personal injury
  case.  On April 8, 1998, the court entered a minute entry noting that respondent, as counsel for the plaintiffs, had
  failed to initiate the process by which the parties schedule pre-trial deadlines.  The court cautioned that
  respondent's failure to abide by the "plan of work" order could lead to the dismissal of the case.  On November 5,
  1998, the court entered judgment dismissing the case without prejudice due to respondent's failure to abide by the
  April 8, 1998 order.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" class="fn" id="_ftn5">[5]</a>  In addition to the 2002
  disbarment, respondent was suspended by this court for a period of two years in May 2000. <i>In re: Henderson</i>,
