      <p>On or about July 31, 2000, Demetria Marie LeDay retained your services for an Article 103 divorce action, and
      paid $400.00 for "divorce/ costs/ curator fee." On August 2, 2000, Ms. LeDay executed a verification affidavit
      for the Petition for Divorce (103) that was to be filed in the 14 Judicial District Court in Calcasieu Parish.
      For several months thereafter, you failed or refused to keep your client advised as to the status of her case,
      and failed or refused to respond to her numerous requests for information. In December 2000, you advised Ms.
      LeDay that her divorce would be final in January 2001. You filed the petition for divorce on or about January 2,

  <h4><span class="CITE"><a href="../HC/2003-02-26_01-DB-066.htm">01-DB-066:</a></span></h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon the deemed admitted rule, Committee #18 determined that the allegations of the formal
  charges were proven by clear and convincing evidence and that Rules 3.4(c), 8.1(c), 8.4(a) and 8.4(g) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct, at Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 9(a) and (c) had been violated.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Committee found that Respondent failed to respond to five subpoenas and failed to cooperate
  with five disciplinary investigations, and failed to participate in five disciplinary proceedings.  Committee #18
  recognized the following aggravating factors:  prior discipline (admonition issued February 18, 2002 [<i>sic</i>
  2/18/2000] and June 25, 1997); a pattern of misconduct; a bad-faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceedings by
  intentionally failing to comply with disciplinary rules; refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of her conduct; and
  indifference to rectifying the consequences of her misconduct.  Without reference to jurisprudence or the <i>ABA
  Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> (herein "Standards"), the Committee recommended an eighteen-month
  suspension.</p>

  <h4><span class="CITE"><a href="../HC/2003-02-10_02-db-014.htm">02-DB-014:</a></span></h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon the deemed admitted rule, Committee #22 found the allegations of the formal charges
  were proven by clear and convincing evidence and that Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.5(f)(6), 1.16(d), 3.2, 3.4(c), 8.1(c) and
  8.4(a), (d) and (g) of the Rules of Professional Conduct and Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 9(a) and (c) had been
  violated.  The Committee was particularly concerned about Mr. Oldham's claim that over several years he had paid
  Respondent $6,950 to handle several different legal matters and $2,961.00 to handle a succession.<a href="#_ftn12"
  name="_ftnref12" class="fn" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a>Mr. Oldham stated that Respondent did not complete the legal
  matters and did not commence the probate proceedings.  The Committee found Respondent had no regard for the interest
  of her client and caused actual harm by failing to return unearned fees.  Furthermore, Respondent failed to appear
  pursuant to two subpoenas, had two prior admonitions and was currently under an eighteen-month suspension.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Committee #22 recommended that Respondent be suspended for two years to begin after the eighteen
  month suspension was completed, followed by thirteen months of probation with the following conditions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1.  That the Respondent should refrain from violating any Rules of Professional Conduct in the
    future;</p>

    <p class="inverted">2.  That the Respondent shall remain current with all obligations including Louisiana State Bar
    Association dues, disciplinary dues and assessments and all continuing legal education requirements;</p>

    <p class="inverted">3.  That the Respondent shall attend the Louisiana State Bar Association ethics school or
    conference or seminar;</p>

    <p class="inverted">4.  That a probation monitor should be appointed to periodically monitor Pamela Viney Mathews'
    client trust account as well as her compliance with all other conditions; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">5.  That Respondent shall pay all costs of the proceeding.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the deemed admitted rule, Committee #7 determined that allegations of the formal charges
  were proven by clear and convincing evidence and that Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.5(f)(6), 1.15(c), 1.16(a) and (d), 8.1(c) and
  8.4(a), (c) and (g) of the Rules of Professional Conduct and Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 9(c) had been violated. 
  The Committee found Respondent knowingly failed duties owed to her client, Ms. LeDay, by neglecting her divorce
  case.  Ms. LeDay was actually harmed by the loss of her $400 payment to Respondent for work not performed and by the
  ten-month delay in obtaining her divorce.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Committee determined the baseline sanction for all the misconduct was suspension.  However,
  the Committee found Respondent's misrepresentation concerning the timeliness of her legal services would have
  warranted a baseline sanction of a public reprimand rather than a suspension.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Committee found the aggravating factors of prior disciplinary offenses, a pattern of
  misconduct, failing to cooperate, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of her conduct, indifference to making
  restitution and multiple offenses.  The only mitigating facts were emotional problems.<a href="#_ftn13"
  name="_ftnref13" class="fn" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>

  <a href="../SC/2002-04-21_2001-3071.htm">816 So.2d 284</a></span><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" class="fn"

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <h3>I. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The powers and duties of the Disciplinary Board are defined in Section 2 of the Louisiana Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement.  Subsection (G)(2)(a) states that the Board is "to perform
  appellate review functions, consisting of review of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of
  hearing committees with respect to formal charges . . . and prepare and forward to the court its own findings, if
  any, and recommendations."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In as much as the Board is serving in an appellate capacity, the standard of review applied to
  findings of fact is that of "manifest error".  <i>Arceneaux v. Domingue</i>, 365 So.2d 1330 (La.1978); <i>Rosell v.
  Esco</i>, 549 So.2d 840 (La. 1989).</p>

  <h3>II.  THE MANIFEST ERROR INQUIRY</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon a respondent's failure to answer formal charges, "the factual allegations contained within
  the formal charges shall be deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence."  Rule XIX, Section
  11(E)(3).  The Committee has entered its order declaring the factual allegations deemed admitted and proven by clear
  and convincing evidence.</p>

  <h3>II.  DE NOVO REVIEW OF THE APPLICATION OF THE RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the record in this matter, the Board finds that the following Rules of
  Professional Conduct have been violated:</p>

  <h4>01-DB-066:</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Rules <span class="Rules">3.4(c)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(a) and (g)</span> and Rule XIX, Section 9(a) and (c) were violated in Counts I, II, III, IV
  and V by Respondent's failure to respond to a disciplinary complaint, failure to appear pursuant to a subpoena and
  failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation.</p>

  <h4>02-DB-014:</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Rules 3.4(c), 8.1(c) and 8.4(a) and (g) and Rule XIX, Section 9(a) and (c) were violated in Count
  I by Respondent's failure to respond to a disciplinary complaint, failure to appear pursuant to a subpoena and
  failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4</span>,
  <span class="Rules">1.5(f)(6)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span>, <span class="Rules">3.2</span>,
  <span class="Rules">3.4(c)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> and <span class="Rules">8.4(a), (d) and
  (g)</span> and Rule XIX, Section 9(a) and (c) were violated in Count II by Respondent's neglect of legal matters,
  failure to communicate with Mr. Oldham, failure to account for and refund unearned fees, failure to return client
  property upon termination, engagement in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, failure to appear
  pursuant to a subpoena, failure to respond to a disciplinary complaint and failure to cooperate with a disciplinary
  investigation.</p>

  <h4>02-DB-015:</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.5(f)(6), <span class="Rules">1.15(c)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.16(a)</span>
  and (d) and <span class="Rules">8.4(a) and (c)</span> were violated in Count I by Respondent's neglect of Ms. LeDay's
  divorce, failure to communicate with her, failure to account for and return unearned fees ($400.00), failure to
  properly terminate the client's representation and misrepresentations made to Ms. LeDay concerning the status of her
  case.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Rules 8.1(c), 8.4(a) and (g) and Rule XIX, Section 9(c) were violated in Count II by Respondent's
  failure to respond to a disciplinary complaint, failure to appear pursuant to a subpoena and failure to cooperate
  with a disciplinary investigation.</p>

  <h3>IV.  APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board finds Respondent knowingly and intentionally violated duties owed to her clients, Mr.
  Oldham and Ms. LeDay, by failing to use reasonable diligence, failing to communicate, failing to protect client
  property, failing to account for and return unearned fees, failing to properly terminate legal services and failing
  to return a client's file.  Respondent knowingly and intentionally violated duties owed to the legal system and owed
  as a professional by failing to appear pursuant to subpoenas, failing to respond to disciplinary complaints and
  failing to cooperate with disciplinary investigations.  Mr. Oldham and Ms. LeDay have been harmed by Respondent's
  failure to account for fees, return unearned fees and timely perform legal services.<a href="#_ftn17"
  name="_ftnref17" class="fn" id="_ftnref17">[17]</a>The disciplinary system expended additional resources to locate
  Respondent and to personally serve her eight subpoenas.  Respondent's failure to cooperate with the investigations
  impeded ODC's ability to investigate eight complaints.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.41</span> provides for disbarment where "(a) a lawyer
  abandons the practice and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client; or (b) a lawyer knowingly fails
  to perform services for a client and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client; or (c) a lawyer
  engages in a pattern of neglect with respect to client matters and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a
  client."  Respondent knowingly failed to perform services for Mr. Oldham and Ms. DeLay and deprived Mr. Oldham of his
  file.  Both clients eventually engaged other attorneys and paid a second set of attorney fees.  The record indicates
  that neither client has been refunded their money.  These factors warrant disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Other applicable standards militate in favor of suspension rather than disbarment.  Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.62</span> suggests suspension when "a lawyer knowingly deceives a client, and causes
  injury or potential injury to the client," while Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.61</span> suggests disbarment
  is warranted when the deception occurs with the "intent to benefit the lawyer or another".  Respondent took money
  from Mr. Oldham to administer a succession for which she performed no work.  Respondent also told Mrs. LeDay that her
  divorce would be finalized in a matter of weeks when the petition had not been served, much less filed.  Thus
  Respondent knowingly deceived clients.  But there is no showing that Respondent had the requisite intent to benefit
  herself or another.  Therefore, pursuant to Standard 4.62, suspension is the more appropriate ABA Standard.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Standard <span class="ABAstandard">6.22</span> suggests suspension when "a lawyer knows that he
  or she is violating a court order or rule, and causes injury or potential injury to a client or a party, or causes
  interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding," while Standard <span class="ABAstandard">6.21</span>
  suggests disbarment where the lawyer knowingly violates a court order with the "intent to obtain a benefit for the
  lawyer or another".  Respondent knew or should have known that her failure to respond to eight disciplinary
  complaints was a violation of the Supreme Court rule with which Louisiana attorneys are required to abide and that
  her failure to appear pursuant to eight subpoenas was a violation of a Supreme Court order.  However, the record does
  not establish that Respondent acted with the intent to gain a benefit.  Standard 6.22 therefore suggesting suspension
  is the appropriate ABA Standard.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Standard <span class="ABAstandard">7.2</span> suggests suspension is appropriate when "a lawyer
  knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional and causes injury or potential
  injury to a client, the public, or the legal system" while ABA Standard <span class="ABAstandard">7.1</span> suggests
  disbarment where the lawyer acts with the "intent to obtain a benefit for the lawyer or another".  Respondent here
  failed to account for and refund unearned fees, and failed to properly terminate legal services and return a client's
  file.  Respondent's actions harmed Mr. Oldham and Ms. LeDay.  Respondent's failure to cooperate with the disciplinary
  system harmed the legal system by wasting resources and delaying the investigation.  But the record does not
  establish that Respondent acted with the intent to gain a benefit.  Therefore, Standard 7.2 suggesting suspension is
  the appropriate ABA Standard.  The ABA Standards thus suggest that the baseline sanction lies between suspension and
  disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The record supports the aggravating factors of <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary
  offenses</span>,<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" class="fn" id="_ftnref19">[19]</a> a
  <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith failure to cooperate with the disciplinary process</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">indifference to making restitution and substantial experience in the practice of
  law</span>.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" class="fn" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a>The record supports a sole mitigating
  factor of <span class="ABAstandard">emotional problems</span> as evidenced by her hospitalization.<a href="#_ftn21"
  name="_ftnref21" class="fn" id="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Court has instructed that prior misconduct which occurred during the same time as current
  misconduct is not to be treated as an aggravating factor.  Rather, the prior misconduct should be considered
  contemporaneously with the current misconduct for the purpose of determining an appropriate sanction. 
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Darryl Jackson,</i> 02-2764, n. 3 (La. 4/9/03);

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent is currently suspended for misconduct involving harm to one client, Ms. Easton,
  between March 1999 and November 2000.  In the matter of <span class="CITE"><i>In re Pamela Viney Mathews</i>, 02-1377
  (La. 9/20/02); <a href="../SC/2002-09-20_2002-1377.htm">827 So.2d 1129</a></span>, the Court suspended Respondent for
  eighteen months for violating Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.5(f)(6), 1.16(d), 3.2, 3.4(c), 8.1(c) and 8.4(a) and (g) and has
  required her to provide a full accounting and refund of any unearned fees.  The misconduct in the Easton matter
  occurred between March 1999 and November 2000.  The instant matter occurred partly or completely during the same time
  as the misconduct for which Respondent was suspended.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref22">[22]</a>For the purpose of determining a sanction in the instant matter, the Easton misconduct is
  considered contemporaneously with the current matter.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering applicable case law, disbarment is warranted.  In the deemed admitted matter of
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Norwood M. Lyons</i>, 98 2590 (La. 12/11/98);
  <a href="../SC/1998-12-11_1998-2590.htm">722 So.2d 998</a></span>, the Court disbarred Lyons for neglect of legal
  matters, failure to communicate with clients, failure to refund unearned fees, misleading clients about the status of
  their cases, failure to return client files upon termination and failure to cooperate with the disciplinary process. 
  The Lyons' violations arose from complaints from four clients resulting in eight counts.  Although Lyons failed to
  respond to the complaints, he did appear pursuant to subpoenas and admitted some of his misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the case of <span class="CITE"><i>In re Jed G. Gremillion</i>, 98-0818 (La. 7/8/98);
  <a href="../SC/1998-07-08_1998-0818.htm">715 So.2d 397</a>,</span> Gremillion received a thirty-six month suspension,
  to run concurrently with a separate eighteen month suspension, rather than disbarment.  Three client complaints gave
  rise to six counts of misconduct involving lack of diligence, failure to comply with reasonable requests for
  information, failure to keep client funds separate from attorney's funds, failure to account for and refund unearned
  fees and failure to properly withdraw from client representation.  The aggravating factor was substantial experience
  in the practice of law and failure to cooperate with ODC in one set of formal charges.  The mitigating factors were
  lack of prior discipline, full payment of restitution prior to formal charges in some of the matters and cooperation
  with ODC in one set of formal charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's misconduct is more egregious than either <i>Gremillion</i> or <i>Lyons</i>.  Unlike
  <i>Gremillion</i>, Respondent has two prior admonitions for similar misconduct.  Between Respondent's prior
  suspension and current misconduct, she has many more violations than either <i>Gremillion</i> or <i>Lyons</i>.  She
  has nine counts of failing to cooperate with ODC and the disciplinary process, 8.1(c) and 8.4(g), and eight counts of
  knowingly disobeying the rules of a tribunal, Rule 3.4(c).  Respondent also has more aggravating factors than in
  <i>Gremillion</i> or <i>Lyons</i> and only one mitigating factor.  Moreover, Respondent, in effect, has abandoned the
  practice of law.  She has closed her office, discontinued her office telephone service and been ineligible to
  practice since September 4, 2001.  Given Respondent's numerous violations, the case law, the ABA Standards her
  abandonment of the practice of law, disbarment is recommended.</p>

  <h2>RECOMMENDATION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board finds that the factual allegations of the formal charges, 01-DB-066 C/W 02- DB-014 C/W
  02-DB-015, have been deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence and that ODC has proven the
  violation of Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.5(f)(6), 1.15(c), 1.16(a) and (d), 3.2, 3.4(c), 8.1(c) and 8.4(a), (c), (d) and (g) of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct and Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 9(a) and (c).  The Board recommends that Pamela
  Viney Mathews be disbarred; be required to refund to Mr. Oldham and Ms. LeDay $2,961.00 and $400.00 respectively,
  provide Mr. Oldham an accounting and refund of unearned fees, if any, for other legal work for which he had been
  paid; and be assessed all disciplinary costs.</p>

  prior disciplinary record (prior one year suspension with six months deferred and three admonitions), multiple
  offenses, a pattern of misconduct and an indifference to making restitution.  Mitigating factors were good character
  and reputation and personal and emotional problems (Dunn suffered from chronic severe depression).</p>

    inferred from Respondent's persistent refusal to account for and refund the unearned fees to Mr. Oldham and Ms.
    Leflay that Respondent intended to benefit herself.  However, this point is not important to the ultimate
