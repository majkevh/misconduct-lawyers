  disciplinary board ordering that respondent, Henry J. Lafont, Jr., be publicly reprimanded.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <h3>Count I – The Bone Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 1996, respondent was retained to represent Robert M. Bone in a second degree murder case
  pending in Lafourche Parish. The crime was particularly heinous and the district attorney's office refused
  respondent's efforts to plead the charge down to manslaughter. Under the circumstances, respondent advised Mr. Bone
  that it would be in his best interest to plead guilty to second degree murder, to show remorse, and to save the State
  the expense and cost of a trial. Respondent suggested to Mr. Bone that this course of action would improve his
  chances for obtaining a commutation of his life sentence, because there would be no public record of the specific
  details of the brutal crime. Respondent also conveyed to Mr. Bone his confidence that he could obtain a letter of "no
  comment" from the district attorney at the time he applied for commutation, although no such letter then existed or
  was promised to be forthcoming.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In December 1996, Mr. Bone pled guilty to the second degree murder charge. In connection with the
  guilty plea, the presiding judge, Judge Jerome J. Barbera, III, conducted a Boykin examination of Mr. Bone, as
  follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Q. The sentence for second degree murder is imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole
    or suspension of sentence. And that is not discretionary. I have no choice. If I accept your plea today, then that
    is what the sentence of this court must be. Has anyone assured you, Mr. Bone, or led you to believe that if you
    enter a plea of guilty to this charge today that at some time in the future that your sentence may be commuted to a
    term of years or that you may somehow be given favorable treatment either by the governor or by the department of
    probation and parole; has anyone promised you that?</p>

    <p>A. No, Your Honor.</p>

    <p>Q. I know that you have had maybe discussions with your lawyer about that.</p>

    <p>A. Yes, Your Honor.</p>

    <p>Q. But no one has made any assurances to you or any promises to you that anything favorable will happen in the
    future in your case; is that correct?</p>

    <p>A. That's correct.</p>

    <p>* * *</p>

    <p>THE COURT:<br />
    Mr. Lafont, are you satisfied that your client understands his rights and the consequences of his plea?</p>

    <p>MR. LAFONT:<br />
    Yes, I am, Judge.</p>

    <p>THE COURT:<br />
    All right. And you also assure the Court that as far as you know he has not been made any promises as to the
    favorable disposition of his case which might be different from what we have discussed here today?</p>

    <p>MR. LAFONT:<br />
    That is correct, Judge. [emphasis added]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Satisfied that Mr. Bone understood the consequences of his plea, the judge sentenced him to life
  in prison.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Sometime after the plea, Mr. Bone's mother, Judy Bone, requested that respondent give her a copy
  of the no-comment letter. Respondent told her that a no-comment letter existed and that he had seen a copy of it in
  the district attorney's file. According to respondent, he told Mrs. Bone this in order to comfort her, because he
  believed she was terminally ill. This conversation was tape-recorded by Mrs. Bone without respondent's knowledge.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In December 1999, Mr. Bone filed an application for post-conviction relief, claiming, among other
  things, that he pled guilty because respondent had promised the no-comment letter would be supplied by the district
  attorney. An evidentiary hearing was conducted in March 2000 in order to determine whether Mr. Bone's plea was free
  and voluntary. Prior to the hearing, a conference was conducted in Judge Barbera's chambers, attended by the judge,
  respondent, representatives of the district attorney's office, and Mr. Bone's newly retained counsel, Laurie White.
  The parties agreed that respondent's testimony would be stipulated in lieu of his live testimony. The district
  attorney, Walter Naquin, took handwritten notes as to how respondent would testify, and from these notes, an
  assistant district attorney prepared a typewritten stipulation that was read into the record by Ms. White. Respondent
  approved the handwritten notes but did not see or approve the typed version. Furthermore, neither respondent nor Mr.
  Naquin were present in court when Ms. White read from the typed stipulation into the record:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>MS. WHITE:<br />
    Counsel for the defendant and the State have entered into the following stipulation concerning the testimony of
    Henry Lafont. If Mr. Lafont was called as a witness, he would testify in the following manner: that he was the
    attorney of record for Robert Bone in connection with the charge of second degree murder; that Mr. Lafont advised
    Mr. Bone that he thought it was in Mr. Bone's best interest to plead guilty, . . . to show remorse and to save the
    state expenses and costs.</p>

    <p>Mr. Lafont further suggested that this may help Mr. Bone with regard to his chances for commutation.</p>

    <p>He further advised Mr. Bone that he thought he could obtain a letter of no-comment from the District Attorney's
    Office at the time of commutation, even though no such letter existed or was forthcoming or was promised.</p>

    <p>He further advised Mrs. Bone and Robert Bone, both before and after the guilty plea, that such a letter existed
    and was forthcoming, when in fact such a letter was not forthcoming from the DA's office.</p>

    <p>Mr. Lafont further advised Mr. Bone that if he pled guilty that his chances of having his life sentence reduced
    would be greater. Mr. Lafont suggested that a time period of 17 years was the statistical average if a life
    sentence was commuted.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In his testimony at the post-conviction hearing, Mr. Bone claimed that respondent told him if he
  pled guilty, the district attorney's office would promise a no-comment letter to a commutation of the sentence. He
  also testified that respondent told him both before and after the plea that he had seen the district attorney's
  no-comment letter; therefore, it was guaranteed. Mr. Bone further testified that before he pled guilty respondent
  told him that he would be eligible for commutation in seventeen to twenty-two years, which respondent later changed
  to fifteen years after doing more research. Finally, Mr. Bone told the court that he lied during the Boykin
  examination about being promised anything because respondent told him if he didn't plead guilty, "I'd make the DA
  very mad, and they would blow everything up and I wouldn't want to do that."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the stipulation and Mr. Bone's testimony, Judge Barbera vacated the guilty
  plea<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a> and filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC.
  Similar  complaints were filed by Ms. White and Mr. Naquin.</p>

  <h3>Count II – Respondent's DWI Conviction</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In July 2000, respondent was convicted of one count of driving while intoxicated, a misdemeanor
  violation of state law. Respondent was sentenced to serve six months in prison, which was suspended upon payment of a
  $1,000 fine and court costs, as well as the completion of other special conditions.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Following its investigation, the ODC filed two counts of formal charges against respondent. As to
  the Bone matter, the ODC alleged that respondent's conduct violated the following provisions of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct: Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.1(a)</span> (failure to provide competent representation to
  a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in
  representing a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a client),
  <span class="allegedrules">3.3(a)(1)</span> (making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal),
  <span class="allegedrules">3.3(a)(4)</span> (offering evidence that the lawyer knows to be false),
  <span class="allegedrules">3.4(b)</span> (falsifying evidence or offering an inducement to a witness to testify
  falsely), <span class="allegedrules">4.1</span> (knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a
  third person), <span class="allegedrules">4.4</span> (respect for rights of third persons),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or
  misrepresentation), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the
  administration of justice). As to the DWI matter, the ODC alleged that respondent's conduct violated Rule
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(b)</span> (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on the lawyer's honesty,
  trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an answer. With respect to the Bone matter, he denied telling Mr. Bone or his
  mother before the plea that a no-comment letter existed. He also insisted that the stipulation read into the record
  at the post-conviction hearing was inaccurate and differed from the handwritten stipulation he had read and approved.
  As to the DWI matter, respondent asserted that his misdemeanor conviction does not reflect on his fitness to practice
  law.</p>

  <h3>Formal Hearing</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This matter proceeded to a formal hearing, at which time the hearing committee heard the live
  testimony of several witnesses, including Ms. White, assistant district attorney Camille Morvant, Mr. Naquin, and
  Judge Barbera. Neither Mr. Bone nor his mother testified, though the transcript of Mr. Bone's post-conviction hearing
  was introduced into evidence. Respondent appeared at the hearing and testified on his own behalf.</p>

  <h4>TESTIMONY OF LAURIE WHITE</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Ms. White, who represented Mr. Bone in his post-conviction efforts and in his subsequent trial,
  testified that what led to the post-conviction proceedings was an audiotape secretly recorded by Mr. Bone's mother,
  on which respondent is heard saying that he had seen the no-comment letter in the district attorney's file but was
  unable to get a copy.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">She stated that she spoke with respondent on the telephone and at the courthouse before the
  hearing and he confirmed everything that would eventually go into the typed stipulation. An associate in her office
  also interviewed respondent, wherein he again confirmed everything. She also said that after being told about the
  tape, respondent again admitted everything in discussions with Judge Barbera and the district attorney, Walter
  Naquin.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Ms. White asserted that although the stipulation contained somewhat conflicting statements, it
  agreed with what respondent told her at one point or another in their various conversations. She also stated that she
  was not involved in writing the stipulation but did read it into the record at the hearing. She further testified
  that she could not recall if respondent was in the courtroom when the stipulation was read.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Ms. White found several things wrong with respondent's handling of Mr. Bone's guilty plea:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The fact that [respondent] told [Mr. Bone] that a life sentence would be 15 to 17 to 25 years is just not
    correct, and that the advice that he had given to the family basically was that a commutation was forthcoming, and
    commutations are not forthcoming, and that there was either a letter or a promise of a letter. . . .</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">When she asked Mr. Bone why he had lied about being promised anything during the Boykin
  examination, she testified,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>My client informed me that he was told he wasn't supposed to bring this up or make any waves about it, because
    that was going to make the District Attorney's Office mad and then this deal on this no contest letter would be
    thrown out the window.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h4>TESTIMONY OF CAMILLE MORVANT</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Morvant, the assistant district attorney who prosecuted Mr. Bone's case, testified that Ms.
  White told him about the audiotape but he never listened to it. He stated that he was not involved in the
  conversation that led to the stipulation. He also did not think respondent was in the courtroom when the stipulation
  was read. Mr. Morvant further testified that he never discussed a no-comment letter with respondent and certainly
  made no promises about same. He asserted that the only discussions he had with respondent were about respondent's
  request that he accept a manslaughter plea from Mr. Bone.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Morvant also stated that he had known respondent since 1982 and respondent seemed competent
  and honest.</p>

  <h4>TESTIMONY OF JUDGE JEROME BARBERA</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Judge Barbera, who presided over Mr. Bone's case, testified that what was told to Mr. Bone before
  and after the guilty plea was discussed with and agreed to by respondent during the conversation in his chambers
  before the hearing. However, he stated that he does not know what happened to the handwritten stipulation and could
  not recall if respondent read and approved the typed stipulation. Furthermore, he stated that he does not think
  respondent was in the courtroom when the stipulation was read.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Judge Barbera said that he considered a no-comment letter from the district attorney's office to
  be a favorable thing for a defendant and if respondent told Mr. Bone before the plea that he was certain he could get
  such a letter, then respondent and Mr. Bone should have answered differently in the Boykin examination. Furthermore,
  he felt that respondent had assured Mr. Bone that the district attorney's office would not object when commutation
  came up in the future even though the district attorney's office never made such an assurance. In fact, in his
  meeting with respondent before the hearing, respondent admitted he never discussed a no-comment letter with the
  district attorney's office. Therefore, Judge Barbera felt the plea was not free and voluntary.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Judge Barbera also testified that he has known respondent for a long time and found him to be
  honorable and honest.</p>

  <h4>TESTIMONY OF WALTER NAQUIN</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Naquin, the district attorney, testified that he confronted respondent about the tape and was
  aware that, before respondent knew about the tape, he had denied ever telling Mr. Bone's mother that he had seen the
  no-comment letter in the district attorney's file.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Naquin sat with respondent before the hearing and took handwritten notes of their discussion,
  which later became the typed stipulation. He asserted that the typed stipulation was what respondent had told him and
  what he had written down. However, he also stated that he does not believe respondent signed either the handwritten
  stipulation or the typed stipulation. Furthermore, he does not believe he showed respondent the typed stipulation,
  but only told him he did not have to testify and could leave. Mr. Naquin was not in the courtroom during the hearing,
  so he does not know if respondent was in the courtroom when the stipulation was read. He further testified that, to
  his knowledge, his handwritten notes were destroyed.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Naquin also testified as to respondent's good character.</p>

  <h4>TESTIMONY OF RESPONDENT</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In his testimony, respondent admitted to having a conversation with Mr. Bone about the
  possibility of applying for commutation, but he denied promising or representing that a favorable result would occur.
  Prior to the plea, another judge informed respondent that if a defendant pled guilty and showed remorse,
  statistically he would only have to serve 17 years before being able to apply for commutation, which he reiterated to
  Mr. Bone. Respondent thought it would help Mr. Bone with commutation in the future if he pled guilty and showed
  remorse instead of making everyone go through a trial. Respondent further testified that Mr. Bone's sentence would
  only be commuted "if [Mr. Bone] behaved, if everything went well, if the Board agreed, if we had a good governor, all
  that came into play, and all that was explained to Mr. Bone."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent also admitted to informing Mr. Bone that he was confident he could obtain a no-comment
  letter from the district attorney's office, which he later admitted had a great influence on Mr. Bone's decision to
  plead guilty. Furthermore, respondent admitted that after the plea, he told Mr. Bone's mother the no-comment letter
  existed. He also admitted this conduct was wrong, a mistake, and an error in judgment on his part, for which he was
  remorseful because of the wasted time and pain caused. However, he did not do it to gain an advantage but to give
  hope to Ms. Bone, who led him to believe she was dying. At that time, he even forgave the remaining $10,000 of the
  $15,000 legal fee Mr. Bone had agreed to pay.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">When Ms. White informed him that she had been retained to try to get Mr. Bone a new trial,
  respondent asserted that he cooperated with her and did not try to hide anything. However, he denied ever telling Ms.
  White that he informed Mr. Bone before the plea that a no-comment letter existed. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Judge Barbera and Mr. Naquin told respondent about the tape, but respondent was not offered a
  chance to listen to the tape. Thereafter, he told Mr. Naquin, who took handwritten notes, that he informed Mr. Bone
  before the plea that he was "extremely confident" he could get a no-comment letter from the district attorney's
  office. He then stated to Mr. Naquin that he told Mr. Bone's mother after the plea that the letter existed.
  Respondent read over Mr. Naquin's notes but did not review the typed stipulation or sit in court as it was read. He
  denied that he stipulated to telling Mr. Bone or his mother before the plea that the letter existed; however, he
  agreed with everything else in the typed stipulation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent further denied allowing Mr. Bone to make erroneous statements or making erroneous
  statements himself at the Boykin examination. He also claimed that Judge Barbera vacated Mr. Bone's plea because Mr.
  Bone seemed to be confused by what respondent told him before the plea and not because respondent lied to Mr.
  Bone.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2003-05-05_01-DB-042.htm">Report of the Hearing Committee</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the evidence presented at the hearing, the hearing committee found that respondent
  violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges. Respondent failed to provide competent
  representation because of his admitted lack of experience in handling second degree murder cases and because of
  misrepresentations he made to Mr. Bone about obtaining the no-comment letter. He also failed to act diligently
  because his entire representation of Mr. Bone consisted of convincing him to plead guilty. Respondent failed to keep
  Mr. Bone reasonably informed of the status of the no-comment letter and as such failed to comply with his requests
  for information. During the Boykin examination, respondent made false statements to the court concerning reassurances
  he made to Mr. Bone about the no-comment letter and allowed Mr. Bone to make the same false statements to the court.
  Furthermore, the rights of the court as a third party were violated when respondent and Mr. Bone made these false
  statements. Not only did respondent make false statements to the court, but he also made false statements to Mr. Bone
  when he told his client that the no-comment letter actually existed. Therefore, respondent's assurances to his client
  and false statements to the court that led to Mr. Bone's guilty plea were prejudicial to the administration of
  justice. Finally, the committee determined respondent's DWI conviction reflects adversely on his honesty,
  trustworthiness, and fitness as a lawyer.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee indicated that no mitigating factors were present. It did not address the subject
  of aggravating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In light of its factual findings and determinations of rule violations, the committee recommended
  that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for three years. This recommendation was based on respondent's
  lack of diligence and competence in representing Mr. Bone and his knowingly permitting false statements to be made to
  the court. The committee further recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs of this proceeding.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Both respondent and the ODC filed objections to the report and recommendation of the hearing
  committee.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-07-19_01-DB-042.htm">Ruling of the Disciplinary Board</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the record, the disciplinary board found the committee's factual findings to be
  manifestly erroneous. Conducting a de novo review of the record, the board determined that neither Mr. Bone's
  testimony at his post-conviction hearing nor the stipulation offered by respondent provided clear and convincing
  evidence that respondent made false statements to Mr. Bone, Mr. Bone's mother, or the court before Mr. Bone pled
  guilty. Mr. Bone's testimony was self-serving, and respondent never read the typed stipulation that was read into the
  record. Therefore, these two things only established that respondent was overly confident in assuring Mr. Bone that
  he thought he would be able to obtain a no-comment letter from the district attorney's office. Furthermore, the board
  found that the statements respondent made to Mr. Bone before the plea did not rise to the level of assurances and
  promises; therefore, no false statements were made by either respondent or Mr. Bone during the Boykin examination.
  Finally, the board found respondent's DWI charge is a misdemeanor and not a "serious crime." Based on its own factual
  findings, the board determined that respondent's conduct violated Rules 4.1 and 8.4(a) of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board found that respondent violated duties owed as a professional. Respondent's conduct was
  both negligent and knowing. He harmed both Mr. Bone and Mr. Bone's mother after the guilty plea by telling them the
  no-comment letter existed. To the extent that this conduct contributed to Mr. Bone's guilty plea being vacated, the
  events of the murder were resurrected for the family of Mr. Bone's victim.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the board determined the baseline
  sanction for respondent's misconduct is a public reprimand. The aggravating factors present include respondent's
  <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary offenses</span><a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a>
  and <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span> (admitted 1979). In mitigation,
  the board acknowledged the <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest or selfish motive</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board and a cooperative attitude toward the
  proceedings</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">character or reputation</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">imposition of
  other penalties or sanctions</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>, and
  <span class="ABAstandard">remoteness of prior offenses</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the above findings and this court's prior jurisprudence, the board ordered that
  respondent be publicly reprimanded and be assessed with all costs of this proceeding.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC sought review of the board's ruling in this court pursuant to Supreme Court XIX, §
  11(G).<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a> We directed the parties to brief the matter and
  docketed the case for oral argument.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters fall under the original jurisdiction of this court. La.Const. art. V, §
  5(B). We act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the alleged
  misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94),
  <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v.
  Boutall, 597 So. 2d 444 (La. 1992)</span>. Although we generally accept the credibility evaluations made by the
  hearing committee members, we are in no way bound by these findings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">For purposes of the Bone matter, the critical issue the ODC must prove is whether respondent
  informed Mr. Bone prior to his guilty plea that there existed a letter of no comment from the district attorney's
  office. While the committee received a great deal of testimony on this issue, much of this testimony is based on
  second-hand information or speculation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The only persons who had direct knowledge of what respondent told Mr. Bone were Mr. Bone and
  respondent. Respondent testified at the disciplinary hearing that he told Mr. Bone he was confident he could obtain a
  no-comment letter, but denied informing Mr. Bone that such a letter existed. Although Mr. Bone testified at the
  post-conviction hearing that respondent advised him the no-comment letter existed prior to his guilty plea, the ODC
  did not produce Mr. Bone as a witness at the disciplinary hearing, making it difficult to evaluate his
  credibility.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The sole piece of objective evidence introduced by the ODC was the stipulation read into the
  record at the post-conviction hearing.<a name="fnref4" class="fn" href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a> Unfortunately, as the
  board points out, this stipulation is internally inconsistent. According to the stipulation, respondent thought he
  could obtain a no-comment letter "at the time of commutation." However, the stipulation also indicates that
  respondent told Mr. Bone and his mother both before and after the guilty plea that the letter "existed and was
  forthcoming . . . ." Given this internal inconsistency, we cannot say this stipulation represents clear and
  convincing evidence that respondent made promises to Mr. Bone in an effort to induce his guilty plea.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">We acknowledge that the testimony of Mr. Naquin and Ms. White could support a contrary
  conclusion. Nonetheless, as noted previously, these witnesses had no direct knowledge of the conversation that
  transpired between Mr. Bone and respondent. Their testimony represents their opinions or speculations as to what
  respondent may have said to Mr. Bone, but does not constitute clear and convincing evidence of what was said to Mr.
  Bone. In the absence of such clear and convincing evidence, we are constrained to find the ODC has not proven
  violations of Rules 1.1(a), 1.3, 3.3(a)(1), 3.3(a)(4), 3.4(b), 4.1, 4.4, 8.4(c) and 8.4(d).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Nonetheless, we find the evidence in the record is sufficient to support a finding that
  respondent failed to properly communicate with his client for purposes of Rule 1.4. Although respondent denied
  promising a favorable result to Mr. Bone, he admitted his statement that he was confident that he could obtain a
  no-comment letter had a great influence on Mr. Bone's decision to plead guilty. Much of the confusion in this case
  could have been eliminated if respondent had clearly and unambiguously communicated to Mr. Bone that he was in no way
  representing that Mr. Bone could obtain a favorable result in the future (commutation of his sentence) by entering
  the guilty plea. Therefore, based on respondent's own admissions, we find he violated Rule
  <span class="Rules">1.4</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">We further find respondent's DWI conviction constitutes a violation of Rule
  <span class="Rules">8.4(b)</span>. Although this was a misdemeanor conviction, it does not reflect well on
  respondent's trustworthiness or fitness to practice law, especially in light of the fact that his drinking problem
  may have contributed to his other misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found evidence of professional misconduct, we now turn to a determination of the
  appropriate sanction for respondent's actions. In considering that issue, we are mindful that disciplinary
  proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the
  profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis,
  <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's failure to adequately communicate with Mr. Bone placed an additional burden on the
  criminal justice system. His DWI conviction reflects adversely on his moral fitness.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Several mitigating factors are present, including remorse, lack of dishonest or selfish motive,
  and good character. The sole aggravating factors are respondent's substantial experience in the practice of law and
  his prior disciplinary record. We note, however, that the prior infractions are remote in time.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the record as a whole, we find a ninety-day suspension is the appropriate sanction
  for respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and the disciplinary
  board, and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is ordered that Henry J. Lafont, Jr., Louisiana Bar
  Roll number 8094, be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of ninety days. All costs and
  expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal
  interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4" class="fn" href="#fnref4" id="fn4">4</a> The ODC also introduced a tape
  recording of a conversation between Mrs. Bone and  respondent in which respondent indicated that he possessed the

  therefore has little probative value as to whether respondent advised Mr. Bone that the letter existed prior to Mr.
  Bone's guilty plea.</p>
