  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: BERNARD J. GRENROOD, JR.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ORDER</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") has filed three separate sets of formal charges
  against respondent, and three disciplinary investigations are currently pending. The formal charges allege that
  respondent charged an excessive legal fee, entered into a prohibited business transaction with a client, failed to
  timely pay a third-party medical provider, converted client and third-party funds, engaged in the unauthorized
  practice of law, engaged in dishonest and deceitful conduct, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation. The three matters still under investigation involve allegations of conflicts of interest, prohibited
  business transactions with clients, conversion of client funds, and dishonest and deceitful conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent now seeks to permanently resign from the practice of law in lieu of discipline. The
  ODC has concurred in respondent's petition.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having considered the Petition for Voluntary Permanent Resignation from the Practice of Law filed
  by Bernard J. Grenrood, Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 6308, and the concurrence thereto filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel,</p>

  discipline be and is hereby granted, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 20.1 and Rule 5.5(c) of the Rules of
