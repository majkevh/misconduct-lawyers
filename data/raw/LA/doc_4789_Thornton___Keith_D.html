  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 04-B-0488</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: KEITH D. THORNTON</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from two sets of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Keith D. Thornton, an attorney licensed to practice law in
  Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The underlying facts of these matters are not in dispute, having been stipulated to by the
  parties.</p>

  <h3>01-DB-092</h3>

  <h4>The Matthews Matter</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In April 2000, Natasha Matthews retained respondent to represent her in a paternity and child
  support matter, and paid the sum of $500 plus court costs. Respondent filed a petition on Ms. Matthews' behalf and
  subsequently obtained the appointment of a private process server; however, service was never made on the defendant
  because Ms. Matthews was unwilling to pay for additional service attempts. Respondent has not refunded any portion of
  the fee Ms. Matthews paid.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In August 2000, Ms. Matthews filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. Respondent
  answered the complaint in December 2000, following which the ODC requested additional information concerning the
  matter. Respondent failed to reply to the supplemental requests for information.</p>

  <h3>03-DB-007</h3>

  <h4>Count I - Failure to Cooperate</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In August 2001, Louis Lipinski filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On September
  25, 2001, and again on October 17, 2001, the ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail.
  Respondent failed to reply to the complaint, necessitating the issuance of a subpoena compelling him to appear and
  answer the complaint under oath.</p>

  <h4>Count II - The West Matter</h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Teresa West paid respondent $500 to represent her in a child support matter. Respondent filed a
  petition on Ms. West's behalf and obtained a hearing date, but the matter was passed by the court and no hearing was
  ever held. Respondent has taken no further steps to move Ms. West's matter forward, has not withdrawn as her counsel,
  and has not refunded any portion of the fee Ms. West paid.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In November 2001, Ms. West filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. Respondent failed
  to reply to the complaint, necessitating the issuance of a subpoena compelling him to appear on March 15, 2002 and
  answer the complaint under oath. Respondent did not appear on that date.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On September 6, 2001, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent in 01-DB-092,
  alleging that his conduct in the Matthews matter violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act
  with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to
  communicate with a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> (obligations upon termination of the
  representation), <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation),
  and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct. On November 16, 2001, upon respondent's failure to answer or otherwise reply to the formal
  charges, the factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence
  pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). No formal hearing was held, but the hearing committee considered
  written argument and documentary evidence submitted by the ODC on the issue of sanctions.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1"
  id="fnref1">1</a> On December 5, 2002, <a href="../HC/2002-12-05_01-DB-092.htm">the hearing committee</a> recommended
  that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for three months for his misconduct in the Matthews matter.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On January 29, 2003, prior to the disciplinary board's consideration of 01-DB-092, the ODC filed
  a second set of formal charges against respondent in 03-DB-007. In Count I of the second set of formal charges, the
  ODC alleged that respondent failed to cooperate in the investigation of the complaint filed by Mr. Lipinski, in
  violation of Rules 8.1(c) and 8.4(g) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. In Count II, the ODC alleged that
  respondent neglected Ms. West's legal matter, failed to communicate with his client, and failed to cooperate in the
  investigation of the complaint filed against him, in violation of Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span>,
  <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span>, <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span>, and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent answered the formal charges in 03-DB-007 and generally denied any misconduct. He then
  filed a motion to recall the deemed admitted order entered in 01-DB-092. On May 9, 2003, the disciplinary board
  granted respondent's motion and recalled the deemed admitted order. The board also consolidated the two sets of
  formal charges and remanded the consolidated matters for a hearing before a hearing committee.</p>

  <h3><a href="../HC/2003-08-19_01-DB-092.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the stipulated facts, and the testimony and documentary evidence presented at the
  hearing, the hearing committee determined that respondent neglected Ms. West's child support matter and failed to
  keep her reasonably informed about the status of her case. Respondent also failed to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation of the complaints filed by Ms. Matthews, Mr. Lipinski, and Ms. West. However, the committee did not
  find clear and convincing evidence of any substantive misconduct in connection with the Matthews matter. The baseline
  sanction for respondent's misconduct is a suspension from the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the committee recognized respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">prior
  disciplinary offenses</span> <a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a> and <span class="ABAstandard">multiple
  offenses</span>. The committee found no mitigating factors are present.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, the committee recommended that respondent be suspended from the
  practice of law for one year and one day, followed by a period of supervised probation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-02-25_01-DB-092.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board generally accepted the hearing committee's factual findings, and agreed
  that the committee properly applied the Rules of Professional Conduct. The board specifically noted its agreement
  that the ODC failed to prove any substantive misconduct arising out of the Matthews matter. Ms. Matthews' case did
  not move forward because she refused to pay for additional attempts to serve the petition on the defendant. Moreover,
  respondent was never terminated by Ms. Matthews, and she never requested a refund of the fee from him prior to the
  filing of her complaint. At the time of the hearing, Ms. Matthews' whereabouts were unknown. Based on this reasoning,
  the board determined that respondent did not violate Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 1.16(d) in connection with the Matthews
  matter.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board found respondent knowingly violated duties owed to his clients and to the profession.
  Respondent's conduct caused injury to Ms. West because her case was delayed, and his failure to cooperate with the
  ODC caused unnecessary depletion of the agency's resources in that additional investigative efforts were necessary.
  The board adopted the aggravating factors cited by the hearing committee, and also recognized respondent's
  substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted 1990). The board found no mitigating factors are present.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, and the prior jurisprudence of
  this court, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year and one day,
  followed by a period of supervised probation. The board also recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs
  and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of
  the court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The joint stipulation of facts submitted by the parties establishes that respondent neglected a
  legal matter and failed to communicate with his client. He also failed to cooperate with the ODC in three separate
  disciplinary investigations. Therefore, the sole issue presented for our consideration is the appropriate sanction
  for respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed
  to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future
  misconduct. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d
  1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of
  the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a>
  (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent knowingly violated duties owed to his client, Ms. West, when he neglected her child
  custody matter and failed to keep her informed of the status of her case. Respondent's actions caused Ms. West's
  legal matter to be delayed. Moreover, respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of three
  complaints filed against him. The baseline sanction for such misconduct is a suspension from the practice of law.
  See, e.g., <span class="cite">In re: Karam, 03-0755 (La. 6/27/03), <a href="2003-06-27_2003-0755.htm">852 So. 2d
  979</a></span>; <span class="cite">In re: Bonnette, 01-1401 (La. 6/29/01), <a href="2001-06-29_2001-1401.htm">791 So.
  2d 68</a></span>; <span class="cite">In re: Smith, 00-2627 (La. 11/27/00), <a href="2000-11-27_2000-2627.htm">775 So.
  2d 1</a></span>. In light of the aggravating factors found by the board to be applicable in this case, and
  considering the absence of any factors in mitigation, we conclude that a one year and one day suspension is necessary
  to protect the public, the legal system, and the profession.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board's recommendation of
  discipline.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Keith D. Thornton, Louisiana Bar Roll number 20392, be suspended from
  the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of one year and one day. All costs and expenses in the matter are
  assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty
  days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> Respondent filed nothing for the hearing
  committee's consideration.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">2</a> In 2000, respondent was admonished by the

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3" id="fn3">3</a> The hearing committee and disciplinary board both
  recommended that respondent's suspension be followed by a period of supervised probation with conditions. However,

  reinstatement. See <span class="cite">In re: Welcome, 02-2662 (La. 1/24/03), <a href="2003-01-24_2002-2662.htm">840
