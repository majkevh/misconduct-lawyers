  <p class='headingstyle'>SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p><p class='headingstyle'>NO: 94-DB-2245</p><p class='headingstyle'>IN RE: J. KEITH MULLINS</p><p class='headingstyle'>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p><p class='signature'>PER CURIAM <sup><a name="fnref1" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

  <p class='Bodycopy'>This is a disciplinary proceeding against the respondent, James Keith Mullins, a member of the
  Louisiana State Bar Association, based on, among other things his criminal conviction of a serious crime under
  Section 19(B) of Supreme Court Rule <span>XIX</span>. <span class="cite"><a href="../DB/1994-08-30_93-DB-023.htm">The
  Disciplinary Board</a></span>, after reviewing the evidence presented to the
  <span class="cite"><a href="../HC/1994-03-24_93-DB-023.htm">Hearing Committee</a></span>, issued a report
  recommending that the Respondent be disbarred from the practice of law. Respondent objected to the Board's
  recommendation, and that matter is now before this Court under our original jurisdiction. La Const. Art V, Sec
  5(B).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Robert Alonzo had  retained Respondent  for purposes of appealing his criminal conviction,
  specifically the denial of a motion to suppress evidence. Respondent filed a notice of appeal but failed to assign
  the motion to suppress as error. Subsequently, Mr. Alonzo terminated his relationship with Respondent and requested
  that Respondent provide an accounting of the services rendered and return the unearned portion of his advance fee. On
  April 26, 12991, Mr. Alonzo filed a complaint with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and related that he had not
  received an accounting despite a second written request..</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On October 29, 1991, Respondent was personally served with a subpoena ordering him to appear
  before Disciplinary Counsel on November 1,1991 to testify about the Alonzo matter. He was also served with a subpeona
  duces tecum requesting production of all invoices and financial records pertinent  to the investigation. Respondent
  did not appear and both subpeonas were continued to November 26, 1991. Respondent did appear on November 26, 1991,
  but failed to produce the requested invoices and financial records to the disciplinary authority.</p>

  <p class='Bodycopy'>On July 1, 1993, two counts of formal charges were filed against Respondent. The first count was
  brought for violation of Rules <span class="Rules">1.1</span> <span class="Rules">1.2(a)</span>,
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4</span>, <span class="Rules">1.5(f)</span>,
  <span class="Rules">1.15</span>, <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span> and <span class="Rules">8.4 (a)(b)&amp;(c)</span>
  of the Rules of Professional Conduct resulting from Respondent's failure to include a major issue on appeal, failure
  to accurately account to Mr. Alonzo for the earned portion of his advance fee after discharge, and failure to place
  the disputed portion of the advance fee in a trust account after the dispute arose with Mr. Alonzo. The second count
  formally charged Respondent with failing to cooperate and obstructing access to evidence in a disciplinary
  investigation, and engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rules
  <span class="Rules">3.4(a)(c)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.1(b)(c)</span>, and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(a)(d)&amp;(g)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct and Section 9(c) of  Supreme Court
  Rule XIX.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On August 18, 1993, additional formal charges were filed against Respondent arising from a
  criminal conviction of a serious offense which constituted a violation of Rule 8.4(b) of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct and which adversely reflected upon his moral fitness to practice law under Section 19(B) of Supreme Court
  Rule XIX. The documentary evidence established that on May 28, 1993, Respondent entered a guilty plea in the United
  States District Court, Western District of Louisiana, to the felony crime of possession with intent  to distribute
  marijuana in violation of  21 U.S.C. Section 841(a)(1). As a result, Respondent was sentenced to three years
  imprisonment. <span class="BodyText2">On August 13, 1993, this Court, given the criminal conviction, ordered that
  Respondent be placed on interim suspension</span> in accordance with Section 19 of Supreme Court Rule XIX. See,
  <span class="CITE"><i>In re: James Keith Mullins</i>, 663 So.2d 1282 (La.1983).</span></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On October 18, 1993, the Hearing Committee Chair ordered that it was not necessary to conduct a
  hearing because Mullins had failed to respond to any of the formal charges and thus, they were deemed admitted
  pursuant to Section 11E(3) of Supreme Court Rule XIX. Moreover, Respondent had neglected to submit documentary
  evidence and written argument for consideration to the Committee after being afforded the opportunity to do so.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the documentary evidence and written arguments submitted by Disciplinary Counsel,
  the Hearing Committee concluded Respondent's criminal conviction adversely reflected upon his moral fitness to
  practice law and warranted the baseline sanction of disbarment<sup>. <a name="fnref2" href="#fn2"
  id="fnref2">2</a></sup>. Its determination was prompted by the Committee's finding of aggravating factors of a prior
  disciplinary record <sup><a name="fnref3" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> and  failure to cooperate in a
  disciplinary investigation. See, American Bar Association's Standards for Imposing Sanctions. Standard 9.22(a)
  &amp;(e).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In accordance with Section 11(F) of Supreme Court Rule XIX, the Hearing Committee submitted its
  findings and report to the Disciplinary Board. The Committee recommended disbarment effective the date of
  Respondent's interim suspension.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Disciplinary Board, after consideration of the evidence presented to the Hearing Committee,
  adopted the findings of the Committee. In doing so, the Board stated the Respondent's drug conviction alone warranted
  a sanction of disbarment. The Board further held Respondent's failure to vigorously and competently represent Mr.
  Alonzo in the criminal appeal of his conviction and Respondent's failure to fully comply with the subpoena issued to
  him by the disciplinary authority were also serious matters contributing to disbarment. Like the Hearing Committee,
  the Board noted the record lacked the evidence of mitigating factors because of Respondent's neglect. However, the
  Board found several aggravating factors to be present that were not addressed by the Hearing Committee<sup>.
  <a name="fnref4" href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup> The Board issued a report to this Court recommending disbarment
  effective the date of the interim suspension and assessment of all costs of the disciplinary proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the record of the <a href="../DB/1994-08-30_93-DB-023.htm">Disciplinary
  Board's</a> findings and recommendations, and considering the record, briefs and oral arguments, we conclude that the
  charges of misconduct are supported by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In Re
  Q</span><span class="CITE">uaid, 94-1316 (LA. 11/30/94);<a target="main" href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So.2d
  343</a></span>. It is the decision of this Court that the Disciplinary Board's recommendations be adopted.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, it is ordered that the name James Keith Mullins be stricken from the roll of
  attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked effective August 13, 1993, the
  date of his interim suspension. All costs of these proceedings are assessed to Respondent. See, Section 10(A(7) of
  Supreme Court Rule XIX.</p>
