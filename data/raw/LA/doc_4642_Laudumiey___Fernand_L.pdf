<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">and</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">DENNIS S. MANN</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">&nbsp;ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

<p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

<p class="bodycopy">This disciplinary matter involves consolidated charges instituted against respondents, Fernand L. Laudumiey, III and Dennis S. Mann, two attorneys who are licensed to practice law in Louisiana, but currently on interim suspension.</p>

<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

<h3>Factual Background</h3>

<p class="bodycopy">In 1996, respondents entered into an employment arrangement with Ernest Aiavolasiti and Michael Palmisano, two non-attorney &quot;legal assistants&quot; who had been previously employed by another law firm.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" id="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>&nbsp; Mr. 
Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano indicated they had personal contact with their former firm's clients and felt that many of the clients would follow them after their departure from the firm.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">At the suggestion of Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano, respondents set up a law office on Canal Street in the City of New Orleans.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" id="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&nbsp; Respondents gave Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano full responsibility and 
unfettered discretion to set up the office, and to handle all administrative matters and case acquisitions, development, and settlements.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">In the first year, respondents put up approximately $270,000 of their own funds to finance the firm's operating account.&nbsp; Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano had complete access to these funds.&nbsp; When the funds were exhausted after the first six months of the new firm's 
existence, respondents set up a $150,000 line of credit with a bank to finance the operation.&nbsp; Respondents did not monitor how the funds were being spent.&nbsp; It later turned out these funds were being used by Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano, with respondents' knowledge, to pay &quot;runners,&quot; 
persons&nbsp; who were used to solicit personal injury clients for the firm.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">During the same time, Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano provided a quick &quot;transition&quot; of approximately 800 to 1,000 client files from their prior employer to respondents' firm.&nbsp; These clients never met respondents, and communicated exclusively with Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. 
Palmisano.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Eighteen months after its opening, respondents closed the Canal Street office based on concerns that the firm was not generating sufficient revenues.&nbsp; Respondents also began to experience trepidation about their arrangement with Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano, as an 
insurance company had begun to question clients during depositions about how they came to be represented by respondents.&nbsp; After the Canal Street office closed, respondents had no further contact with Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano.</p>

<h3>Federal Investigation</h3>

<p class="bodycopy">Unbeknownst to respondents, Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano began cooperating with federal authorities who were investigating the practice of runner-based solicitation.&nbsp; In connection with this investigation, Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano agreed to meet with 
respondents while wearing hidden recording&nbsp; devices.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" id="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>&nbsp; Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano advised respondents that they had been subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury in connection with an FBI investigation.&nbsp; 
Respondents attempted to persuade Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano to testify that respondents did not know Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano were paying runners.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" id="_ftnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>&nbsp; After the meeting, respondents gave Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. 
Palmisano $2,000 in cash to retain counsel and advised more funds were available.</p>

<h3>Federal Criminal Proceedings</h3>

<p class="bodycopy">As a result of the information developed in the federal investigation, respondents were indicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana on one count of obstruction of justice, a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1512(b)(1)(2).&nbsp; The indictment 
alleged respondents &quot;did knowingly and intentionally corruptly persuade and attempt to persuade [Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano] with intent to influence their testimony in an official proceeding. . . .&quot;&nbsp; In March 2001, respondents pled guilty to the charges.&nbsp; In the factual basis for 
the guilty plea, respondents admitted that they had &quot;full knowledge&quot; that Mr. Aiavolasiti and Mr. Palmisano used runners to solicit personal injury clients while employed by respondents.</p>

<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

<h3>Interim Suspension</h3>

<p class="bodycopy">Following their guilty pleas, respondents and the ODC filed a joint motion in this court requesting that respondents be placed on interim suspension.&nbsp; On April 11, 2001, we placed respondents on interim suspension and ordered that disciplinary proceedings be instituted.
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Laudumiey</i>, 01-0925 (La. 4/11/01), 787 So. 2d 275</span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Mann,</i> 01-0926 (La. 4/11/01), 787 So. 2d 275.</span></p>

<h3>Formal Charges</h3>

<p class="bodycopy">On July 23, 2001, the ODC filed identical sets of formal charges against both respondents.&nbsp; The formal charges set forth the facts underlying respondents' convictions, but did not set forth any specific rule violations. On August 22, 2001, the ODC filed a &quot;first 
supplemental and amending formal charge&quot; against respondents, which alleged respondents' criminal conviction constituted a violation of Rule 8.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" id="_ftnref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> and warranted their &quot;permanent disbarment from the 
practice of law.&quot;</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Respondents' declinatory and peremptory exceptions asserting numerous due process violations were overruled.&nbsp; Subsequently, their disciplinary proceedings were consolidated and respondents filed admissions to the allegations of professional misconduct.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bodycopy">A formal hearing was conducted before the committee.&nbsp; Respondents testified at the hearing and presented mitigating evidence.</p>

<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-077.HC --#">Recommendation of the Hearing Committee</a></h3>

<p class="bodycopy">The hearing committee found the ODC proved by clear and convincing evidence respondents violated Rule 8.4(b) based on their commission of a criminal act adversely reflecting on their honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as lawyers.&nbsp; The committee further found the crime of 
which they were convicted was a &quot;serious crime&quot; for purposes of Supreme Court Rule XIX &sect; 19(B).</p>

<p class="bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the committee recognized respondents' <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">refusal to acknowledge 
the wrongful nature of the conduct</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" id="_ftnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>&nbsp; Also, specifically with regard to respondent Mann, the committee noted <span class="ABAstandard">prior 
disciplinary offenses</span>.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" id="_ftnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class="bodycopy">In mitigation, the committee recognized <span class="ABAstandard">character or reputation</span> and, in the case of respondent Laudumiey, the <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>.&nbsp; However, the committee specifically declined to find 
remorse as a mitigating factor, stating:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Respondents knowingly entered into an enterprise with non-lawyers to solicit personal injury cases for personal gain.&nbsp; They gave unfettered discretion to individuals who were not lawyers and essentially gave them a blank check to run the operation.&nbsp; Little control or supervision was 
offered and the non-lawyers answered only to themselves.&nbsp; To suggest that two lawyers with more than twenty years of experience respectively should have known better is an understatement.&nbsp; Financial gain appears to be the underlying motivation.&nbsp; To be remorseful at this time because 
one has been caught is of little consequence.&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>


<p class="bodycopy">Based on these factors, the committee recommended respondents be permanently disbarred from the practice of law.</p>

<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-078.BD --#">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></h3>

<p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board adopted the committee's findings of fact and conclusion that respondents violated Rule <span class="Rules">8.4(b)</span>.&nbsp; The board noted that respondents breached duties owed to the public, resulting in actual injury to the legal profession.&nbsp; 
Relying on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> and jurisprudence from this court, the committee concluded the appropriate baseline sanction for respondents' misconduct is disbarment.&nbsp; Applying the aggravating and mitigating factors cited by the committee, and relying on the 
Guidelines for Imposition of Permanent Disbarment set forth in Appendix E to Supreme Court Rule XIX, the board unanimously recommended respondents be permanently disbarred from the practice of law.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Respondents filed objections to the board's findings and the severity of the proposed sanctions, and reasserted their due process claims.&nbsp; Accordingly, the court docketed the matter for briefing and argument in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 11(G)(1)(b).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>&nbsp;DISCUSSION</h2>

<p class="bodycopy">In their brief and argument to this court, respondents raise two procedural objections to the disciplinary board's recommendation of permanent disbarment.&nbsp; First, they contend the amendments to Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10(A)<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" id="_ftnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> 
and &sect; 24(A),<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" id="_ftnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> which provide for the sanction of permanent disbarment, may not be applied to their conduct in this case, as their conduct occurred prior to the August 1, 2001 effective date of the amendments.&nbsp; Second, they assert 
that the lawyer disciplinary system set forth in Supreme Court Rule XIX is unconstitutional.&nbsp; We will address these arguments separately.</p>

<h3>Application of&nbsp; Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10 and &sect; 24&nbsp; to Conduct Occurring Prior to August 1, 2001</h3>

<p class="bodycopy">&nbsp; In <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Ruffalo</i>, 390 U.S. 544, 550 (1968)</span>, the United States Supreme Court held that a lawyer facing discipline is &quot;entitled to procedural due process, which includes fair notice of the charge.&quot;&nbsp; A review of the record in the instant 
case leaves no doubt that respondents were given fair notice that the ODC intended to seek to have them disbarred on a permanent basis.&nbsp; The ODC filed formal charges against respondents in July 2001.&nbsp; On August 1, 2001, we adopted amendments to Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10 and &sect; 24 which 
provide for permanent disbarment.&nbsp; Shortly after we adopted those amendments, the ODC filed a &quot;first supplemental and amending charge&quot; alleging that respondents' conduct warranted&nbsp; permanent disbarment from the practice of law. This amended charge was filed well in advance of 
the formal hearing.&nbsp; Respondents concede they had an adequate opportunity to present any appropriate mitigating evidence and to argue against imposition of permanent disbarment.&nbsp; Accordingly, we find no infringement of respondents' due process rights in these proceedings.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Nonetheless, respondents insist that application of the permanent disbarment amendments to conduct which occurred prior to the effective date of those amendments would be a violation of their substantive due process rights.&nbsp; In essence, respondents submit that if these 
amendments are applied to pre-amendment conduct, the amendments would violate the prohibition on <i>ex post facto</i> laws found in Article I, &sect; 10 of the United States Constitution and Article I, &sect; 23 of the Louisiana Constitution.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">We conclude nothing in Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10 and &sect; 24 has an <i>ex post facto</i> effect on respondents' case.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" id="_ftnref10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>&nbsp; In <span class="CITE"><i>State v. Everett</i>, 00-2998 (La. 5/14/02), 816 So. 2d 1272</span>, 
this court explained the focus of the <i>ex post facto</i> analysis is whether the new law redefines conduct or increases the penalty by which the conduct is punishable:</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Art. I, &sect; 10 of the United States Constitution and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 prohibit ex post facto application of the criminal law by the State.&nbsp; The focus of the ex post facto inquiry is whether a new law redefines criminal conduct or increases the penalty by which the crime 
is punishable.&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>State v. Williams</i>, 00-1725 (La. 11/28/01), 800 So.2d 790</span>; <span class="CITE"><i>State ex rel. Olivieri v. State</i>, 00-0172 (La. 2/21/01), 779 So.2d 735, <i>cert. denied</i>, 533 U.S. 936, 121 S.Ct. 2566, 150 L.Ed.2d 730 (2001)</span>.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Obviously, the amendments to Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10 and &sect; 24 do not redefine&nbsp; respondents' conduct, which remains controlled by the Rules of Professional Conduct in effect at the time of their offense.&nbsp; However, respondents contend that the amendments have the 
effect of increasing the penalty they may receive for their misconduct.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">The fallacy in respondents' argument is that nothing in the amendments to Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10 and &sect; 24 altered the penalties a lawyer may receive for professional misconduct.&nbsp; Both prior to and after the amendment, the most serious sanction a lawyer may receive 
under Rule XIX is the sanction of disbarment.&nbsp; The only change effected by the amendments relates to the ability of a disbarred attorney to seek readmission.&nbsp; However, respondents maintain that the elimination of this &quot;right&quot; to seek readmission exposes them to a greater sanction than they 
could have received at the time of their misconduct.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" id="_ftnref11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class="bodycopy">&nbsp; Respondents have pointed to no constitutional authority or jurisprudence from this court which would indicate a disbarred attorney has a &quot;right&quot; to seek readmission to the bar of this state.&nbsp; The five-year minimum period for seeking readmission, as set forth in 
Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 24, is a rule of procedure that does not vest any substantive rights in the attorney.&nbsp; The procedural nature of the rule is illustrated by our decisions in <span class="CITE"><i>In re: White</i>, 00-2732 (La. 4/25/01), <a href="#!-- #ID:791 So.2d 602 --#">791 So. 2d 
602</a></span>, and&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Krasnoff</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:502 So.2d 1018 --#">502 So. 2d 1018</a> (La. 1987)</span>, in which we held that the minimum period for applying for readmission may be extended or otherwise modified at our discretion.&nbsp; 
Thus, it is clear that our rules create no substantive right to seek readmission.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Our authority to regulate readmission to the bar is a fundamental component in the exercise of our plenary power over the practice of law.&nbsp; La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(B);&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>Chittenden v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.</i>, 00-0414 (La. 5/15/01), 788 So. 
2d 1140</span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Bar Exam Class Action</i>, 99-2880 (La. 2/18/00), 752 So. 2d 159</span>; <span class="CITE"><i>Succession of Wallace</i>, 574 So. 2d 348 (La. 1991)</span>.&nbsp; Given this court's absolute discretion over readmission, it is beyond dispute that this court 
has always had the unfettered authority to refuse readmission to disbarred attorneys, including the right to do so on a permanent basis.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Thus, it is clear the amendments to Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10(A) and &sect; 24(A) do not represent a substantive change to the bar disciplinary rules, nor do they result in the adoption of a new sanction which did not previously exist.&nbsp; Rather, these amendments simply 
represent a procedural change to Supreme Court Rule XIX in order to recognize a power this court has always possessed.&nbsp; <i>See</i> <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Gremillion</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:320 So.2d 171 --#">320 So. 2d 171</a>, 174 (La. 1975)</span> (amendment to bar 
disciplinary rules occurring after respondent's conduct &quot;changed no substantive rights of respondent; it only provided a better procedural method to handle disciplinary actions.&quot;).</p>

<p class="bodycopy">The procedural nature of the amendments is made clear by the language of Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10(A), which provides &quot;the court <i>retains</i> the discretion to permanently disbar the lawyer and permanently prohibit any such lawyer from being readmitted to the practice of 
law.&quot; [emphasis added].&nbsp; Likewise, we made this reasoning clear in our commentary accompanying the amendment:</p>

<p class="bodycopy">In the public interest, the Court has amended Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX to codify Permanent Disbarment as an available sanction for attorney misconduct. While the Court has always had the discretion to deny an application for readmission after the requisite five (5)-year 
waiting period after disbarment, an attorney who is permanently disbarred under these circumstances will be prohibited from applying for readmission to the bar. These amendments reflect the judgment of the Court that in some instances lawyer misconduct may be so egregious as to warrant a sanction of 
permanent disbarment based on the facts of an individual case and in consideration of the guidelines in Appendix E to the Rules of Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">In sum, we hold that the amendments to Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10(A) and &sect; 24(A) do not create a new penalty.&nbsp; Accordingly, we conclude there is no merit to respondents' argument that these amendments constitute prohibited <i>ex post facto</i> laws.</p>

<h3>Constitutionality of Supreme Court Rule XIX</h3>

<p class="bodycopy">Respondents next raise a constitutional challenge to the entire lawyer disciplinary system as set forth in Supreme Court Rule XIX.&nbsp; They contend the rule is unconstitutional because it improperly delegates the original jurisdiction of this court to non-judges on the hearing 
committee and disciplinary board, thereby depriving them of access to the courts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bodycopy">La. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(B) provides this court has &quot;exclusive original jurisdiction of disciplinary proceedings against a member of the bar.&quot;&nbsp; In exercising this jurisdiction, we have held it is within our authority to appoint a commissioner to report findings and 
recommendations of discipline to this court.&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Sackett</i>, 231 La. 655, <a href="#!-- #ID:92 So.2d 571 --#">92 So. 2d 571</a> (1957)</span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Mundy</i>, 182 La. 148, 161 So. 184 (1935)</span>.&nbsp; While the scheme 
of Supreme Court Rule XIX provides for a system of hearing committees and a disciplinary board, there is no fundamental difference between this system and the commissioner system which we upheld in <i>Sackett</i> and <i>Mundy</i>.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" id="_ftnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class="bodycopy">Despite respondents' arguments to the contrary, Supreme Court Rule XIX does not delegate our original jurisdiction over disciplinary proceedings to the hearing committees and the disciplinary board.&nbsp; Regardless of the recommendation of the disciplinary board, &quot;it is the 
ultimate duty of this court to determine under the broad discretion vested in it what action, if any is to be taken against an attorney charged with misconduct. . . .&quot;&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Wheeler</i>, 243 La. 618, <a href="#!-- #ID:145 So.2d 774 --#">145 So. 2d 
774</a>, 777 (1962)</span>.&nbsp; When we consider a disciplinary case, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence.&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 
11/30/94), <a href="#!-- #ID:646 So.2d 343 --#">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 348</span>; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:597 So.2d 444 --#">597 So. 2d&nbsp; 444</a>, 445 (La. 1992)</span>.&nbsp; Accordingly, we find nothing in Supreme Court Rule XIX which 
contradicts the constitutional grant of original jurisdiction in bar disciplinary cases to this court.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Respondents next argue the system created under Supreme Court Rule XIX is flawed because there is no separation between the prosecutorial and adjudicative functions in the&nbsp; disciplinary system.&nbsp; In support, respondents point out that this court appoints the disciplinary 
board, which in turn appoints the disciplinary counsel, subject to the approval of this court.&nbsp; According to respondents, this link between the court, the disciplinary board, and the disciplinary counsel results in a merging of the prosecutorial and adjudicative functions.<a href="#_ftn13" 
name="_ftnref13" id="_ftnref13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class="bodycopy">In <span class="CITE"><i>Allen v. State Board of Dentistry</i>, 543 So. 2d 908 (La. 1989)</span>, we held that a system whereby the prosecutor of a state board drafted the board's findings of fact&nbsp; violated due process because it represented a commingling of prosecutorial 
and adjudicative functions in a single person.&nbsp; Nothing in Supreme Court Rule XIX creates such an impermissible commingling of functions.&nbsp; While the disciplinary board performs both an adjudicative and prosecutorial function, these functions are separated within the board.&nbsp; Supreme 
Court Rule XIX, &sect; 2(A).<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" id="_ftnref14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>&nbsp; The rule clearly delineates the functions of the disciplinary board and the disciplinary counsel, avoiding the commingling of functions in a single person which we found objectionable in <i>Allen</i>.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Respondents' arguments relating to the role of this court in the process are also not well founded.&nbsp; As explained previously, the constitution grants this court&nbsp; exclusive original jurisdiction over disciplinary proceedings.&nbsp; The procedures we have enacted under 
Supreme Court Rule XIX foster the exercise of this jurisdiction and avoid any unfairness to the respondent lawyer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bodycopy">In sum, we do not find Supreme Court Rule XIX is in violation of any constitutional provisions.&nbsp; Accordingly, respondents' arguments on this ground are without merit.</p>

<h3>Determination of Misconduct and Appropriate Discipline</h3>

<p class="bodycopy">The charges against respondents are based on their pleas of guilty to the crime of obstruction of justice in violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1512(b)(1)(2).&nbsp; In an attorney disciplinary proceeding based on the lawyer's criminal conviction, the issue of his guilt may not be 
relitigated.&nbsp; Because the lawyer's conviction, whether based on adjudication or guilty plea, is tantamount to a finding of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the clear and convincing standard of proof that applies to disciplinary proceedings has already been satisfied.&nbsp;
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Bankston</i>, 01-2780 (La. 3/8/02), <a href="#!-- #ID:810 So.2d 1113 --#">810 So. 2d 1113</a>;</span> <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Wilkinson</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:562 So.2d 902 --#">562 So. 2d 902</a> (La. 1990)</span>.&nbsp; In this type of 
proceeding, the sole&nbsp; issue to be determined is whether the crime warrants discipline and, if so, the extent thereof. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n. Frank</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:472 So.2d 1 --#">472 So. 2d 1</a> (La. 1985)</span>.&nbsp; The discipline to be imposed 
depends on the seriousness of the offense, the circumstances of the offense, and the extent of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Brumfield</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:449 So.2d 1017 --#">449 So. 2d 1017</a> (La. 1984)</span>. Clearly, the crime 
to which respondents pled guilty, obstruction of justice, is a very serious offense.&nbsp; This court has not hesitated to disbar attorneys convicted of similar crimes which relate&nbsp; to the integrity of the judicial process.&nbsp; <i>See</i> <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Mithun</i>, 00-3174 (La. 
1/5/01), <a href="#!-- #ID:776 So.2d 426 --#">776 So. 2d 426</a></span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Hingle</i>, 98-0774 (La. 9/18/98), <a href="#!-- #ID:717 So.2d 636 --#">717 So. 2d 636</a>;</span> <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Fabacher</i>, 94-0731 (La. 12/9/94),
<a href="#!-- #ID:646 So.2d 915 --#">646 So. 2d 915</a>;</span> <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Pitard</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:462 So.2d 178 --#">462 So. 2d 178</a> (La. 1985)</span>; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Adams</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:363 So.2d 418 --#">
363 So. 2d 418</a> (La. 1978)</span>. Respondents' convictions are particularly egregious because the investigation they sought to impede related directly to runner-based solicitation in the legal profession.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, the only appropriate sanction for their 
misconduct is disbarment.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Having determined respondents must be disbarred, the only remaining question is whether the nature of respondents' conduct is so reprehensible as to prohibit&nbsp; them from being&nbsp; readmitted to the practice of law.&nbsp; In Appendix E to Supreme Court Rule XIX, we provided 
guidelines illustrating the types of conduct which might result in permanent disbarment.&nbsp; Guideline 2 applies to &quot;[i]ntentional corruption of the judicial process, including but not limited to bribery, perjury and subornation of perjury.&quot;</p>

Supreme Court Rule XVII, &sect;&nbsp; 3(C).&nbsp; Respondents have blatantly disregarded and ignored the obligations they assumed when they took the oath as members of the bar of this state.&nbsp; In the face of this indisputable evidence of a fundamental lack of moral fitness, we can conceive of no 
circumstance under which we would grant readmission to respondents.&nbsp; Accordingly, they must be permanently disbarred.</p>

<h2>DECREE</h2>

<p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is ordered that the names of Fernand L. Laudumiey, III, Louisiana Bar Roll number 8126, and Dennis S. Mann, Louisiana Bar 
Roll number 9095, be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that their licenses to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked.&nbsp; Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 24(A), it is further ordered that respondents be permanently prohibited from being readmitted to the practice of law in 
this state.&nbsp; All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondents in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
