<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">LOUISIANA ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: EDWIN DEAUNDRA HAWKINS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 01-DB-049</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a Petition for Consent 
Discipline ("Petition") by Edwin DeAundra Hawkins ("Respondent") of New Orleans, Louisiana. The 
Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") has concurred in the Petition. Formal charges have been filed 
in this matter. The Petition contains misconduct involving lack of diligence, failure to communicate 
with clients, and failure to cooperate in disciplinary investigations. The Petition recommends a 
public reprimand with conditions. For reasons stated below, the Disciplinary Board accepts the 
petition and orders a public reprimand with conditions be issued against Respondent.</p>
<h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">On May 14, 2001, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") filed formal charges 
consisting of four counts of alleged misconduct against Respondent, with service effected on May 16, 
2001. Thereafter, on June 4, 2001, Respondent filed a motion for extension of time to answer. Mr. 
William D. Aaron, chair of Hearing Committee Number Forty, granted Respondent's motion on June 8, 
2001, giving Respondent until July 5, 2001 to file an answer to the formal charges.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon Respondent's failure to comply with this deadline, on July 16, 2001, ODC 
filed a motion to have the factual allegations contained in the formal charges deemed proven. Mr. 
Jacob Taranto III, chair of Hearing Committee Number Twenty-three, granted this motion on July 24, 
2001, giving Respondent twenty days in which to file a motion to have the deemed-admitted order 
recalled. On July 25, 2001, Mr. Edward Hebert II filed a motion to enroll as counsel of record for 
Respondent.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On November 1, 2001, Respondent filed a petition for consent discipline, in 
which Respondent admitted to violations of Rules 1.3,<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> 1.4(a),<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> 
8.1(c),<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> and 8.4(g)<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct. For this misconduct, Respondent proposes that he receive a public reprimand 
with the following conditions to be satisfied within the next year: (1) that he attend and complete 
the Ethics School presented by the Louisiana State Bar Association, (2) that he earn an additional 
six hours of Continuing Legal Education credits in the area of law office practice, and (3) that he 
attend a program presented by the Loss Prevention Counsel for the Louisiana State Bar Association.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On November 1, 2001, ODC filed its concurrence in the petition and a memorandum 
in support of the proposed sanction. On that same day, the parties filed a joint stipulation of 
facts. On February 21, 2002, a panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed the documents filed in this 
matter and conducted oral arguments. Deputy Disciplinary Counsel James T. Daly represented ODC; 
Respondent appeared and was represented by Mr. Hebert.</p>
<h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The pertinent parts of the formal charges filed in this matter read as follows:</p>
  <h3>COUNT I</h3>
  <p>EDWIN DeAUNDRA HAWKINS is a Louisiana licensed attorney who is eligible to practice law. The 
  Office of the Disciplinary Counsel received a Complaint from Nelson Tippen, Sr., which was opened 
  as investigative matter 0009382. Mr. Tippen complains that after hiring the Respondent to 
  represent his son in an appeal of his criminal conviction he has been unable to communicate with 
  the Respondent, that no work has been done, and he has not gotten his file back or fee refunded. 
  The Respondent has not cooperated with this investigation and has been very difficult to locate. 
  The actions of the Respondent constitute violations of Rules 
	<span class="allegedrules">1.3</span>, <span class="allegedrules">1.4(a)</span>, 
	<span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span>,<a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> 
  <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span>, and<span class="allegedrules"> 8.4(g)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
  <h3>COUNT II</h3>
  <p>Complainant, Lamar Lundy, alleges in his complaint that he retained the Respondent to represent 
  him in a criminal matter, but that he has had little communication with Respondent and nothing has 
  been done in his representation. This matter was opened as investigative matter 0009809. The 
  Respondent has been difficult to locate due to his not keeping his address current with the bar 
  association and he has not been cooperative in this investigation. The actions of the Respondent 
  constitute violations of Rules 1.3, 1.4(a), 8.1(c), and 8.4(g) of the Rules of Professional 
  Conduct.</p>
  <h3>COUNT III</h3>
  <p>Investigative matter 0009831 was opened on the complaint of Jovan Turner, who complained that 
  after hiring the Respondent, she could never communicate with him to find out the status of her 
  case. In this matter also, the Respondent has been uncooperative and difficult to locate. The 
  actions of the Respondent constitute violations of Rules 1.4(a), 8.1(c), and 8.4(g) of the Rules 
  of Professional Conduct.</p>
  <h3>COUNT IV</h3>
  <p>Investigative matter 0010641 was opened on the complaint of Shanika Brown, who hired him for a 
  tort case. Complainant states that she had little communication with Respondent about her case, 
  and that he did nothing in his representation of her. Respondent withdrew from this representation 
  without taking appropriate steps to safeguard his client's interests. The actions of Respondent 
  constitute violations of Rules 1.3, 1.4(a), and 1.16(d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
  <h3>STIPULATION OF FACTS</h3>
  <p>The stipulation of facts filed in this matter provides the following information:</p>
  <h4>1. (Investigative File No. 0009382)</h4>
  <p>Nelson Tippen, Sr., hired the Respondent to represent his son in an appeal of a criminal 
  conviction. The Respondent did not keep his client adequately informed and did not complete the 
  appeal. During the course of the investigation of the complaint, the Respondent did not fully 
  cooperate with the Office of the Disciplinary Counsel.</p>
  <h4>2. (Investigative File No. 0009809)</h4>
  <p>Lamar Lundy hired the Respondent to represent him in a criminal matter, but there was little 
  communication from the Respondent and little work done toward the representation. The Respondent 
  was not fully cooperative in the investigation of this complaint.</p>
  <h4>3. (Investigative File No. 0009831)</h4>
  <p>Jovan Turner hired the Respondent to represent her in a civil matter, but had difficulty 
  communicating with him. During the course of the investigation, the Respondent was not fully 
  cooperative with the Office of the Disciplinary Counsel.</p>
  <h4>4. (Investigative File No. 0010641)</h4>
  <p>Shanika Brown hired the Respondent to represent her in a tort case, but had little 
  communication from him about her case. Respondent did little toward her representation in the 
  matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rules
<span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span>, 
and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span>&nbsp; of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The Board must 
accept that Respondent has violated these rules. <span class="CITE"><i>In re Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 
(La. 6/7/96); <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=675%20So.2d%20272$t=document-frameset.htm" >675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given the 
violations of these rules, the Board is left to determine if the proposed sanction of public 
reprimand with conditions is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a 
sanction after a finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following 
factors:</p>
<ol>
  <li>whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, 
  or to the profession;</li>
  <li>whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</li>
  <li>the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</li>
  <li>the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on a review of the record and the stipulation of facts provided by the 
parties, the Board finds that Respondent has violated duties owed to his clients and to the legal 
profession. In its memorandum, ODC characterizes Respondent's misconduct "as being more omission 
than intentional acts." Based on this representation, the Board finds that Respondent acted 
negligently. However, the Board notes that although the record does not provide evidence of any 
actual serious injury to his clients, Respondent's failure to communicate with his clients and his 
failure to diligently pursue their legal matters may have unnecessarily delayed the legal matters of 
those clients. Furthermore, Respondent's failure to fully cooperate in the disciplinary 
investigation of the complaints filed against him has harmed the legal profession. An attorney's 
failure to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation unjustly delays and imposes an additional 
burden upon the disciplinary system.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In his petition, Respondent acknowledges that the aggravating factor of multiple 
offenses is present in this matter.<a class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a> Additionally, ODC states in its 
memorandum that the aggravating factor of failure to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation 
exists in this matter.<a class="fn" href="#fn7">7</a> Respondent further asserts that the mitigating 
factors of absence of a prior disciplinary record<a class="fn" href="#fn8">8</a> and remorse<a class="fn" href="#fn9">9</a> 
are also present. Based upon a review of the record, the Board finds that the aggravating and 
mitigating factors cited by Respondent and ODC are present in this matter. Additionally, although 
not cited by the parties, the record supports a finding that the mitigating factor of inexperience 
in the practice of law<a class="fn" href="#fn10">10</a> is also present. Respondent was admitted to 
practice law in Louisiana in October 1996. The misconduct given rise to the disciplinary complaints 
in this matter occurred less than three years after Respondent was admitted.
<a class="fn" href="#fn11">11</a></p>
<h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
<h3>I. ABA Standards</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer 
Sanction ("Standard") to determine the baseline sanction by determining "the type of duty violated, 
the lawyer's mental state and the extent of the injury caused; and then adjust[ing] the sanction in 
accordance with the aggravating and mitigating factors present." <span class="CITE"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 
94-1316 (La. 11/30/94); <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=646%20So.2d%20343$t=document-frameset.htm" >646 So. 2d 343</a>, 350.</span> </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The proposed sanction is in line with the ABA guidelines. Standard 
<span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span> provides 
for reprimand "when a lawyer is negligent and does not act with reasonable diligence in representing 
a client, and causes injury or potential injury to a client." Standard 
<span class="ABAstandard">7.3</span> provides for reprimand 
"when a lawyer negligently engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed to the profession, 
and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, or the legal system." Furthermore, 
the comments to Standard <span class="ABAstandard">2.5</span> state "reprimand is appropriate in cases where the lawyer's conduct, 
although violating ethical standards, is not serious enough to warrant suspension or disbarment." 
Therefore, under the ABA guidelines, reprimand is the appropriate sanction for Respondent's 
misconduct.</p>
<h3>II. Relevant Case Law</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The Board also looks to relevant case law for assistance in determining an 
appropriate sanction for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. ODC cites the following 
cases as instances where the Board has imposed a sanction similar to the one proposed by Respondent:
<span class="CITE"><i>In re Ossie Brown</i>, <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=00-DB-047.BD$t=document-frameset.htm" >00-DB-047</a> (Bd. 
Op. 7/31/00)</span>; <span class="CITE"><i>In re Willard James Brown</i>,
<a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=00-DB-016.BD$t=document-frameset.htm" >00-DB-016</a> (Bd. Op. 5/10/01)</span>; and <span class="CITE">
<i>In re Dolbear</i>, <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=98-DB-061.BD$t=document-frameset.htm" >98-DB-061</a> (Bd. Op. 2/24/99)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In the case of <i>In re Ossie Brown</i>, the attorney was issued a public 
reprimand for violations of Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3 and 1.4(a). There, the attorney 
received the file of a client from his former associate who had been handling the matter for several 
years. Although the client was notified in writing of the transfer of the file, the attorney did 
nothing substantive to move the matter forward or to keep the client informed as to the status of 
the case for over a year. Aggravating factors included substantial experience in the practice of 
law. The absence of a prior disciplinary record was cited as a mitigating factor. Bd. Op. at 2-3.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In the case of <i>In re Willard James Brown</i>, the attorney was issued a 
public reprimand for violations of Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3, 1.4(a), and 1.15(b).<a class="fn" href="#fn12">12</a> 
There, the complainant retained the attorney to represent him in a claim for damages against the 
Sheriff of St. Tammany Parish. The matter was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern 
District of Louisiana. The attorney did not file pre-trial inserts on behalf of his client prior to 
the pre-trial conference, as required, because the client failed to provide the names of his 
witnesses, and the attorney believed that all of his client's documentary evidence was already in 
the record. As a result, had this matter gone to trial, the client would have been limited in his 
ability to call witnesses and introduce evidence. Bd. Op. at 2.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The matter later was compromised before trial for the sum of $500.00. Prior to 
this settlement being accepted by the client, the attorney did not inform him that after the 
expenses and attorney's fee were withheld, he would only receive approximately $55.00 from the total 
settlement. In fact, it was some weeks later before the client was made aware of this fact. Shortly 
thereafter, the client filed his complaint with ODC. The attorney cooperated in the investigation of 
this complaint; however, sufficient evidence of misconduct was obtained to support the filing of 
formal charges. The client was paid his portion of the settlement during the course of the 
investigation of the complaint. Id. at 2-3.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Prior to the scheduled hearing, the attorney and ODC filed a joint petition for 
consent discipline. In the petition, the attorney admitted his misconduct and the parties proposed 
that as a result he receive a public reprimand. In accepting the petition, the Board noted the 
presence of the mitigating factors of absence of a prior disciplinary record and remorse. No 
aggravating factors were found to be present. Id. at 1, 3-4.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In the case of <i>In re Dolbear</i>, the attorney was issued a public reprimand 
for violations of Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.16(d), 8.1 and 8.4(a)(d)(g). There, 
the attorney was retained in a matter involving four imprisoned Mexican nationals and accepted money 
to obtain their release. He agreed to refund the money if he was unsuccessful. When he was 
unsuccessful, he failed to return the fee. In another matter, Dolbear agreed to review a file but 
failed to return it after the client decided not to retain him. He also failed to cooperate with ODC 
in its investigation of the complaints.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The Board found that Dolbear negligently failed to act with reasonable 
diligence, negligently handled client property, and failed to cooperate with ODC. Numerous 
aggravating factors were cited by the Board, including prior misconduct, failure to cooperate, 
vulnerability of the victims, and substantial experience in the practice of law. The mitigating 
factor of absence of selfish motive was also noted. Bd. Op. at 1-2.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The cases of <span class="CITE"><i>In re Laiche</i>,
<a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=98-DB-057.BD$t=document-frameset.htm" >98-DB-057</a> (Bd. Op. 7/15/99)</span> and <span class="CITE">
<i>In re Burks</i>, <a href="/NXT/gateway.dll?f=id$id=00-DB-125.BD$t=document-frameset.htm" >00-DB-125</a> (Bd. Op. 5/31/01)</span> also 
offer guidance here. In Laiche, formal charges were filed against the attorney consisting of alleged 
violations of Rules of Professional Conduct 1.4(a)(b), 1.16(d), 8.1(c), and 8.4(g). After Laiche 
admitted to violating Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 1.16(d), the parties later filed a joint motion for 
consent discipline proposing a public reprimand as the appropriate discipline. Bd. Op. at 1.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Count I of the formal charges brought against Laiche alleged that the respondent 
filed suit on behalf of his clients in a personal injury matter but did little more to move the case 
forward over the next eight years, in violation of Rule 1.3. Count II of the charges alleged that 
Laiche failed to keep his clients informed as to the progress or lack of progress of the case, in 
violation of Rule 1.4(a). The other pertinent counts alleged that the respondent failed to timely 
inform his clients of a settlement offer, failed to return a client's file, and failed to timely 
sign a motion to substitute counsel for clients who had discharged him. Id. at 1-2. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The only aggravating factor was Laiche's substantial experience in the practice 
of law. Mitigating factors included the absence of a disciplinary record, no dishonest or selfish 
motive and a timely good faith effort to rectify the misconduct. Id. at 2. The Board accepted the 
joint petition, ordering that the attorney receive a public reprimand and that he be assessed with 
all costs and expenses of the proceedings. In reaching its determination, the Board emphasized the 
fact that the clients did not suffer any actual harm. Id. at 3.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In Burks, the attorney and ODC filed a joint petition for consent discipline 
prior to the filing of formal charges. The record in that matter reveals that Burks was served with 
a complaint and failed to respond to the complaint in writing as required. A subpoena then was 
served upon him to obtain his sworn statement. He provided his statement and from thereon cooperated 
fully with the investigation of the matter. During the course of the investigation, Burks completed 
the succession that was the source of the complaint. Bd. Op. at 1.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In another matter, Loretta Evans, a widow of the attorney's client, Willie 
Evans, filed a complaint. Burks had accepted the representation of Mr. Evans in a medical 
malpractice case that had already been handled by two prior attorneys. Upon accepting 
representation, Burks had the medical records reviewed by an expert witness. The resulting report 
did not support the malpractice claim. At this same time, Burks experienced trouble in getting a 
medical review panel set up to review the claim. As a result, the case never went before the panel. 
Subsequently, the client died. Burks asserted that he kept Mr. Evans informed about her case, that 
Mr. Evans understood the problems and accepted the outcome. Mrs. Evans filed the complaint 
approximately four years after the last action on the case. Respondent cooperated in the 
investigation of this complaint. Id. at 2.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In the joint petition, the parties submitted that Burk's misconduct in the above 
two instances constituted violations of Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3, 1.4(a), 8.1(c), and 
8.4(g). In accepting the petition, the Board noted the presence of the mitigating factors of absence 
of a dishonest motive, remorse, and a good faith effort to rectify the consequences of his 
misconduct. Aggravating factors included prior disciplinary offenses and substantial experience in 
the practice of law. Bd. Op. at 3.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Although the Board recognizes that Respondent's conduct in this matter involved 
four clients, as opposed to the one or two clients involved in each of the above-cited cases, the 
Board notes that Respondent's misconduct involving these clients occurred within the same time 
frame. The Board is of the opinion that Respondent's misconduct in this matter is more indicative of 
his inexperience rather than any malicious intent on his part. Additionally, while the Board does 
not condone Respondent's failure to cooperate in the initial investigation, his agreement to enter 
into a consent discipline has lessened the delay caused by his initial failure and warrants 
consideration in the determination of the appropriate sanction in this matter. The Board also 
recognizes that the purpose of lawyer disciplinary proceedings in not primarily to punish the 
lawyer, but rather to maintain appropriate standards of professional conduct to safeguard the 
public, to preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from engaging 
in violations of the standards of the profession. <a class="fn" href="#fn13">13</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on the above, the Board is of the opinion that a public reprimand with 
special conditions that address the apparent source of Respondent's misconduct, his inexperience in 
the practice of law, appropriately serves to safeguard the public, to preserve the integrity of the 
legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the standards of the 
legal profession. Accordingly, the Board will accept the Petition. </p>
<h2>RULING</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the petition for consent discipline 
be accepted, and that a public reprimand be issued against the respondent, Edwin DeAundra Hawkins. 
Additionally, the Board orders that Respondent: </p>
<ol>
  <li>be assessed the costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence 
  running thirty days from the date of finality of this Ruling until paid;</li>
  <li>complete the following conditions within one year from the date of the issuance of this 
  reprimand:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
    <li>attend and complete the Ethics School presented by the Louisiana State Bar Association;</li>
    <li>earn an additional six hours of Continuing Legal Education credits in the area of law office 
    practice; and</li>
    <li>attend a program presented by the Loss Prevention Counsel for the Louisiana State Bar 
    Association.</li>
