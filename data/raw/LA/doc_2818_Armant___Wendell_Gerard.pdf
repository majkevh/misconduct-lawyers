  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: WENDELL G. ARMANT</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">RULING ON CONSENT DISCIPLINE</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based upon the filing of formal charges against Respondent,
  Wendell G. Armant, of New Orleans, Louisiana, for (count I) failing to act with diligence, failing to terminate
  representation properly, failing to communicate with clients, (count II) failing to provide a proper accounting of
  the fee paid and failing to cooperate in <b>a</b> disciplinary investigation.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On May 24, 1995, Disciplinary Counsel filed formal charges against Respondent.  Respondent,
  through counsel, filed a motion for consent discipline, requesting that a reprimand be imposed.  Disciplinary Counsel
  concurred.</p>

  <h2>FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On October 28, 1994, Mr. Lanny F. Ashford retained Respondent to file a personal bankruptcy. 
  Respondent accepted an advance fee and cost deposit.  Six months went by without any action by Respondent.  Although
  Respondent advised Mr. Ashford that the work was completed, Respondent failed to file the petition for bankruptcy. 
  Mr. Ashford retrieved his paperwork and consulted another attorney.  The delay caused considerable frustration and
  anxiety to Mr. Ashford and his wife, and they were placed in a worse financial position.</p>

  <h2><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/1996-12-09_95-DB-041.htm">RECOMMENDATION OF THE HEARING
  COMMITTEE</a></span></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The <a href="../HC/1996-12-09_95-DB-041.htm">Hearing Committee</a> concluded that the Respondent
  was not competent to handle the bankruptcy and should not undertaken to represent Mr. Ashford.  Respondent's motion
  for consent discipline indicates that he consulted with another attorney regarding the bankruptcy and ultimately
  filed a petition for bankruptcy on October 17, 1995.  Respondent violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.2</span>,
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4</span> and
  <span class="Rules">8.4</span><span class="Rules">(a)</span>. Aggravating factors: 1) <span class="ABAstandard">prior
  discipline</span> (one admonition) and 2) <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span> (accepting
  representation in areas in which he is not competent).  Mitigating circumstances include: 1)
  <span class="ABAstandard">absence of dishonest or selfish motive</span>; 2) <span class="ABAstandard">restitution of
  unearned fee and unused cost advance</span>; 3) <span class="ABAstandard">inexperience in the practice of law</span>
  and 4) <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>.  Considering ABA Standards <span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span> and
  <span class="ABAstandard">8.3(b)</span>, the Committee recommended a reprimand, the consent discipline proposed by
  Respondent.  Further, Respondent is to pay all costs associated with the proceedings and a copy of the reprimand is
  to be sent to Mr. Lanny Ashford.</p>

  <h2><b>RULING AND ORDER OF THE BOARD</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the motion for consent discipline, the Hearing Committee's recommendation and
  Disciplinary Counsel's concurrence, the Disciplinary Board agrees with proposed consent discipline of a reprimand. 
  The Disciplinary Board hereby orders that Respondent, Wendell G. Armant, be and hereby is publicly reprimanded for
  violating Rules <span class="Rules">1.2</span>, <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4</span> and
  <span class="Rules">8.4</span><span class="Rules">(a)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  Respondent is to
  pay all costs of these proceedings.</p>
