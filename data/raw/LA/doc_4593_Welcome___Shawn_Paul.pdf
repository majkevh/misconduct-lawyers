  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: SHAWN PAUL WELCOME</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This matter arises from two petitions for consent discipline filed jointly by respondent, Shawn
  Paul Welcome, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana but currently on interim suspension, and
  the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") prior to the institution of formal charges.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The underlying facts of these matters are not in dispute, having been stipulated to by the
  parties.</p>

  <h3>00-DB-112</h3>

  <h4>The Hammons Matter</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">In March 1999, Rebecca Hammons retained respondent to handle a workers' compensation matter.
  Respondent neglected the case and failed to communicate with his client. He also failed to return to Ms. Hammons the
  file relating to the matter.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In February 2000, Ms. Hammons filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. Respondent
  failed to reply to the complaint. The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on
  June 14, 2000 and answer the complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear.</p>

  <h4>The Koshen Matter</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">In July 1996, Richard Koshen retained respondent to file a civil suit against his former
  employer. Respondent negotiated a settlement with the defendant and accepted a check in the amount of $221 from him.
  However, Mr. Koshen had not approved the settlement of the case for that amount. Moreover, respondent did not give
  the $221 check to Mr. Koshen. He thereafter neglected the case and failed to communicate with his client.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In March 2000, Mr. Koshen filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. Respondent failed to
  reply to the complaint. The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him to appear on June 14,
  2000 and answer the complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear.</p>

  <h4>The Tulane Law School Matter</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">On December 29, 1999, respondent issued a $300 check to Tulane Law School in payment of the
  registration fee for a continuing legal education program sponsored by the law school. The check was subsequently
  returned NSF. Although the law school made several attempts to collect the seminar fee from respondent, he failed to
  make the check good.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In May 2000, Ms. Gilda Cross of Tulane Law School filed a complaint against respondent with the
  ODC. Respondent failed to reply to the complaint. The ODC thereafter served respondent with a subpoena compelling him
  to appear on June 14, 2000 and answer the complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear.</p>

  <h3>02-DB-003</h3>

  <h4>The Dupre Matter</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">In February 2000, Marshall Dupre retained respondent to handle a child support and child custody
  matter. Mr. Dupre paid respondent $3,505.66, of which $1,500 represented respondent's fee and $250 represented filing
  fees; the remaining sum, $1,755.66, was to be paid toward Mr. Dupre's child support obligation. Respondent neglected
  the case and failed to communicate with his client. He also failed to account for any earned portion of the legal fee
  and failed to refund the unearned portion of the fee. Furthermore, respondent did not promptly remit Mr. Dupre's
  child support payment.</p>

  <h4>The Gregoire Matter</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">In January 1999, Leo John Gregoire, Jr. retained respondent to handle his divorce. Although
  respondent filed the petition for divorce, he thereafter neglected the case and failed to communicate with his
  client. He also failed to account for any earned portion of the legal fee Mr. Gregoire paid and failed to refund the
  unearned portion of the fee.</p>

  <h4>The Davis Matter</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">In February 2000, David Scott Davis paid respondent $1,700 to handle a criminal matter.
  Respondent neglected the case and failed to communicate with his client. He also failed to refund the unearned
  portion of the fee Mr. Davis paid.</p>

  <h4>The Ely Matter</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">Lucille Ely retained respondent to write her will. After Mrs. Ely died, her heirs tried to
  contact respondent to obtain the papers he had prepared so that the will could be probated. However, respondent
  failed to communicate with the heirs and failed to forward to them the papers he possessed.</p>

  <h4>The Wilkerson Matter</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">In June 1999, Louis Wilkerson paid respondent $950 to handle a divorce and partition of community
  property. Although respondent initially completed some work on Mr. Wilkerson's behalf, he thereafter neglected the
  matter. He also failed to account for any earned portion of the legal fee and failed to refund the unearned portion
  of the fee.</p>

  <h4>The Thormas Matter</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">In November 2000, Ronnie Thormas retained respondent to handle three unrelated legal matters. Mr.
  Thormas paid respondent $2,500, along with $200 in filing fees. Although respondent completed one of the matters he
  had been retained to handle, he neglected the other two matters and failed to communicate with his client. He also
  failed to account for any earned portion of the legal fee and failed to refund the unearned portion of the fee.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Petitions for Consent Discipline</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC conducted an investigation into the complaints filed against respondent. On September 7,
  2000, prior to the institution of formal charges, respondent and the ODC filed a joint petition for consent
  discipline in 00-DB-112. In the petition, respondent admitted that his conduct in the Hammons, Koshen, and Tulane Law
  School matters constituted a violation of Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable
  diligence and promptness in representing a client), <span class="Rules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a
  client), <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span> (termination of the representation), <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span>
  (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation), <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules
  of Professional Conduct), <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit,
  or misrepresentation), and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation)
  of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The parties agreed that the mitigating factors present are absence of a prior
  disciplinary record, inexperience in the practice of law (admitted 1996), and remorse; the aggravating factors
  present include a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, and bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding
  by intentionally failing to comply with the orders of the disciplinary agency. For his misconduct, the parties
  proposed that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year and one day, followed by a two-year
  period of supervised probation with conditions. <a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">After the filing of the joint petition for consent discipline, the ODC received additional
  complaints against respondent. This prompted the parties to file a second petition for consent discipline,
  encompassing the new complaints. On December 28, 2001, respondent and the ODC filed a joint petition for consent
  discipline in 02-DB-003. In the petition, respondent admitted that his conduct in the Dupre, Gregoire, Davis, Ely,
  Wilkerson, and Thormas matters constituted a violation of Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span>,
  <span class="Rules">1.4</span>, <span class="Rules">1.5(f)</span> (payment of fees in advance of services),
  <span class="Rules">1.15</span> (safekeeping property of clients or third persons),
  <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The
  parties agreed that the mitigating factors present are absence of a prior disciplinary record, absence of a dishonest
  or selfish motive, personal and emotional problems,<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> timely good faith effort to
  rectify the consequences of the misconduct,<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> cooperative attitude toward the
  proceedings, inexperience in the practice of law, physical or mental disability or impairment, and remorse; the
  aggravating factors present include a pattern of misconduct and multiple offenses. For respondent's misconduct, the
  parties sought the imposition of an eighteen-month suspension, to run concurrently with the suspension proposed in
  00-DB-112.<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> The parties also agreed that respondent's suspension shall be followed by a
  two-year period of supervised probation subject to the same conditions as set forth in 00-DB-112.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On January 25, 2002, the two petitions for consent discipline were consolidated in the
  disciplinary board. Shortly thereafter, the ODC and respondent filed a joint motion for interim suspension, which
  this court granted on February 20, 2002. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Welcome</i>, 02-0289 (La. 2/20/02), 811 So. 2d
  874</span>.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2002-10-28_00-DB-112.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board reviewed the petitions for consent discipline separately. In connection
  with 00-DB-112, the board determined that respondent's misconduct was knowing and intentional and violated duties
  owed to his clients, the disciplinary system, and the profession. As to the Hammons and Koshen matters, the board
  found that respondent knowingly failed to perform services for a client, knowingly dealt improperly with client
  property, and engaged in a pattern of neglect, causing actual injury to Ms. Hammons and Mr. Koshen. As to the Tulane
  Law School matter, the board found respondent initially failed to honor the check he had written for the CLE seminar
  fee, despite several attempts at collection by the law school; this conduct harmed Tulane by depriving it of monies
  rightfully owed it for an extended period of time. The board concluded this conduct was both knowing and intentional,
  as was respondent's failure to respond to the complaints filed against him by his clients and the law school, and his
  failure to appear for a sworn statement pursuant to subpoena. Respondent's failure to cooperate with the ODC caused
  harm to the legal profession by unjustly delaying the resolution of the complaints.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based upon its review of the record, the board agreed with the parties' assessment of the
  aggravating and mitigating factors present. After considering the <i>ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer
  Sanctions</i> and the prior jurisprudence of this court dealing with misconduct similar to respondent's, the board
  concluded that a suspension is the baseline sanction in this case. Under the circumstances, the board agreed a one
  year and one day suspension from the practice of law, followed by a two-year period of probation with conditions, is
  appropriate for respondent's misconduct in 00-DB-112.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In connection with 02-DB-003, the board determined that respondent's misconduct was knowing and
  negligent and violated duties owed to his clients. Respondent neglected his clients' legal matters, failed to
  communicate with his clients, and failed to promptly return their property and unearned legal fees. Although the
  record does not provide specific information as to any injury suffered by the six clients at issue, at a minimum, it
  was established that these clients' legal matters were unduly delayed and that they were deprived of funds or other
  property to which they were entitled for an extended period of time.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">With respect to the aggravating and mitigating factors, the board agreed with the parties that a
  pattern of misconduct and multiple offenses should be considered in aggravation. However, the board found one of the
  mitigating factors cited by the parties, namely physical or mental disability or impairment, is not supported by the
  record. First, no evidence of a physical disability was presented by the parties. Furthermore, only limited evidence
  was presented to establish that respondent suffered from depression and substance abuse during the relevant time
  period. Notwithstanding this evidence, the parties presented nothing to establish a direct causation between the
  mental disability and chemical dependency and the misconduct at issue. Based on this reasoning, the board did not
  consider this factor in mitigation.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">After considering the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions and the prior jurisprudence
  of this court dealing with misconduct similar to respondent's, the board concluded that a suspension is the baseline
  sanction in this case. Under the circumstances, the board agreed an eighteen-month suspension from the practice of
  law, followed by a two-year period of probation with conditions, is appropriate for respondent's misconduct in
  02-DB-003.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In sum, the board found the proposed discipline in both matters appropriately addresses
  respondent's misconduct. Accordingly, the board recommended the joint petitions for consent discipline be accepted.
  The board further recommended that the discipline imposed in 00-DB-112 and 02-DB-003 run concurrently, retroactive to
  the date of respondent's interim suspension.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The rule violations in this case, as admitted by respondent, principally involve failure to
  account for and refund unearned fees, failure to communicate with clients, neglect of client matters, and failure to
  cooperate with the ODC. The sole issue presented for the court's consideration is whether the eighteen-month
  suspension proposed by respondent and the ODC is an appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In fashioning an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that the purpose of lawyer disciplinary
  proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to maintain appropriate standards of professional
  conduct to safeguard the public, to preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from
  engaging in violations of the standards of the profession. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v.
  Guidry</i>, <a href="1990-12-03_1988-0829.htm">571 So. 2d 161</a> (La. 1990)</span>. The discipline to be imposed
  depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any
  aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In prior cases involving similar misconduct, this court has imposed sanctions ranging from
  disbarment to fully deferred suspensions. After reviewing the record in its entirety, we find the scale is tilted in
  this case toward the lower end of the range. Of particular note is the fact that all of respondent's misconduct
  occurred within the same time frame - late 1999 and 2000 - during a period in which respondent suffered personal and
  emotional problems. Given the mitigating factors present in this case, in particular the absence of a prior
  disciplinary record and respondent's inexperience in the practice of law, absence of a dishonest or selfish motive,
  and timely good faith effort to rectify the consequences of his misconduct, coupled with the relatively minor
  aggravating factors present, we conclude an eighteen-month suspension is an appropriate sanction for respondent's
  misconduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on these factors, we find the proposed consent discipline is adequate under the
  circumstances. Accordingly, we will accept the joint petition for consent discipline and suspend respondent from the
  practice of law for eighteen months, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension. <a class="fn"
  href="#fn5">5</a></p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the
  record filed herein, it is ordered that Shawn Paul Welcome be suspended from the practice of law for eighteen months,
  retroactive to his February 20, 2002 interim suspension. All costs and expenses in these matters are assessed against
  respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the
  date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  </ol>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" id="fn2">2</a> Respondent had a substance abuse problem during the relevant

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3" id="fn3">3</a> After the complaints were filed, respondent made restitution to
  Mr. Dupre, Mr. Gregoire, Mr. Davis, and to Mrs. Ely's family; he returned Mrs. Ely's papers to her family; and he
  remitted the child support payment on Mr. Dupre's behalf. Furthermore, in connection with 00-DB-112, respondent has
  returned $221.64 to Mr. Koshen and paid $330 to Tulane Law School for the CLE seminar.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4" id="fn4">4</a> The parties proposed concurrent discipline because the
