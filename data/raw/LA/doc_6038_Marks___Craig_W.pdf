<font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p ALIGN="LEFT" class="Bodycopy">On October 12, 2004, respondent pleaded no 
contest to one felony count of indecent behavior with a juvenile, a violation of 
La. R.S. 14:81, arising out of his intimate relationship with a fourteen-year 
old girl. In 2005, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") filed formal 
charges against respondent arising out of his conviction. Respondent now seeks 
to permanently resign from the practice of law in lieu of discipline. The ODC 
has concurred in respondent's petition. Having considered the Petition for 
Voluntary Permanent Resignation from the Practice of Law filed by Craig W. 
Marks, Louisiana Bar Roll number 8923, and the concurrence thereto filed by the 
ODC,</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT" class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the request of Craig W. 
Marks for permanent resignation in lieu of discipline be and is hereby granted, 
pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, ยง 20.1 and Rule 5.5(c) of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct, as amended March 24, 2004.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT" class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Craig W. Marks shall 
be permanently prohibited from practicing law in Louisiana or in any other 
jurisdiction in which he is admitted to the practice of law; shall be 
permanently prohibited from seeking readmission to the practice of law in this 
state or in any other jurisdiction in which he is admitted; and shall be 
permanently prohibited from seeking admission to the practice of law in any 
jurisdiction.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT" class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the proceedings in 
07-B-0350 be dismissed as moot.</p>
