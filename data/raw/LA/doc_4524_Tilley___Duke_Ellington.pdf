<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>NO. 01-B-2454</p>

<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>IN RE: DUKE ELLINGTON TILLEY, JR.</p>

<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HEADINGSTYLE>ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p>PER CURIAM</p>
<p>This matter arises from two petitions for consent discipline, each filed 
jointly by
respondent, Duke Ellington Tilley, Jr., and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel 
(“ODC”)
prior to the institution of formal charges. For his misconduct in four unrelated 
matters,
the parties proposed that respondent be disbarred from the practice of law. The
disciplinary board recommended the proposed discipline be accepted.</p>
<p align="center"><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This proceeding involves four separate instances of misconduct. The facts are
not in dispute, having been stipulated to by the parties.</p>
<p align="center"><b>01-DB-015</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In January 1996, respondent was retained to handle a succession matter.<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> 
In a
partial judgment of possession signed in March 1998, the court ordered that 
$14,660
in cash belonging to a minor heir be placed in the registry of the court. 
However,
respondent failed to deposit these funds as he was ordered to do. Instead, 
respondent
claims that he kept the cash in his office and that it disappeared from the 
office.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent has failed to make restitution to the heir, despite repeated demands.&nbsp; Respondent also had exclusive control over the succession checking account.
He has written numerous checks from that account, each payable to “cash” and in 
an
even amount, usually $1,000 to $2,000. No explanation is included on most checks
to indicate the purpose of the payment, but the checks were apparently cashed by
respondent.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">During the course of the administration of the succession, a piece of immovable
property was sold pursuant to court order. Respondent listed the property with 
his
real estate company, with his wife as the listing agent, and collected a 
commission
when the property was sold. Respondent did not inform the heirs of this fact, 
and
failed to obtain a waiver of his conflict of interest from each of them.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent has made no annual accounting for the succession funds under his
control, and the succession bank account has a very low balance. In addition, 
after
four years, the succession remains open and has not been completed, and the 
heirs
have had little communication from respondent. Despite these facts, respondent 
has
collected a $10,000 attorney’s fee in the matter.</p>
<p align="center"><b>01-DB-038</b></p>
<p align="center"><i>The Lodge Matter</i></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Sherron Lodge retained respondent to represent her in an employment
discrimination claim pending in federal court. Respondent subsequently 
determined<br>
that the claim could not be maintained, and he did not oppose a motion for 
summary
judgment filed by the defendant. However, respondent apparently failed to inform 
Ms.
Lodge of this fact, or otherwise to keep her informed about the status of her 
case.
During the course of the ODC’s investigation of Ms. Lodge’s complaint, 
respondent was repeatedly asked to provide certain documents, which he did only after he 
was
served with a subpoena.</p>
<p align="center"><i>The Armstrong Matter</i></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Kweli Armstrong paid respondent $700 in December 1998 to handle a criminal
matter. Respondent neglected the matter and failed to communicate with his 
client.
Mr. Armstrong subsequently discharged respondent and requested a refund of the 
fee
he paid; however, respondent failed to comply with this request, nor did he 
provide
his client with an accounting of any work done in the matter.</p>
<p align="center"><i>The Employment Matter</i></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was employed by the Louisiana Attorney General’s Office from
March 30, 1999 to January 12, 2000. Such employment made it unlawful for<br>
respondent to represent criminal defendants, pursuant to La. Code Crim. P. art. 
65. <a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a>
Nevertheless, during this period of time, respondent represented numerous 
criminal
defendants in state district courts, both directly and indirectly. For example, 
in <i>State
v. Derrick Jerome Allen</i>, No. 11-98-303 on the docket of the 19th Judicial District
Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, respondent appeared in court on the 
record
in both April and June 1999. On the other hand, in <i>State v. Patrick Price</i>, No. 
99-0885
on the docket of the 19th Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton 
Rouge,&nbsp; other attorneys appeared on the record, but respondent was in the 
courtroom and
clearly involved in the representation.</p>
<p align="center"><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS </b></p>
<p align="center"><i>Petitions for Consent Discipline</i></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On February 1, 2001, respondent and the ODC filed a joint petition for consent
discipline in 01-DB-015. In the petition, respondent admitted that his conduct 
in the
succession matter constituted a violation of Rules <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- ID:RULE1.3 --">1.3</a></span> (failure to act with 
reasonable
diligence and promptness in representing a client), <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- ID:RULE1.4 --">1.4</a></span> (failure to communicate 
with a
client), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- ID:RULE1.5 --">1.5</a></span>(a) (fee arrangements), 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- ID:RULE1.8 --">1.8</a></span>(a) (prohibited transactions between a 
lawyer and
a client), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- ID:RULE1.15 --">1.15</a></span>(a) and (b) (safekeeping property of clients or third persons), 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- ID:RULE8.4 --">8.4</a></span>(c)
(engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 
and <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- ID:RULE8.4 --">8.4</a></span>(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) of the 
Rules of
Professional Conduct. Citing several aggravating factors, including prior 
disciplinary offenses, dishonest or selfish motive, pattern of misconduct, 
multiple offenses,<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> and&nbsp;
vulnerability of the victim, the parties proposed that respondent be disbarred 
from the
practice of law.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On April 10, 2001, respondent and the ODC filed a joint petition for consent
discipline in 01-DB-038. In the petition, respondent admitted that his conduct 
in the
Lodge, Armstrong, and employment matters constituted a violation of Rules 
<a href="#!-- ID:RULE1.3 --">1.3</a>, 
<a href="#!-- ID:RULE1.4 ---">1.4</a>, <a href="#!-- ID:RULE1.5 --">1.5</a>(f)(6) (payment of fees in advance of services), 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- ID:RULE1.7 --">1.7</a></span> (conflict of interest), 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- ID:RULE8.1 --">8.1</a></span>(c)
(failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation), <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- ID:RULE8.4 --">8.4</a></span>(c), and <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- ID:RULE8.4 --">8.4</a></span>(g) 
(failure to
cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct.
The parties added an additional aggravating factor to those cited in the earlier 
petition,
namely substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted 1992), and sought 
the imposition of disbarment, concurrent with the period of disbarment proposed 
in 01-DB-015. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On April 25, 2001, the two petitions for consent discipline were consolidated
in the disciplinary board.</p>
<p align="center"><i><a href="#!-- ID:00-DB-013.BD --">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></i></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board found that respondent knowingly, if not intentionally,
violated a duty owed to his clients, the legal system, and the profession. The 
board
found that in each instance, respondent’s misconduct caused serious actual 
injury to
his clients and the profession. The board concurred in the aggravating factors 
cited
by the parties in the joint petitions for consent discipline, and agreed that 
the record
does not support the presence of any mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Relying upon the ABA’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions and
jurisprudence from this court, the board concluded that the proposed sanction of
disbarment is appropriate to address respondent’s misconduct in the four matters 
at
issue. Accordingly, the board recommended the consent discipline be accepted and
that respondent be disbarred from the practice of law.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board's
recommendation.</p>
<p align="center"><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Although this matter arises from a petition for consent discipline, Supreme
Court Rule XIX, § 20(B) provides that the extent of discipline to be imposed is 
subject
to review. In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that 
disciplinary
proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the 
public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. 
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State
Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i></span>, <span class="CITE">
<a href="#!-- ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --">513 So. 2d 1173</a> </span>(La. 1987). The discipline to be imposed 
depends
upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, 
considered
in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n
v. Whittington</i></span>, <span class="CITE">
<a href="#!-- ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --">459 So. 2d 520</a></span> (La. 1984).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent has admitted to numerous instances of serious professional
misconduct, including neglect of legal matters, failure to communicate with 
clients,<br>
failure to account for or return unearned legal fees, failure to properly 
safeguard client
and third-party funds, engaging in prohibited conflicts of interest, and failure 
to
cooperate with the ODC in its investigation. Taken as a whole, and considering 
the
lengthy list of aggravating factors present in this case, disbarment is clearly
appropriate. Accordingly, we will accept the petition for consent discipline and 
order
that respondent be disbarred from the practice of law.</p>
<p align="center"><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and
considering the record filed herein, it is ordered that the name of Duke 
Ellington Tilley,
Jr. be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law 
in the State
of Louisiana be revoked. Respondent is ordered to make restitution to his 
clients and
to injured third parties. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed 
against
respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal 
interest to
commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s judgment until 
paid.</p>
