  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: JEFFRY LAMONTE SANFORD</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 01-DB-060</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a consent disciplinary proceeding with the Concurrence of the Office of Disciplinary
  Counsel ("ODC"), submitted after the filing of formal charges. For the reasons set forth below, the Board accepts the
  Petition for Consent Discipline and will order six months of unsupervised probation. This is subject to the
  conditions that the respondent seek and obtain counseling in anger management with written verification of same
  presented to the ODC to be completed during the six month period and that respondent pay all costs and expenses
  associated with these disciplinary proceedings.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On June 14, 2001, ODC filed Formal Charges, consisting of two counts, against respondent.
  Respondent filed a Response to the Formal Charges on July 23, 2001. The matter was set for hearing on October 2,
  2001. The hearing was continued without date and subsequently, the parties agreed to consent discipline. On October
  9, 2001, the parties filed a Stipulation of Facts; the Respondent filed a Petition for Consent Discipline, Waiver of
  Opportunity to Withdraw, and Affidavit; and a Concurrence was filed by the  Office of Disciplinary Counsel. The
  matter was submitted to the Board for review on December 13, 2001.</p>

  <h2>STIPULATED FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The following facts were stipulated:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Jeffry Lamonte Sanford is a Louisiana licensed attorney eligible to practice law and in good standing with the
    Louisiana State Bar Association.</p>

    <p>Jeffry Lamonte Sanford has been a Louisiana Licensed attorney since his admission to the Bar on October 11,
    1991.</p>

    <p>Jeffry Lamonte Sanford has no prior discipline of any kind, either private or public.</p>

    <p>On or about July 24, 1998, while attempting to take depositions in the matter of Danny Bailey vs. ICC, a dispute
    arose between counsel for the parties. As a result of that dispute, an additional issue arose as to whether or not
    defense counsel, Myron Walker, was entitled to be present in the inner office of Jeffry Lamonte Sanford. The
    parties acknowledged that an inappropriate contact took place between Jeffry Lamonte Sanford and Myron Walker. To
    the extent that any harm was caused to Mr. Walker by the conduct of Jeffry Lamonte Sanford, it has been
    appropriately and amicably resolved in separate proceedings. The Respondent acknowledges that his conduct
    represents an inadvertent violation of Rule 8.4(d)<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> (conduct prejudicial to the
    administration of justice).</p>

    <p>In connection with the succession of Harold McNemar, Kenny McNemar (the decedent's brother) was named executor
    and was represented by attorney Loren Kleinpeter. Jeffry Lamonte Sanford was independently consulted by the
    heirs/children of Harold McNemar in an effort to protect their rights and potentially asserts claims against their
    stepmother, Shirley McNemar. At a point in time when Jeffry Lamonte Sanford knew that Kenny McNemar was represented
    by counsel in his capacity as the executor of the estate of Harold McNemar, he nevertheless communicated directly
    with Kenny McNemar about the subject matter of the representation. Jeffry Lamonte Sanford acknowledged a negligent
    and inadvertent violation of Rule <span class="Rules">4.2</span><a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> of the Rules of
    Professional Conduct (communicating with a party known to be represented by counsel).</p>

    <p>The parties agree that the conduct in question in both instances was neither intentional nor knowing, but merely
    negligent and inadvertent.</p>

    <p>The violation of the rules cited herein, reflect violations of duties owed to the profession and to the system
    of justice. In the violation of Rule <span class="allegedrules">4.2</span>, no harm of any kind was caused to any
    party. In the violation of Rule <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span>, any harm caused to Myron Walker (which is at all
    times specifically and categorically denied) has been appropriately and satisfactorily addressed in a civil
    proceeding. No other harm was caused to any party or the litigant as a result of the Respondent's violation of Rule
    <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span>.</p>

    <p>The parties stipulate that there are no aggravating factors. The following mitigating factors are present:</p>

    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <p><span class="ABAstandard">Absence of a prior disciplinary record</span></p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><span class="ABAstandard">Absence of a dishonest or selfish motive</span></p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><span class="ABAstandard">Personal or emotional problems (anger management issues)</span></p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><span class="ABAstandard">Good faith effort to rectify consequences of misconduct</span></p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><span class="ABAstandard">Cooperative attitude towards the disciplinary proceeding</span></p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><span class="ABAstandard">Remorse</span></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent tenders a conditional admission to the charge of misconduct in exchange for a stated
  form of discipline, to wit, six months of unsupervised probation, subject to the following conditions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1. the respondent seek and obtain counseling in anger management with written verification of
    same presented to the ODC to be completed during the six month period; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">2. respondent pay all costs and expenses associated with these disciplinary proceedings.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>CONSIDERATION OF FACTORS FOR IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The respondent and ODC have agreed that respondent has violated Rules 8.4(d) (conduct prejudicial
  to the administration of justice) and 4.2 (communication with a party known to be represented by counsel) of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct. The Board must accept that the respondent has violated these rules.
  <span class="cite">In re Lieberman, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96); <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So.2d
  272</a></span>. Given the violation of these rules, the Board is left to determine if the proposed sanction is
  appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1. whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system,
    or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">2. whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">3. the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">4. the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's misconduct under Rules 4.2 and 8.4(d) constitute violations of duties owed to the
  legal system and to the profession. The Stipulation of Facts provides that the acts of the respondent were negligent
  or inadvertent and further, that the violation of Rule 4.2 (prohibited communication) caused no harm and that any
  harm caused by the violation of Rule 8.4(d) (misconduct) has been satisfactorily addressed in a civil proceeding.
  These stipulated facts are adopted by the Board.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board also recognizes the several mitigating factors to which the parties have stipulated,
  including the <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>, the
  <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">personal or
  emotional problems</span> (anger issues), <span class="ABAstandard">good faith effort to rectify consequences of
  misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">a cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceeding and
  remorse</span>. Although the parties stipulated that no aggravating factors exist, formal charges were brought on two
  counts, therefore, one aggravating factor exists: <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle"><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions to
  determine the baseline sanction. The Standards require consideration of "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's
  mental state and the extent of the injury caused". The Standards then require an adjustment to the sanction in
  accordance with the aggravating and mitigating factors present." <span class="cite">In re Quaid, 94-1316, p. 13 (La.
  11/30/94); <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So.2d 343</a>, 350</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ABA Standards suggest the following as a baseline sanction for a violation of a duty to the
  legal system, such as was committed by the respondent when he improperly communicated with a represented person:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="ABAstandard">6.32</span> Admonition is generally appropriate when a lawyer engages in an isolated
    instance of negligence in improperly communicating with an individual in the legal system, and causes little or no
    actual or potential injury to a party, or causes little or no actual or potential interference with the outcome of
    the legal proceeding.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">With respect to a violation of a duty owed to the profession, the ABA Standards suggest the
  following baseline sanction:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="ABAstandard">7.3</span> Reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer negligently engages in
    conduct that is a violation of a duty owed to the profession and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the
    public, or the legal system.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the above, the appropriate sanction would be reprimand or admonition, however, taking
  into account the several mitigating factors, a deviation from these baseline sanctions is warranted. ABA Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">2.7</span> suggests that probation is appropriate. The commentary following that standard
  provides:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>[P]robation is a sanction that should be imposed when a lawyer's right to practice law needs to be monitored or
    limited rather than suspended or revoked . . . . Probation is appropriate for conduct which may be corrected, e.g.
    improper maintenance of books and records; lack of timely communication with clients; failure to file income tax
    returns; or alcohol and chemical dependency . . . .</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As with the cited violations, the respondent's conduct may be corrected by the imposition of the
  conditions imposed (e.g.: anger management counseling) during the proposed probationary period.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The purpose of lawyer disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather
  to maintain appropriate standards of professional conduct to safeguard the public, to preserve the integrity of the
  legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the standards of the profession.
  <span class="cite">In re Mayeaux, 99-3549(La. 5/16/00); <a href="../SC/2000-05-16_1999-3549.htm">762 So.2d
  1072</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The parties agree and the Board concurs, that the proposed discipline will appropriately
  accomplish these goals, particularly protecting the public, and will assist the respondent to meet his ethical
  obligations.</p>

  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the foregoing, the Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board accepts the Petition and
  orders Jeffry Lamonte Sanford be placed on probation, unsupervised, for a period of six months, subject to the
  condition that he seek and obtain counseling in anger management with written verification of same presented to the
  Office of Disciplinary Counsel, to be completed during the six month period, and that he pay all costs and expenses
  associated with these disciplinary proceedings.</p>
