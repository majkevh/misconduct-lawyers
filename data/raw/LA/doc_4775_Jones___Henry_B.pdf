  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 04-B-0437</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: HENRY B. JONES, JR.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, Henry B. Jones, Jr., an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana but currently on
  interim suspension.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <h3>Counts I and II - The Steadman/Pineda Matter</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In August 1996, respondent settled personal injury claims on behalf of Ms. Sharon Steadman and
  Ms. Josephine Steadman.  Respondent had previously received written notice of a statutory lien for medical services
  provided to his clients by Jose Pineda, M.D., and by letter dated June 4, 1996, respondent agreed to protect Dr.
  Pineda's interest in the settlement of the personal injury claims.  Nevertheless, respondent failed to pay the sums
  owed to Dr. Pineda, totaling $970 for Sharon Steadman and $870 for Josephine Steadman.  Respondent subsequently
  acknowledged that he paid these sums directly to his clients based upon their representation that they had made
  arrangements to satisfy Dr. Pineda's charges.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">After Dr. Pineda filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC, respondent was served with a
  subpoena compelling him to appear on April 1, 1997 with his entire file in the Steadman matter.  Respondent failed to
  appear on that date, but he did subsequently appear on February 3, 1998 to give sworn testimony concerning the
  matter.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC alleged respondent's failure to pay a third-party medical provider violated Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.15(b)</span> (safekeeping property of clients or third persons) and
  <span class="allegedrules">4.1(a)</span> (knowingly making a false statement of material fact to a third person) of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct.  The ODC alleged respondent's failure to appear pursuant to a subpoena violated
  Rules <span class="allegedrules">3.4(a)</span> (unlawfully obstructing another party's access to evidence),
  <span class="allegedrules">3.4(c)</span> (knowing disobedience of an obligation under the rules of a tribunal),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.1(b)</span> (knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand for information from a
  disciplinary authority), <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation), as well as Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, § 9(c) (knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary
  authority).</p>

  <h3>Count III - The Moore Matter</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In March 1997, Alberta Moore paid respondent $750 to handle an adoption proceeding on her
  behalf.  Respondent neglected the matter, failed to communicate with his client, and failed to refund the unearned
  portion of the legal fee he was paid.<a name="_ftnref1" class="fn" href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">1</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC alleged respondent's conduct violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.1</span>
  (failure to provide competent representation to a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> (failure to act with
  reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> (failure to
  communicate with a client), and <span class="allegedrules">1.5</span> (fee arrangements) of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count IV - The Revilla Matter</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In May 1997, Dolores C. Revilla paid respondent $500 to represent her in a criminal case.  On
  June 10, 1997, respondent appeared in court and entered a not guilty plea on Ms. Revilla's behalf, but thereafter he
  neglected the matter and failed to communicate with his client.  As a result, the trial court was required to appoint
  an indigent defender to represent Ms. Revilla.  Respondent also failed to refund the unearned portion of the legal
  fee he was paid. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC alleged respondent's conduct violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count V - Misdemeanor Theft Conviction</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In 1995, respondent received a $1,518 check payable to LaTonya Taylor in connection with the
  asset forfeiture proceeding subject of Count VI of the formal charges.  Respondent endorsed the check without Ms.
  Taylor's consent and retained the proceeds for his own use.  On November 29, 2000, respondent pleaded guilty to
  misdemeanor theft and was sentenced under La. Code Crim. P. art. 894 to pay court costs and to serve one month in the
  parish jail.  The court ordered the jail sentence suspended and placed respondent on unsupervised probation for a
  period of three months.  <i>State v. Jones</i>, No. 191,679 on the docket of the 1st Judicial District Court for the
  Parish of Caddo.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC alleged respondent's conviction constituted a violation of Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">4.1</span> (truthfulness in statements to others),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(b)</span> (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on the lawyer's honesty,
  trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3>Count VI - The Taylor Matter</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In connection with his representation of Broderick Taylor in a criminal case pending in Caddo
  Parish, respondent sought the return of funds that were seized from Mr. Taylor at the time of his arrest and made
  subject of an asset forfeiture proceeding.  In September 1993, respondent prepared an affidavit that was executed by
  Mr. Taylor's sister, LaTonya Taylor, in which she attested that the funds seized from Mr. Taylor actually belonged to
  her.  Based upon the representations made in the affidavit, the seized funds were returned to LaTonya Taylor by the
  Caddo Parish District Attorney's Office.  However, in a subsequent proceeding, respondent submitted a contradictory
  affidavit in which he asserted that the seized funds did not belong to LaTonya Taylor, but rather belonged to
  Broderick Taylor.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct violated Rule 3.3 (candor toward the tribunal) of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h4>[Count VII] Contempt of Court</h4>

  <p class="bodycopy">In September 1997, respondent was charged with direct contempt of court for refusing to produce
  documents subpoenaed from him by the Caddo Parish District Attorney's Office.  Following an October 20, 1997 hearing
  in the 1st Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, respondent was held in contempt of court and sentenced to
  pay a fine of $200 and costs, or in default thereof, to serve five days in the parish jail.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent's conduct violated Rules 3.3, 8.4(a), 8.4(b), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d)
  of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On March 18, 1998, prior to the filing of formal charges against respondent, this court granted a
  joint petition for interim suspension submitted by respondent and the ODC.  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Jones</i>,
  98-0414 (La. 3/18/98), 707 So. 2d 1247</span>.  Thereafter, the court rejected a petition for consent discipline
  filed by respondent and ordered that formal charges be instituted.  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Jones</i>, 98-1475
  (La. 7/2/98), 712 So. 2d 500</span>. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On July 5, 2001, the ODC filed six counts of formal charges against the respondent.  Respondent
  did not file an answer to the formal charges, and the factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and
  proven by clear and convincing evidence.  After consideration of written argument and documentary evidence submitted
  by the ODC on the issue of sanctions, the hearing committee recommended that respondent be disbarred.  The
  disciplinary board subsequently determined that respondent had made a good faith effort to respond to the formal
  charges, but that he had not been afforded proper notice of the proceedings in order to participate should he choose
  to do so.  Accordingly, on May 13, 2002, the disciplinary board vacated the order deeming the formal charges
  admitted, and remanded the matter for a formal hearing before a hearing committee. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Following remand, the ODC amended the formal charges against respondent to add the seventh count
  discussed above, relating to the contempt of court.<a name="_ftnref2" class="fn" href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">2</a> 
  Respondent did not file an answer to the amended formal charges.  The matter then proceeded to a hearing on the
  merits, which was conducted by the hearing committee on July 29, 2002.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2003-05-05_01-DB-068.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">At the hearing, the ODC presented documentary evidence in support of the formal charges and
  respondent testified on his own behalf. After reviewing the evidence, the hearing committee made the following
  factual findings and legal conclusions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="u">Count I</span>:  Respondent agreed in writing on June 4, 1996 to protect the interest of Dr.
    Jose Pineda and to withhold the amount of Dr. Pineda's charges for medical services rendered to Sharon and
    Josephine Steadman from any sums received in settlement of Sharon and Josephine Steadman's personal injury
    matters.  The claims of Sharon and Josephine Steadman were settled, which settlements yielded sums sufficient to
    pay Dr. Pineda's medical charges.  Respondent disbursed the proceeds of the settlements, but failed to account to
    Dr. Pineda for the charges with respect to Josephine Steadman totaling $870, and Sharon Steadman totaling $970 from
    the funds received in settlement.  Rather, the funds representing Dr. Pineda's charges were paid to the Steadmans. 
    The committee determined respondent's conduct violated Rules 1.15 and 4.1.</p>

    <p><span class="u">Count II</span>:  Respondent was served with a subpoena on March 31, 1997 ordering him to appear
    before Disciplinary Counsel on April 1, 1997 to testify and produce his file in connection with the investigation
    of the complaint filed by Dr. Pineda.  Respondent failed, refused and/or neglected to respond to the subpoena on
    the date appointed but later met with the Disciplinary Counsel and voluntarily surrendered his license to practice
    law pending the outcome of this proceeding.  The committee determined respondent did not violate the Rules of
    Professional Conduct in connection with this count; the committee made no reference to the violation of Supreme
    Court Rule XIX, § 9(c) alleged in the formal charges.</p>

    <p><span class="u">Count III</span>:  In 1997, respondent was retained by Alberta Moore to file and complete an
    adoption proceeding whereby Ms. Moore was to adopt Rebecca Wiggins.  Respondent was paid the sum of $750 for the
    filing and completion of the adoption proceeding.  Respondent failed to take any steps in connection with the
    adoption and further failed to communicate or keep his client advised of the status of the matter.  Respondent
    failed to return or account for any unearned fees paid to him by Alberta Moore.  The adoption was later completed
    by respondent's law partner at no additional charge to the client.  The committee determined respondent's conduct
    violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5.</p>

    <p><span class="u">Count IV</span>:  In May 1997, respondent was retained by Dolores C. Revilla to represent her in
    Caddo Parish District Court on a felony theft charge.  Respondent was paid $500 for the representation.  Respondent
    appeared on one occasion for Ms. Revilla in order to obtain a continuance, and met with the prosecutor and judge to
    negotiate a plea agreement, but failed to appear for any subsequent court settings on behalf of Ms. Revilla.  It
    was necessary for the court to appoint another attorney to represent Ms. Revilla due to the failure of respondent
    to appear on her behalf and/or to communicate with her concerning her case.  The appointed attorney concluded the
    plea agreement previously negotiated by respondent.  The committee determined respondent's conduct violated Rules
    1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5.</p>

    <p><span class="u">Count V</span>:  Respondent forged the endorsement of LaTonya Taylor to a check and converted
    the funds, approximately $1,500, to his own use.  Respondent was subsequently convicted of misdemeanor theft on
    November 29, 2000.  The committee determined respondent's conduct violated Rules 3.3,<a name="_ftnref3" class="fn"
    href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">3</a> 8.4(b), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d).</p>

    <p><span class="u">Count VI</span>:  In connection with his representation of Broderick Taylor on criminal drug
    possession charges, respondent sought the return of funds subject of an asset forfeiture proceeding in Caddo Parish
    District Court.  Respondent procured and obtained from LaTonya Taylor, the sister of Broderick Taylor, an affidavit
    asserting her ownership of the funds at issue.  Based upon the affidavit of LaTonya Taylor, respondent obtained
    return of the funds for his client by asserting before the tribunal that the funds actually belonged to LaTonya
    Taylor.  Subsequently, in documents filed on respondent's own behalf in a criminal contempt matter pending against
    him, respondent asserted that the funds in question actually belonged to Broderick Taylor.  The committee did not
    make a finding of rule violations in connection with Count VI.  The committee's report also did not address the
    contempt issue raised in Count VII of the amended formal charges.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">The committee determined that respondent neglected matters entrusted to him, failed to
  communicate with his clients, failed to safeguard and account for funds held for a third-party medical provider, made
  untrue representations to a tribunal in an asset forfeiture proceeding, and converted client funds and/or funds of a
  third party to his own use.  The committee found respondent's conduct was intentional.  Respondent willfully
  converted client and third-party funds and since the date of his interim suspension has never repaid any of the
  complainants any portions of the sums due.  He was convicted of stealing money belonging to a former client, LaTonya
  Taylor, by endorsing her name to a check made payable to her and cashing the check and retaining the funds.  In
  addition, he knowingly confected a false affidavit which he presented to the court in order to procure funds which
  did not belong to him.  Respondent has caused serious harm to his former clients and the medical provider in question
  by converting their funds to his own use.  He has also brought the legal profession into disrepute by his conviction
  of a crime involving forgery, theft, and misappropriation of funds.  Considering the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing
  Lawyer Sanctions</i>, the committee determined the baseline sanction in this matter is disbarment.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the committee recognized respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest
  or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">a pattern of misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">and
  multiple offenses</span>.  In mitigation, the committee found no evidence was submitted showing that respondent has a
  prior disciplinary record.<a name="_ftnref4" class="fn" href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">4</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Considering the seriousness of the misconduct, in particular the pattern of neglect of
  respondent's duties as a lawyer which caused harm to his clients, his filing of false documents, and his conviction
  of a crime involving theft and forgery and misappropriation of client funds, the committee recommended that
  respondent be disbarred.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-02-18_01-DB-068.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">After reviewing this matter, the disciplinary board made the following factual findings and legal
  conclusions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="u">Count I</span>:  The ODC presented numerous letters to respondent from Dr. Pineda requesting
    payment for the treatment of two patients, Josephine Steadman ($870) and Sharon Steadman ($970).  Dr. Pineda also
    received a letter from respondent dated June 4, 1996, wherein respondent assured Dr. Pineda that he would be paid
    out of any proceeds from the settlement of the personal injury claims.  The claims were settled but respondent
    failed to pay Dr. Pineda; rather, respondent released the funds intended for Dr. Pineda to the Steadmans.  The
    board determined that respondent failed to protect funds belonging to a third party, in violation of Rule
    <span class="Rules">1.15(b)</span>, and made a false statement of fact to Dr. Pineda, in violation of Rule
    <span class="Rules">4.1(a)</span>.</p>

    <p><span class="u">Count II</span>:  The ODC introduced the subpoena personally served on respondent on March 31,
    1997, requiring him to appear for a sworn statement on April 1, 1997 concerning his representation of the
    Steadmans.  The ODC filed a copy of a <i>proces verbal</i> evidencing respondent's failure to appear.  The board
    determined that respondent failed to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation and failed to appear pursuant to a
    subpoena, in violation of Rules <span class="Rules">3.4(c)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.1(b)</span>,
    <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span>, and
    <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span>, as well as Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 9(c).  However, the board found no evidence
    suggesting that respondent obstructed the ODC's access to evidence in the Pineda matter, in violation of Rule
    3.4(a).</p>

    <p><span class="u">Count III</span>:  The ODC introduced Ms. Moore's complaint, her affidavit attesting that she
    engaged respondent to handle an adoption, and a receipt signed by respondent evidencing payment of $750.  Ms. Moore
    attempted to contact respondent by phone and in person at his office, but he was never available.  The board
    determined respondent failed to provide competent representation to Ms. Moore, failed to communicate with her,
    neglected her adoption matter, and failed to provide an accounting and a refund of unearned fees, in violation of
    Rules <span class="Rules">1.1</span>, <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4</span>, and
    <span class="Rules">1.5</span>.</p>

    <p><span class="u">Count IV</span>:  The ODC introduced Ms. Revilla's complaint, her affidavit attesting that she
    hired respondent for a criminal representation, but that he failed to appear in court and could not be contacted,
    and a receipt signed by respondent evidencing payment of $500.  The board determined respondent failed to provide
    competent representation to Ms. Revilla, failed to communicate with her, neglected her criminal case, and failed to
    provide an accounting and a refund of unearned fees, in violation of Rules <span class="Rules">1.1</span>,
    <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4</span>, and <span class="Rules">1.5</span>.</p>

    <p><span class="u">Count V</span>:  The ODC introduced the court minutes evidencing respondent's conviction of
    misdemeanor theft stemming from his fraudulent endorsement of a $1,518 check payable to LaTonya Taylor.  The board
    determined respondent made a false statement of material fact to third persons when he endorsed Ms. Taylor's name
    to the check without her authority and negotiated the check at the bank, in violation of Rule 4.1.  Moreover,
    respondent's theft of his client's funds violated Rules <span class="Rules">8.4(b)</span>,
    <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span>.  Respondent has since fully repaid the
    Taylors. </p>

    <p><span class="u">Count VI</span>:  The sum of $1,518 was seized from Broderick Taylor during a drug stop. 
    Broderick's only hope to retrieve the money was to have his sister, LaTonya Taylor, claim that the money belonged
    to her.  At respondent's request, LaTonya made out a false affidavit in order to have the money returned.  The
    board determined that respondent intentionally filed a false affidavit with the court in the forfeiture proceeding,
    in violation of Rule <span class="Rules">3.3</span>. </p>

    <p><span class="u">Count VII</span>:  Respondent was found in contempt of court for failing to turn over certain
    documents in connection with the Taylor matter, after having been ordered by the court to do so.  The board
    determined that respondent's conduct violated Rules <span class="Rules">3.3</span>,
    <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(b)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span>, and
    <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span>.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent knowingly violated duties owed to his clients, the public, the legal system, and as a
  professional by failing to provide competent representation, failing to communicate with clients, failing to use
  reasonable diligence, knowingly filing a false affidavit with a court, failing to properly safeguard the funds of
  clients and third parties, failing to provide an accounting and return unearned fees, failing to cooperate with a
  disciplinary investigation, engaging in criminal conduct (misdemeanor theft conviction), conduct prejudicial to the
  administration of justice (found in contempt for failing to turn over documents to the court), and conduct that
  reflects adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness, and fitness to practice law.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent caused actual harm to his client, Mr. Taylor ($1,518), and a third party, Dr. Pineda
  ($1,840), by depriving them of their money.  Due to his own arrest, respondent was not able to appear in court with
  Dolores Revilla, did not complete her representation, and did not refund her money ($500).  Mr. Taylor and his
  sister, LaTonya Taylor, received a full refund on May 12, 2000, but Dr. Pineda and Ms. Revilla have not been
  reimbursed.  Based upon respondent's testimony and a lack of contradictory evidence from the ODC, Alberta Moore's
  adoption matter appears to have been resolved by respondent's former law partner at no additional cost.  Considering
  the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, the board determined the baseline sanction for respondent's
  misconduct is a suspension from the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As aggravating circumstances, the board recognized respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">prior
  disciplinary offenses</span>,<a name="_ftnref5" class="fn" href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">5</a>
  <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">a pattern of
  misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith
  obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice
  of law</span> (admitted 1978), and <span class="ABAstandard">indifference to making restitution</span>.  The board
  found the record supports the mitigating factors of imposition of other penalties or sanctions (with respect to the
  contempt and his misdemeanor theft conviction), <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>, and
  <span class="ABAstandard">remoteness of prior disciplinary offenses</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Under the facts presented, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice
  of law for three years, retroactive to his March 18, 1998 interim suspension.  The board also recommended that
  respondent be ordered to provide accountings and make restitution to Dr. Pineda and Ms. Revilla, and that he be
  assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from
  the date of finality of the court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">One board member dissented, stating that in his view, "the continuous and repeated violations
  justify disbarment."</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC filed an objection in this court to the sanction recommended by the disciplinary board. 
  Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(G)(1)(b), a timely filed objection to the board's findings and
  recommendations ordinarily results in the assignment of the matter for oral argument.  However, in this case, both
  parties agreed to waive oral argument and consented to our consideration of the matter on the record presented.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court.  La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence.  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Quaid</i>,
  94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana
  State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall</i>, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>.  While we
  are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have
  held the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings.  <i>See</i>
  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Caulfield</i>, 96-1401 (La.  11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d
  714</a></span>; <span class="cite"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94),
  <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The record supports the detailed factual findings of the hearing committee and disciplinary
  board.  Respondent was held in contempt of court for failing to comply with a subpoena, and he submitted a false
  affidavit to a court in a legal proceeding.  Furthermore, respondent has engaged in serious criminal conduct which
  resulted in his conviction of theft for fraudulently endorsing a check payable to his client and converting the funds
  to his own use.  No less serious is respondent's neglect of the legal matters of two clients, failure to communicate
  with his clients, failure to account for or refund unearned fees owed to his clients, and failure to protect the
  interests of a third-party medical provider.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Having found evidence of professional misconduct, we now turn to a determination of the
  appropriate sanction for respondent's actions.  In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary
  proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the
  profession, and deter future misconduct.  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>,
  <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.  The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances.  <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent's actions are clearly serious in nature and caused actual harm.  Contrary to the
  position taken by the majority of the disciplinary board, we find the baseline sanction for respondent's intentional
  misconduct is disbarment.  Moreover, we find no justification in the record for deviating downward from the baseline
  in this case.  Rather, we agree with the hearing committee and the dissenting member of the disciplinary board that
  respondent's misconduct is egregious and demonstrates a lack of concern for the welfare of his clients, third
  persons, and the administration of justice.  The aggravating factors present in this case - in particular
  respondent's selfish motive and his utter indifference to making restitution to Dr. Pineda, Ms. Moore, and Ms.
  Revilla - further support our view in this regard.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Accordingly, we will reject the disciplinary board's recommendation of a three-year suspension
  and impose disbarment, retroactive to March 18, 1998, the date of respondent's interim suspension.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Henry B. Jones, Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 7485, be and he hereby
  is disbarred.  His name shall be stricken from the roll of attorneys and his license to practice law in the State of
  Louisiana shall be revoked.  It is further ordered that respondent shall pay restitution to Jose Pineda, M.D. in the
  amount of $1,840.00, to Alberta Moore in the amount of $750.00, and to Dolores C. Revilla in the amount of $500.00,
  all with legal interest.  All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with
  Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's
  judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn1" class="fn" href="#_ftnref1" id="_ftn1">1</a>  The adoption proceeding had not
  been completed as of August 1997, when Ms. Moore filed her complaint with the ODC.  However, it appears from the
  record that the adoption was subsequently completed by respondent's former wife and law partner, Brenda Ford-Jones,
  at no additional cost to Ms. Moore.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn2" class="fn" href="#_ftnref2" id="_ftn2">2</a>  The contempt count is not

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn3" class="fn" href="#_ftnref3" id="_ftn3">3</a>  The formal charges do not
  allege that respondent's conduct in connection with Count V constituted a violation of Rule 3.3 (candor toward the
  tribunal).  Rather, the formal charges allege that respondent made a false statement of material fact to a third
  person, in violation of Rule 4.1.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="_ftn4" class="fn" href="#_ftnref4" id="_ftn4">4</a>  The committee also acknowledged
  that respondent expressed "true <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>" for failing to pay Dr. Pineda's medical
  expenses, which may be considered a mitigating factor.  However, as to "the primary and most serious charges of
  misappropriation or theft and filing of false affidavits," the committee noted that respondent "offered an
  explanation but did not acknowledge the wrongness of his conduct or regret that he had handled the matter in the way
  he did."  A lawyer's <span class="ABAstandard">refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct</span> is
  properly considered as an aggravating factor.</p>
