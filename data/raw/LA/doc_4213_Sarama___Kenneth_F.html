NO. 97-B-0452<br>
IN RE: KENNETH F. SARAMA<br>
<br>
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>PER CURIAM'<br>
</p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font color="#000000">This disciplinary proceeding arises from two counts of formal charges filed by disciplinary counsel against respondent, Kenneth F. Sarama.&nbsp; The first count involved the conversion of client funds, and the second count pertained to respondent's failure to comply with a subpoena issued by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font color="#000000">In March 1994, respondent settled a personal injury claim against the Sunshine Rehabilitation Center on behalf of his client, Herbert Callahan, for approximately $11,000.&nbsp; On March 28, 1994, respondent disbursed $4,903 to</font><font color="#000000"> </font><font color="#000000">Callahan, kept $3,600 as his fee and withheld $2,000 for settlement of the claim of an intervenor in the case, placing the funds in his client trust account.&nbsp; Respondent had permission from Callahan to hold the money and to attempt to reach a settlement with the intervenor.&nbsp; Although respondent made some efforts at settlement, he was unable to reach an agreement with the intervenor.&nbsp; In April, 1995, approximately one year after respondent retained the funds, Callahan demanded payment of the remaining $2,000.&nbsp; Respondent refunded the $2,000 on April 26, 1995. However, bank records from the period during which respondent retained the funds indicated that respondent allowed the balance in&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;his client trust account to fall below $2,000.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font color="#000000">After receiving a complaint, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel served respondent with a subpoena ordering production of the cancelled checks disbursing the settlement funds to Callahan.&nbsp; Respondent failed to comply with the request.</font></span></p>
