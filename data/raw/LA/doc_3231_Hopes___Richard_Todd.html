  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: RICHARD TODD HOPES</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 01-DB-093</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE LOUISIANA DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based upon formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary
  Counsel (herein "ODC") and a subsequent Petition for Consent Discipline (herein "Petition") filed by Richard Todd
  Hopes (herein "Respondent") of Kingwood, Texas. This matter came before the Board on one count involving the failure
  to return client's file upon termination and failure to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation. After having
  reviewed the record, the Board finds the applicable sanction for violating Rule 1.16(d), 8.1(c) and 8.4(g) is a
  public reprimand.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On September 10, 2001, ODC filed formal charges against Respondent. Respondent failed to respond
  to the formal charges after service by certified mail at two addresses. On October 29, 2001, ODC and Respondent filed
  a Joint Petition for Consent Discipline (herein "Petition") and Stipulated Facts. Panel "B" heard this matter on
  November 29, 2001.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES <a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></h2>

  <blockquote>
    <div id="fc01-DB-093">
      <p>The Office of Disciplinary Counsel received a complaint from Charles E. Hoffpauir, which was opened as
      investigative matter No. 0010881. The complaint alleged that the Respondent had withdrawn from his representation
      of the Complainant in a criminal matter and Respondent had failed to turn over the file or communicate with the
      new attorney, despite repeated requests. Respondent received notice of the complaint, via certified mail, and was
      given 15 calendar days to respond in writing. He failed to respond. Mr. Hopes was again notified of the complaint
      and his obligation to cooperate; however, he has not cooperated in any manner. The actions of Respondent
      constitute failure to return client's file upon termination of representation, in violation of Rule
      <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span>; and, failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation, in
      violation of Rules <span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)</span> of the
      Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
    </div>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>STIPULATED FACTS <a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a></h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Respondent represented Charles E. Hoffpauir in a criminal matter. However, after withdrawing as counsel,
    Respondent failed to return the client file or communicate with the new attorney, despite repeated requests.</p>

    <p>Respondent received notice of the compliant [sic], via certified mail, and was given 15 calendar days to respond
    in writing. He failed to respond. Mr. Hopes was again notified of the complaint and his obligation to cooperate;
    however, he has not cooperated in any manner.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent agrees that his conduct violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span> ,
  <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct in
  exchange for a public reprimand.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED SANCTION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rule 1.16(d),<a class="fn"
  href="#fn3">3</a> 8.1(c)<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> and 8.4(g)<a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct. The Board must accept that Respondent has violated these rules. <span class="CITE"><i>In re
  Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. June 7, 1996); <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given
  the violations of these Rules, the Board is left to determine if the proposed sanction of a public reprimand is
  appropriate</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board is required to analyze the facts of the consent discipline to determine if the proposed
  sanction is appropriate for the stated misconduct. La. Sp. Ct. R. XIX, §20.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board must either accept or reject the proposed consent discipline. In making its findings,
  the Louisiana Supreme Court requires the Board to consider whether the proposed discipline is appropriate for the
  alleged misconduct by applying the following criteria:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the
      profession;</li>

      <li>whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</li>

      <li>the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</li>

      <li>the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.<br />
       La. Sp. Ct. R. XIX, §10(C).</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent has violated his duty to his client. Respondent failed to return the client's files
  after Respondent terminated the representation despite repeated requests by Mr. Hoffpauir and his new attorney.
  Respondent has violated his duty to the legal system by failing to cooperate with the disciplinary system. Respondent
  knowingly failed to respond to his client's repeated requests for his file. The file has been returned to Mr.
  Hoffpauir. Beyond the delay, there is no evidence of irreparable harm to the client. The record supports the
  aggravating factor of <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith obstruction</span> of the disciplinary proceeding by
  intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency (9.22(e)). The mitigating factor is
  <span class="ABAstandard">no prior disciplinary record</span> (9.32(a)).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanction (herein "Standard") suggests a public reprimand
  is appropriate when "a lawyer negligently engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional,
  and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public or the legal system" Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">7.3</span>. Respondent failure to timely return Mr. Hoffpauir's file appears to be an
  isolated incident from which Respondent initially failed to cooperate with ODC. However, Respondent did return the
  client's file, there is no permanent injury and he began to cooperate with ODC. The ABA Standards suggest the
  appropriate sanction is a public reprimand.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the case of <span class="cite"><i>In re: Charles R. Browning</i>, No.
  <a href="1999-06-03_98-DB-070.htm">98-DB-070</a></span>, formal charges were filed for Browning's failure to pay a
  third party medical provider and failure to cooperate with ODC. Respondent and ODC entered a joint petition for
  consent discipline recommending a public reprimand for violating 1.15(b)(failure to promptly deliver client funds),
  8.1(c) and 8.4(g). Respondent contended that the medical provider had agreed to offset the payment against what the
  medical provider owed respondent and that was the cause for his failure to pay the medical provider. As part of the
  consent discipline, Respondent agreed to pay the medical provider. The public reprimand was accepted.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the case of <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Dennis K. Dolbear</i>, No.
  <a href="1999-02-24_98-DB-061.htm">98-DB-061</a></span>, respondent entered a petition for consent discipline prior
  to formal charges. Respondent failed to return a file in a criminal matter when respondent's services were not
  engaged. Respondent admitted that he lost the file and that he failed to cooperate with ODC. Additionally,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent accepted $2,000 from four Mexican nationals to gain their release from jail.
  Respondent signed a contingency fee contract with them and assured them the return of their money if he did not
  obtain their release. Respondent did not obtain their release and he did not return their money. He also failed to
  cooperate with ODC. The Board found prior misconduct (admonition for failure to cooperate), failure to cooperate,
  vulnerability of victims and substantial experience in the practice of law as aggravating factors. The Board found
  the absence of a selfish motive as the only mitigating factor and noted that respondent returned the money after the
  complaint was filed. The public reprimand was accepted.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Case law and the A.B.A. Standards support a public reprimand since Respondent returned the file
  to Mr. Hoffpauir and if there is no irreparable damage because of the delay.</p>

  <h2>RULE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, the consent is accepted and therefore it is ordered that Richard Todd
  Hopes be publicly reprimanded for his violation of 1.16(d), 8.1(c) and 8.4(g) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.
  It is further ordered that the Respondent be assessed the costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal
  interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this Ruling until paid.</p>
