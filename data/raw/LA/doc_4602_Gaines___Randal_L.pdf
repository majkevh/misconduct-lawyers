<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 02-B-2454</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: RANDAL L. GAINES</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary proceeding arises from four counts of 
 formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) against 
 respondent, Randal L. Gaines, an attorney licensed to practice law in 
 Louisiana.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Prior to January 1, 2003, Supreme Court Rule XXX, Regulation 
 3.1 required members of the Louisiana State Bar Association (&quot;LSBA&quot;) to 
 complete a minimum of fifteen hours of mandatory continuing legal education (&quot;MCLE&quot;).<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> 
 If a member earned in excess of fifteen hours, he or she could carry no more 
 than ten hours forward for the next year. Rule XXX, Regulation 5.5.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In 1995, respondent earned thirty hours of MCLE. He 
 mistakenly believed fifteen of these hours could be carried over into 1996, 
 thus satisfying his requirements for that year. However, because he could not 
 carry over the full fifteen hours, respondent was not in compliance with his 
 MCLE obligation for 1996.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In April, 1997, respondent received a non-compliance notice 
 from the LSBA which indicated he had not fulfilled his MCLE requirements for 
 the 1996 reporting year. Respondent believed this letter, which was mistakenly 
 dated April 15, 1996, was sent in error and, therefore, he disregarded it.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In July, 1997, this court issued a notice certifying that 
 respondent was ineligible to practice law due to his failure to comply with his 
 1996 MCLE requirements, and providing that the certification of ineligibility 
 would become effective thirty days from the date of the notice unless 
 respondent established his compliance within that time. While the LSBA sent a 
 copy of this notice to respondent, respondent denies ever receiving such. 
 Because respondent did not comply with his obligations within the thirty day 
 period, he became ineligible to practice on August 8, 1997.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">From November, 1997 to June, 1998, while he was ineligible 
 to practice law, respondent represented Felechia Jones and her minor son. 
 Subsequently, Ms. Jones filed a complaint against respondent, alleging he had 
 failed to return her case file.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Ultimately, the ODC found no merit to the complaint and 
 wrote respondent advising that it would not pursue the complaint. However, in 
 the course of investigating the matter, the ODC determined respondent may have 
 been ineligible to practice during the representation and sought additional 
 information from respondent regarding his MCLE status. Believing the request 
 was relative to the Jones matter and that the ODC's investigation was no longer 
 pending, respondent did not respond. In November, 1998, the ODC issued a 
 subpoena to respondent ordering respondent&nbsp; to appear for a deposition. At 
 that time, respondent allegedly learned for the first time that he was 
 ineligible to practice based on his failure to complete his MCLE requirements.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In an effort to satisfy his outstanding MCLE obligations, 
 respondent attended a medical malpractice continuing legal education seminar in 
 December, 1998. Following the one-day seminar, respondent attested on his 
 attendance card that he was present for the full 7.2 hours of the program. 
 However, the registration records from the seminar indicate respondent arrived 
 late and was only present for 5.2 hours of the seminar.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, Kitty Hymel, in her capacity as MCLE 
 Administrator for the LSBA, sent a letter to respondent informing him that he 
 had not properly recorded his hours and noting this was the second time he had 
 done so. The letter stated that following the first incident he was verbally 
 cautioned not to repeat such misconduct. Upon concluding respondent's 
 misrepresentations were subject to discipline, she forwarded to the ODC a copy 
 of her letter directed to respondent.2</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed formal charges against 
 respondent alleging respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by 
 representing three clients while ineligible <a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> in 
 violation of Rule 5.5(a), as well as violated Rules 8.1(c) and 8.4(g) through 
 his failure to cooperate in the disciplinary investigation in the Jones matter. 
 Finally, the ODC alleged respondent violated Rule 1.1(b) by failing to comply 
 with his MCLE requirements, and violated Rule 8.4(c) by engaging in conduct 
 involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation in connection with 
 his reporting of his MCLE hours.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an answer to the formal charges admitting 
 that he engaged in the unauthorized practice of law when he handled the three 
 client matters. However, he alleged he was unaware of his ineligibility since 
 he had never received notice from this court or the LSBA of his non-compliance. 
 Respondent conceded that he received notice in April, 1997 of his failure to 
 satisfy his obligations, but the letter was dated April, 1996, one year 
 earlier. Respondent claimed, since he had earned thirty hours of continuing 
 legal education in 1995, he presumed the letter dated 1996 was sent out in 
 error and took no action to respond. As to his alleged failure to cooperate in 
 the investigation of the Jones matter, respondent stated the ODC advised him it 
 had closed its investigatory file following his return of Ms. Jones' file. He 
 maintained he neglected to respond to the ODC's request for information after 
 that time because he believed the request was sent in error. Finally, as to his 
 misrepresentations on his MCLE attendance cards, respondent admitted he had 
 arrived at the two seminars late and reported that he attended the total hours 
 offered. However, he alleged that he expected the seminar sponsors to 
 recalculate the hours.</p>
<h3>Formal Hearing</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">A formal hearing was conducted and several persons 
 testified. Specifically, Ms. Hymel testified regarding the LSBA's procedure 
 relative to notifying its members of their MCLE noncompliance. Specifically, 
 she alleged that her office sends out three notices to attorneys between 
 December and July regarding the MCLE hours earned. Specifically, in April, 
 transcripts are mailed via certified mail to all attorneys who are 
 noncompliant. She testified, while her office sends the letters out via 
 certified mail, return receipts are not requested due to the excessive expense 
 and because the notices are forwarded to the addresses provided annually by the 
 attorneys on their Rule XIX attorney registration statement. Ms. Hymel stated 
 that, if the attorneys do not comply as a result of the April notice, sixty 
 days later her office provides a list of noncompliant members to this court to 
 send notices of administrative ineligibility. Finally, Ms. Hymel testified, 
 following the first occasion respondent misrepresented the facts on his 
 continuing legal education seminar attendance card, she contacted his office by 
 telephone and advised him not to misreport his MCLE hours again. When he 
 disregarded her advice and misrepresented information a second time, she filed 
 a complaint with the ODC.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's testimony paralleled his response to the formal 
 charges. Additionally, he offered evidence in mitigation of his misconduct. 
 Particularly, respondent noted his twenty year service in the Army National 
 Guard. He also expressed remorse for his misconduct relative to his failure to 
 monitor and comply with his MCLE.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-048.HC --#">Recommendation of the Hearing Committee</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee determined the ODC proved by clear and 
 convincing evidence violations of Rule 1.1(b) (failure to comply with MCLE 
 requirements) and, Rule 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving deceit, 
 dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation). Notwithstanding, it concluded there 
 was insufficient evidence that respondent violated Rule 5.5(a) (engaging in the 
 unauthorized practice of law) since it was not established he received the 
 notices of his ineligibility. As to the Jones complaint, the committee found 
 there was no evidence to show respondent violated Rules 8.1(c) (failure to 
 cooperate in a disciplinary investigation) and 8.4(g) (failure to cooperate 
 with the ODC). In support, it relied on the fact the ODC had advised respondent 
 its investigation into the Jones complaint had been closed and, subsequently, 
 it was reopened without notice to respondent.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Addressing the issue of sanctions, the committee recognized 
 the existence of prior discipline <a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> as an 
 aggravating factor. Further, in light of the two incidents of misrepresentation 
 relative to his MCLE attendance, the committee questioned respondent's 
 veracity, and considered dishonest or selfish motive as an aggravating factor. 
 In mitigation, the committee noted timely good faith effort to rectify 
 consequences of misconduct, full and free disclosure to disciplinary board, 
 character and reputation, and remorse. Finding the mitigating factors outweigh 
 the aggravating factors, the committee recommended imposition of a public 
 reprimand and additional continuing legal education.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-048.BD --#">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board adopted the factual findings of the 
 hearing committee in most respects. However, it found the committee erred in 
 finding respondent did not engage in the unauthorized practice of law in 
 violation of Rule 5.5(a). In support, it noted that respondent admitted, in 
 April, 1997, he received the noncompliance notice for the 1996 reporting year. 
 In addition, it relied on the testimony of Ms. Hymel that preliminary 
 transcripts of continuing legal education hours are mailed to members of the 
 Bar every December. The board pointed out that &quot;[i]t is incumbent upon members 
 of the legal profession to be aware of the requirements for eligibility in the 
 Louisiana State Bar Association, to comply with those requirements, and to be 
 aware of the consequences of failure to comply.&quot; Thus, it concluded respondent 
 engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in handling the three client 
 matters at issue in this litigation.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In addressing the issue of sanctions, the board found 
 respondent violated duties owed to his clients, the public and as a 
 professional. It agreed with the committee that respondent knew or should have 
 known that his conduct was in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. 
 While it determined the injury to not be great, the board found &quot;the conduct of 
 respondent to be disturbing.&quot; The board adopted the aggravating and mitigating 
 factors cited by the committee. Upon consideration of these factors, the board 
 recommended respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of 
 three months, fully deferred, subject to seven hours of continuing legal 
 education in addition to his regular MCLE requirement.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an objection in this court to the 
 recommendation of the disciplinary board. As a result, the matter was docketed 
 for briefing and argument in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 11(G).</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record clearly establishes that respondent violated Rule
 <span class="Rules">1.1(b)</span> by failing to fulfill his MCLE requirements 
 and violated Rule <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span> by engaging in conduct 
 involving misrepresentation in connection with the reporting of his MCLE hours. 
 However, respondent has consistently maintained that he has not engaged in the 
 unauthorized practice of law in violation of Rule 5.5(a) because he never 
 received notices of his ineligibility. The hearing committee made a factual 
 finding that respondent was unaware he was ineligible to practice, but the 
 disciplinary board reversed this finding on the ground it was clearly wrong.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As we explained in <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Bolton</i>, 
 02-0257 at p. 7 (La. 6/21/02), <a href="#!-- #ID:820%20So.2d%20548 --#">820 
 So.2d 548</a>, 553</span>, unlike the disciplinary board and this court, the 
 hearing committee is not disadvantaged by the review of a cold record and is in 
 a superior position to observe the nuances of demeanor evidence not revealed in 
 a record. Although this court is the trier of fact in bar disciplinary cases, 
 we are not prepared to disregard the credibility evaluations made by those 
 committee members who were present during respondent's testimony and who act as 
 the eyes and ears of this court. <i>Id</i>. Therefore, we cannot say the 
 hearing committee was clearly wrong when it determined that respondent was 
 credible when he testified he did not receive notice of his ineligibility.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, we note that Rule 
 1.1(b) falls within the general rule that an attorney must provide competent 
 representation. This court has enacted the mandatory continuing legal education 
 rules to ensure that members of the profession remain current in the law and 
 able to discharge their professional obligations to their clients. Therefore, a 
 violation of these rules should not be treated lightly.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's misrepresentation in connection with the 
 reporting of his MCLE hours is also disturbing. Although respondent's initial 
 misreporting of his hours may have been a result of a good faith mistake, he 
 was advised of his error by the MCLE administrator and told not to do so again. 
 Respondent chose to disregard this advice and misreport his hours a second 
 time. Such conduct falls far short of the high standards of honesty imposed on 
 attorneys practicing in this state. See, e.g., <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana 
 State Bar Ass'n v. Haylon</i>, 250 La. 651,
 <a href="#!-- #ID:198%20So.2d%20391 --#">198 So. 2d 391</a> (1967)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, we find the baseline sanction for 
 respondent's misconduct is a suspension. As aggravating factors, we recognize 
 the existence of prior discipline and dishonest or selfish motive. In 
 mitigation, we note respondent made a timely good faith effort to rectify 
 consequences of misconduct, gave full and free disclosure to disciplinary 
 board, and has demonstrated character and reputation, and remorse.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering the case as a whole, we conclude a three-month 
 suspension from the practice of law is the appropriate discipline. In light of 
 the mitigating factors, we will defer this suspension in its entirety, subject 
 to the condition that during the calendar year 2003, respondent complete an 
 extra seven hours of continuing legal education, in addition to his ordinary 
 MCLE requirements for the year.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the 
 hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, briefs, 
 and oral argument, it is ordered that Randal L. Gaines be suspended from the 
 practice of law in Louisiana for a period of three months. This suspension 
 shall be fully deferred, subject to the condition that respondent complete an 
 extra seven hours of continuing legal education during the calendar year of 
 2003, in addition to his ordinary mandatory continuing legal education 
 requirements for the year. Respondent is ordered to submit proof of compliance 
 to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. All costs and expenses in the matter are 
 assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10.1, 
 with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of the finality of 
 this court's judgment until paid.</p>
<hr>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> Effective January 1, 2003, the 
 minimum requirement has been changed to 12.5 hours. This change was necessary 
 because the length of an instructional hour was increased from fifty minutes to 
 sixty minutes.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> In accordance with the LSBA's MCLE 
 policy, at each continuing legal education seminar offered in Louisiana, all 
 attorneys must execute course cards attesting to his attendance for the hours 
 reported. Specifically, the cards provide:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="footnotetext">I attest that I did attend the above CLE activity for 
   the full number of hours reported. I understand that a false statement or a 
   misrepresentation is subject to a disciplinary action pursuant to Rule 9 of 
   the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="footnotetext">Respondent executed such cards attesting to his full 
 attendance at the continuing legal education programs for which he arrived 
 tardy.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> In addition to his representation of 
 Ms. Jones, the ODC determined that respondent represented Tammy Taylor from 
 October 17, 1997 to July 24, 1998, as well as Maude and Earnest Gethers from 
 August 8, 1997 to February 22, 1999.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> The committee recognized respondent 
 received a public reprimand and a conditional one year probation stemming from 
 his criminal conviction for unauthorized use of Southern University payroll 
 funds. See, <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Gaines</i>,
 <a href="#!-- #ID:92-DB-038.BD --#">92-DB-038</a>.</span> Moreover, it pointed 
 out respondent had been rendered ineligible on two other occasions for failure 
 to comply with his LSBA requirements: 6/1/92 - 6/29/92 - nonpayment of bar 
 dues; 1/1/94 - 9/9/94 - failure to file a Rule XIX attorney registration 
 statement and nonpayment of a disciplinary fee.</p>
