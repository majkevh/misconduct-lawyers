  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2003-06-04_02-DB-008.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing, the hearing committee made the following factual findings:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Riley matter – In November 1999, Ms. Riley hired respondent to handle her personal injury case, which settled on June 25, 2000 for $3,558.25. Respondent did not notify Ms. Riley of the settlement and forged her endorsement on the check. Ms. Riley learned of the settlement after contacting the insurance company's claims adjuster. Ms. Riley did not hear from respondent until she met with him on October 24, 2000, when she signed a release and received a $1,200 check as her portion of the settlement proceeds. Ms. Riley never received a disbursement sheet. Respondent failed to respond to Ms. Riley's complaint filed with the ODC.

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Morris matter – Mr. Morris paid respondent $700 to handle his bankruptcy. Respondent failed to appear at any of the court hearings and creditors meetings.

He also failed to appear on the designated date to give a sworn statement to the ODC; however, he appeared on June 15, 2001 to provide the sworn statement.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Barnes matter – Mr. Barnes paid respondent $485 to handle his bankruptcy. Respondent filed at least three bankruptcy petitions in Mr. Barnes' name, two of which were without Mr. Barnes' consent or signature. All three bankruptcies were dismissed due to respondent's errors. Respondent also failed to pay the filing fee. He subsequently admitted that he was not capable of properly handling bankruptcy matters. Respondent failed to respond to Mr. Barnes' complaint filed with the ODC. He also failed to appear on the designated date to give a sworn statement to the ODC; however, he appeared on June 15, 2001 to provide the sworn statement.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Jones matter – In December 2000, Ms. Jones paid respondent $540 to handle her father's succession. Thereafter, respondent never contacted Ms. Jones and abandoned his law practice. After Ms. Jones filed a complaint against him with the ODC, respondent refunded her money and provided her with inaccurate and incompetently prepared pleadings, which resulted in her having to hire another attorney to handle the succession. Respondent failed to respond to Ms. Jones' complaint filed with the ODC. He also failed to appear on the designated date to give a sworn statement to the ODC; however, he appeared on June 15, 2001 to provide the sworn statement.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Katz matter – Respondent referred a number of his clients to Dr. Steven Katz for treatment. Respondent failed to pay Dr. Katz after his clients' cases settled. Respondent has admitted having knowledge of Dr. Katz' interest in these cases; nonetheless, no payments have been made to Dr. Katz on the settled cases. Respondent failed to respond to Dr. Katz' complaint filed with the ODC. Therefore, he was subpoenaed to provide a sworn statement. The ODC allowed him to respond in writing instead. However, respondent failed to respond to the ODC's subsequent requests for information.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Lightell matter – Nolan and Leatia Lightell paid respondent $700 in filing costs and attorney's fees to handle their bankruptcy. Thereafter, respondent never communicated with the Lightells and failed to file the bankruptcy. The Lightells were forced to hire another attorney to handle the bankruptcy, and respondent has not refunded any of their money. Respondent failed to respond to the Lightells' complaint filed with the ODC. He also failed to appear to give a sworn statement to the ODC.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Pearl matter – Michael and Karen Pearl hired respondent to handle two workers' compensation cases and a bankruptcy matter, which was to be filed because the Pearls were behind on their home mortgage. In January 2001, Mr. Pearl's case settled for $55,000. Respondent gave Mr. Pearl a check for $18,000 and advised him he would use $26,000 to pay their home mortgage current. In February 2001, the Pearls received a foreclosure notice and learned that respondent had not made the $26,000 payment on their mortgage. Respondent stole the $26,000 and is presently under investigation by the Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office. As a result of respondent's actions, the Pearls' home was foreclosed upon. They became homeless and had to move in with their respective parents, splitting up the family living situation. Respondent failed to respond to the Pearls' complaint filed with the ODC. He also informed the ODC that he would not give a sworn statement, despite being subpoenaed to do so.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these findings, the committee determined that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges. Respondent's neglect caused serious harm to his clients, especially the Pearls, who lost their home, became homeless, and had their family split as a result of his misconduct. Respondent stole $26,000 from Mr. Pearl's workers' compensation settlement. Respondent also took $700 from the Lightells and did no work on their legal matter. Respondent further failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigations of these complaints. Relying on the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the committee determined that the baseline sanction is disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In aggravation, the committee found a dishonest or selfish motive, a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, vulnerability of the victim, and indifference to making restitution. As a mitigating factor, the committee recognized that respondent has no prior disciplinary record, but noted that respondent was admitted to the practice of law in April 1999 and his pattern of misconduct began as early as October 2000.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, the committee recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>02-DB-133</h2>

In acting as he did, respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Bell matter – Respondent neglected Mr. Bell's legal matters by failing to be prompt and prepared for court appearances. He failed to communicate with his client and failed to attend scheduled meetings. He also relocated to Georgia and failed to notify Mr. Bell that he would no longer be representing him. When he did speak to Mr. Bell, respondent falsely informed him that his lawsuits were filed and up to date. Respondent also failed to respond to Mr. Bell's complaint filed with the ODC. In acting as he did, respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Lott/Seago matter – When Mr. Lott's legal matter settled, respondent deposited the settlement funds into his own personal account, thereby converting client funds. Respondent also failed to pay Mr. Seago, a third party lien holder. Respondent invoked a concursus proceeding but failed to deposit the settlement funds into the registry of the court and failed to appear for a hearing. Respondent paid Mr. Lott $500 but failed to adequately account for the remaining $9,500 of the settlement. Respondent also failed to respond to Mr. Seago's complaint filed with the ODC or appear for a sworn statement. In acting as he did, respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Ryles matter – Respondent neglected Mr. Ryles' legal matters and failed to communicate with Mr. Ryles. Furthermore, respondent abandoned his practice without informing his client. Respondent also failed to respond to Mr. Ryles' complaint filed with the ODC or appear for a sworn statement. In acting as he did, respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these findings, the committee determined that respondent knowingly violated duties owed to his clients, the public, and as a professional. His misconduct harmed his clients by delaying their legal matters, thus causing them frustration, and by depriving them of their funds. Relying on the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the committee determined that disbarment is the baseline sanction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the committee found a dishonest or selfish motive, a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, vulnerability of the victims, and indifference to making restitution. The committee found no mitigating factors present.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the above findings and this court's prior jurisprudence, the committee recommended that respondent be disbarred. The committee also recommended that respondent provide complete accountings and make full restitution to his victims. Finally, the committee recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these determinations, the board found that respondent violated duties owed to his clients, the public, and as a professional. Respondent acted intentionally and caused substantial harm to his clients, the most egregious being the harm caused to the Pearls.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V, § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. 
	<span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), 
	<a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; 
	<span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall, 
	<a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings. See 
	<span class="cite">In re: Caulfield, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), 
	<a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; 
	<span class="cite">In re: Pardue, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94), 
	<a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The testimony, evidence, and deemed admitted facts support the hearing committees' and disciplinary board's findings in these consolidated matters. Respondent failed to provide competent representation to his clients, neglected his clients' legal matters, failed to communicate with his clients, failed to refund approximately $2,600 in unearned fees, converted approximately $41,000 of client and third-party funds to his own use, engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, abandoned his law practice when he relocated to Georgia without notice to his clients, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in numerous investigations.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found evidence of professional misconduct, we now turn to a determination of the appropriate sanction for respondent's actions. In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. 
	<span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis, 
	<a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. 
	<span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington, 
	<a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The baseline sanction for this type of misconduct is clearly disbarment. Therefore, the only issue presented for our consideration is whether respondent's misconduct is so egregious as to warrant permanent disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Supreme Court Rule XIX, Appendix E depicts conduct that may warrant permanent disbarment. We agree with the disciplinary board that Guideline 1 (repeated or multiple instances of intentional conversion of client funds with substantial harm) is applicable in this matter. Respondent intentionally converted funds belonging to Ms. Riley, Dr. Katz, the Pearls, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Seago. Restitution has not been made to these clients and third parties, and the Pearls in particular were significantly harmed by respondent's conversion.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The intentional conversion of client funds, coupled with the numerous other acts of misconduct, indicates that respondent lacks the requisite honesty and integrity to practice law. Furthermore, the solitary mitigating factor present in this case – the absence of a prior disciplinary record – is significantly outweighed by the applicable aggravating factors.<a class="fn" href="#fn3" name="fnref3" id="fnref3">3</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Prior jurisprudence reveals that similar cases have resulted in permanent disbarment.<a class="fn" href="#fn4" name="fnref4" id="fnref4">4</a> Accordingly, respondent must be permanently disbarred.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committees and disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that the name of Jeffery Anthony Favors, Louisiana Bar Roll number 26029, be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked. Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered that respondent be permanently prohibited from being readmitted to the practice of law in this state. It is further ordered that respondent provide accountings and make restitution to his victims. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
