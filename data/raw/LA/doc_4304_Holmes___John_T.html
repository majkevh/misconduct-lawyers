NO. 98-B-3008<br>
IN RE:&nbsp; JOHN T. HOLMES</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>PER CURIAM.</p>
<p>*************************************************************************************</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This case arises from a petition for </font>consent discipline <font size="3">filed by respondent, John T. Holmes.&nbsp; Respondent has stipulated to converting funds belonging to third party medical providers, and seeks an eighteen month suspension from the practice of law.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The underlying facts are not in dispute.&nbsp; Respondent and Patrick Leitz</font><span class="CITE"><font size="1"> 1</font></span><font size="3">were partners in the law firm of Leitz, Kurzweg, and Holmes.&nbsp; Respondent was responsible for disbursements from the law firm's trust account.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In two separate instances occurring in 1992 and 1993, Leitz obtained settlements on behalf of clients.&nbsp; Respondent placed the funds in the firm's trust account, and clients were paid their share of the settlements.&nbsp; Although respondent deducted medical expenses in the amount of $2,000 and $4,351 <font size="3">respectively from the settlements, he failed to pay the third party medical providers.</font><span class="CITE"><font size="1">2</font></span><font size="3">&nbsp; Respondent stipulated that these funds were improperly placed in the operating account of the firm, in violation of </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">RULE <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15'></a><font size="3">&nbsp; of the Rules of Professional.</font><font size="1"> </font><span class="CITE">3</span><p>
<p><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;July 17, 1998, pursuant to a joint petition filed by respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;), this court placed respondent on interim suspension. </font><span class="CITE"> In re Holmes, 98-1892 (La. 7/17/98), 717 So.2d 1126.</span>Prior to the filing of formal charges, respondent filed a petition for consent discipline in which he admitted to converting and failing to safeguard third party funds.&nbsp; As a sanction, respondent proposed that he be suspended from the practice of law for a period of eighteen months.&nbsp; The ODC concurred in the petition for consent discipline, and the matter was submitted to the disciplinary board pursuant to <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s20'><font size="3">, </font><p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subsequently, the <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A71e1?an=JD_98-DB-046 --##'>disciplinary board</a> recommended that the consent discipline be adopted.&nbsp; While the board recognized no clients were injured by respondent's conduct, it found the third party providers were deprived of funds for a protracted period of time.&nbsp; It concluded the proposed consent discipline was </font></p>
<p><font size="3">appropriate and consistent with other cases from this court involving similar facts.</font><font size="1">4</font><font size="3">&nbsp; Accordingly, the board recommended respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of eighteen months effective from the date of his July 17, 1998 interim suspension. </font>Neither respondent nor the ODC have filed objections in this court to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>
<p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p><font size="3">As the board recognized, no client funds were converted by respondent.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="3">However, respondent admitted to converting third party funds by placing these funds in the firm's operating account.&nbsp; The third parties were eventually paid, but were deprived of their funds for a protracted period of time.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, and considering the prior jurisprudence of this court, the proposed suspension of eighteen months is appropriate.</font></p>
<p><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the record herein, it is the decision of this court that respondent, John T. Holmes, be </font>suspended <font size="3">from the practice of law for a period of</font> eighteen months<font size="3">, effective from the date of his July 17, 1998 interim suspension.&nbsp; All costs of this proceeding are assessed against respondent, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of the finality of this judgment until paid.</font></p>
<p class='footnotetitle'>FOOTNOTES:</p>
<p class='footnote'><font size="1">1</font><font size="3">. Leitz filed a separate petition for consent discipline for conduct arising </font>out of this matter, which is pending before this court in 98-B-3014.</p>
<p class='footnote'><font size="1">2</font><font size="3">&nbsp; It appears the providers were eventually paid by Leitz, but only after a </font>protracted period of time.</p>
<p class='footnote'>Rule 1.15 provides in pertinent part:</p>
<p class='footnote'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in the lawyer's possession in connection with representation separate from the lawyer's own property.</p>
