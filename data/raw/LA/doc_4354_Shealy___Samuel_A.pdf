  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: SAMUEL A. SHEALY</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM. <a name="fnref_" href="#fn_" id="fnref_">(FN*)</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">     This disciplinary proceeding arises from one count of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Samuel A. Shealy, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State
  of Louisiana.  The charges alleged that respondent had been convicted of a criminal offense which constituted serious
  criminal  conduct in violation of Rule <span class="Rules">8.4(b)</span> of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The underlying facts indicate that on September 29, 1994, respondent pleaded guilty in the United
  States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana to one count of willful failure to file an income tax
  return for the year 1988 in violation of 26 U.S.C. s 7203, a misdemeanor. <a name="fnref1" href="#fn1"
  id="fnref1">(FN1)</a>  The record indicates that in 1988, respondent had earned a gross income of $29,568 that he
  failed to report.  On December 15, 1994, the district court sentenced respondent to eight months in a federal
  facility followed by one year of supervised probation.  Subsequently, respondent was incarcerated in a federal prison
  in Texarcana, Texas for eight months and spent a period in a halfway house in Monroe.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Prior to his plea of guilty, respondent voluntarily resigned his position as an Assistant
  District Attorney for Lincoln Parish and as a Lincoln Parish School Board Member, positions which he had held for
  several years.  Since 1983, respondent held a position as a part-time instructor of Business Law at Louisiana Tech
  University, which he relinquished at the time of his incarceration.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On May 12, 1995, prior to the institution of formal charges, respondent filed a petition for
  consent discipline, seeking a two year suspension, deferred, with the imposition of several conditions.  Although the
  ODC filed a concurrence, <span class="cite"><a href="../DB/1995-08-23_95-DB-020.htm">the disciplinary
  board</a></span> rejected the proposed consent discipline after conducting a hearing.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent.  After respondent
  failed to answer, the matter was submitted to <span class="cite"><a href="../HC/1996-08-16_95-DB-036.htm">the hearing
  committee</a></span> on the briefs.  Citing mitigating factors, such as evidence of respondent's remorse and good
  character, the hearing committee recommended the same discipline proposed in the previously rejected petition for
  consent discipline:  a two year deferred suspension, with said suspension being deferred, and the imposition of
  certain conditions.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/0000-00-00_95-DB-036.htm">The disciplinary board</a></span>, in
  its recommendation to this court, concluded that respondent had violated a duty owed to the public and compromised
  the public integrity of the judicial system when he intentionally broke the law while engaged as an assistant
  district attorney.  Moreover, it noted that the tax loss to the government resulted in actual injury.  Relying on s
  <span class="ABAstandard">5.12</span> of the <i>ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions,</i> the board noted the
  baseline sanction was suspension.  As aggravating factors, it found the presence of a
  <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest and selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">a pattern of
  misconduct</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">the substantial
  experience in the practice of law</span>.  As mitigating factors, the board found respondent had made a
  <span class="ABAstandard">timely good faith effort to make restitution</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">cooperated
  with the ODC</span>, had excellent <span class="ABAstandard">character and reputation</span> in the community, showed
  <span class="ABAstandard">remorsefulness</span> and had <span class="ABAstandard">no prior disciplinary
  record</span>.  Additionally, it noted there had been an <span class="ABAstandard">imposition of other
  penalties</span> (i.e., eight month incarceration and probation) and the <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior
  disciplinary record</span>.  Based on these factors, the board recommended that respondent be suspended for a period
  of one year and one day, with suspension deferred, upon imposition of a two year probation subject to certain
  conditions.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, the ODC filed an objection in this court to the disciplinary board's
  recommendation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Initially, we note that the recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board were
  rendered prior to the release of our decisions in <span class="CITE"><i>In Re:  Hilry Huckaby, III</i>, 96-2643
  (La.5/20/97), <a href="1997-05-20_1996-2643.htm">694 So.2d 906</a>,</span> and <span class="CITE"><i>In Re:  Elvis
  Stout</i>, 97-0217 (La.5/20/97), <a href="1997-05-20_1997-0217.htm">694 So.2d 908</a>,</span> which imposed actual
  suspensions in disciplinary proceedings arising from a misdemeanor failure to file conviction.  Based upon our review
  of the record, we feel the facts of the instant matter are similar enough to those in Huckaby and <i>Stout</i> to
  warrant an actual period of suspension.  As in Huckaby and <i>Stout</i>, respondent was charged and convicted under
  26 U.S.C. s 7203, misdemeanor failure to file a tax return.  Similarly, respondent failed to file tax returns for
  several years (nine) and failed to pay taxes in a significant amount.  Moreover, respondent was sentenced to an
  actual prison term and placed on probation.  While it is true that respondent did not hold judicial office at the
  time he committed his offense, he was a member of the Lincoln Parish School Board, counsel for the Lincoln Parish
  Police Jury, and an Assistant District Attorney for that parish.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the similarity of <i>Huckaby</i> and <i>Stout</i> to the instant matter, and weighing
  the aggravating and mitigating factors, we conclude that a suspension of twelve months, with all but six months
  deferred and two years probation under the terms imposed by the disciplinary board is appropriate discipline under
  the facts of this case.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the hearing committee and disciplinary board findings and recommendations, and
  considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is the decision of this court that the recommendation of the
  disciplinary board be modified to impose an actual period of suspension.  Accordingly, it is ordered that respondent,
  Samuel A. Shealy, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of twelve months, with all but six months of the
  suspension deferred.  Following completion of the active portion of the suspension, respondent shall be placed on two
  years supervised probation subject to the following conditions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) Respondent shall comply with all Rules of Professional Conduct during the probationary
    period;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2) An attorney will be appointed pursuant to the disciplinary board's probation system to
    monitor respondent's practice on a periodic basis and provide quarterly written reports to the Office of
    Disciplinary Counsel during the probationary period;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) Respondent will complete all required mandatory continuing legal education hours during the
    two year period of probation, of which three hours of the fifteen hours required each year shall be in the area of
    law office management;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) Respondent will allow disciplinary counsel and/or the probation monitor to review financial
    statements and records of respondent's operating and trust accounts;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(5) Respondent will retain a certified public accountant to review his operating and trust
    accounts and file reports with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel on a quarterly basis and see to it that all state
    and federal taxes are paid, any payment schedules for tax liability are current, and that all client funds are
    disbursed and protected in an orderly manner;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(6) Respondent will develop a law office management plan which meets with the approval of his
    probation monitor;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(7) Respondent will pay all costs of these proceedings, said payment to be completed prior to
    termination of the probationary period;  and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(8) Upon respondent's failure to comply with any of the terms of this probation, disciplinary
    counsel shall move for an immediate revocation of probation.  Disciplinary counsel's motion to revoke probation
    shall be filed directly with the disciplinary board for summary consideration by whatever procedure the board deems
    appropriate.</p>

  s 3.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">FN1</a>. The presentence report in the record indicates
  that between 1982 and 1990 (with the exception of 1985), respondent failed to timely file his tax returns.  He filed
  extensions for the years 1984, and 1986--1990.  When respondent received notice in February 1994 by the IRS that his
  failure to file was being considered for criminal prosecution, he filed his returns for the delinquent years 1986
  through 1990, and timely filed for 1991.  Along with his 1992 returns, respondent submitted full restitution for his
  outstanding tax liability and part of the interest balance owing totalling $63,418.24.  At the time of his December
  1994 sentencing, respondent had still not filed his tax returns for the years 1982 through 1984, nor paid any
  applicable taxes for those years.  Respondent was not subject to criminal prosecution for his failure to file for
  these years because of prescription.</p>
