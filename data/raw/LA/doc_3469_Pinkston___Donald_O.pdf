</P>
<P CLASS='BOARDCAPTION'><B>RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD<BR />
</B></P>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a disciplinary proceeding based upon the filing of formal charges against the Respondent, Donald O. Pinkston of New Orleans, Louisiana, under Docket No. 95-DB-<B>034, </B>for failing to communicate with clients, misleading clients as to the status of a case and failing to return an unearned fee (Count 1), and for improperly commingling Respondent's funds with those of his clients' (Count II).&nbsp; The charges stem from complaints filed with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel by the Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office, Child Support Division on March 1, 1995 and a complaint filed <B>by</B> James and Marilyn Smith on May 6, 1995.</P>
<P><B>I PROCEDURAL HISTORY</B></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="BodyText"><FONT COLOR=#000000><B>FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF FORMAL CHARGES</SPAN></B></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="BodyText"><FONT COLOR=#000000>The facts relating to Respondent's formal charges are taken from the findings of the Hearing Committee and can be summarized as follows:</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="BodyText"><FONT COLOR=#000000><B>Count I</SPAN></B></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="BodyText"><FONT COLOR=#000000>Marilyn Washington Smith retained Respondent on 3-30-95 to represent her husband in connection with a parole violation hearing.&nbsp; Mrs. Smith testified that Respondent promised he would have the hearing rescheduled within 30 days.&nbsp; Her testimony is affirmed by the testimony of her mother-in-law and David Boykins, both of whom were present during her initial meeting with Respondent.&nbsp; Respondent corresponded with the parole board on 4-6-95 requesting a hearing.&nbsp; The Parole Board responded on 6-1-95 and informed Respondent that Smith would not be eligible for a hearing prior to 9-29-95.&nbsp; Respondent has no documentation that he mailed this letter to his clients.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="BodyText"><FONT COLOR=#000000>Respondent testified that he quit working on the Smith case when received a copy of James Smith's complaint to Disciplinary Counsel on 6-6-95.&nbsp; Respondent believed he earned the $240 fee paid by Mrs. Smith because he wrote a letter to the Parole Board, visited with Smith's probation officer and visited Smith once in jail.&nbsp; Respondent admits that when he received Smith's complaint that he knew Smith wanted a refund.&nbsp; Respondent did not remove the disputed funds from his operating account and place the amount in his trust account.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="BodyText"><FONT COLOR=#000000><B>Count II</SPAN></B></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="BodyText"><FONT COLOR=#000000>Respondent admits that 2 checks were written on his client trust account for his personal benefit.&nbsp; Respondent testified that he never intended to commingle his personal funds with that of his clients and was not fully aware of what commingling actually was at the time he wrote the checks.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="BodyText"><FONT COLOR=#000000><B>RECOMMENDATION OF THE HEARING COMMITTEE</SPAN></B></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="BodyText"><FONT COLOR=#000000>At the meeting of Hearing Committee No. 8, consisting of Dominick Scandurro, Jr., chairman; H. Eustis Reily, public member; and Jack A. Grant, lawyer member, on November 1 6, 1 995, Respondent appeared and offered testimony on both counts, but did not contest the formally charged allegations in count IL</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="BodyText"><FONT COLOR=#000000><B>Count I</SPAN></B></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="BodyText"><FONT COLOR=#000000>The </FONT><A HREF='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Ad8ee?an=JD_HC9534 --##'>Hearing Committee found</A><FONT COLOR=#000000> that while Respondent made a commitment to the Complainant to have her husband's parole revocation scheduled within a short period of time, as evidenced by Mrs. Smith's continued inquiries to Respondent regarding the date of the hearing, parole hearings are not within the control of the attorney, and as such, Respondent could not guarantee a hearing.&nbsp; Respondent bore the sole responsibility to adequately communicate this to his client and to keep the client informed as to the progress of the case.&nbsp; Further, the Hearing Committee held that Respondent did not earn the $240.00 fee because the contract stated &quot;parole violation hearing only&quot; and Respondent did not attend the hearing scheduled for September 29, 1995.&nbsp; He did talk to a parole officer and write a letter to the Parole Board, but the Hearing Committee concluded that based on the written contract, those actions were insufficient to justify not returning his client's fee.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="BodyText"><FONT COLOR=#000000><B>Count II</SPAN></B></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="BodyText"><FONT COLOR=#000000>Respondent did not contest the facts under this count, and he admits that the two checks written on his client trust account were for his personal use.&nbsp; He testified that he never intended to commingle his funds with his clients' funds, and that he was not fully aware of what commingling actually was at the time the checks were written.</SPAN></FONT></P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="BodyText"><FONT COLOR=#000000>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Following receipt of the Hearing Committee's report, and prior to submission of this matter to a panel of the Disciplinary Board, Respondent furnished evidence that he had refunded the $240 fee to Mrs. Smith.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="BodyText"><FONT COLOR=#000000>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, the Disciplinary Board orders that the Respondent, Donald O. Pinkston, be</FONT> reprimanded<FONT COLOR=#000000> and assessed with all costs of these proceedings.</SPAN></FONT></P>
