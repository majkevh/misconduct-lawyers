<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 01-B-3106</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: BLAIR DAVID CONDOLL</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<p class="bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from nine 
 counts of formal charges<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> filed by the Office of 
 Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Blair David Condoll, an 
 attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana.</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<h3>Gray Matter</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">In November 1998, Joan Gray (as guardian of and on behalf of 
 her two minor grandchildren) and Veronica Tillman retained respondent to 
 represent them in a personal injury matter against Ms. Gray’s insurance 
 carrier. After being retained, respondent failed to answer his clients’ 
 requests for information. Without notice to his clients, respondent settled the 
 personal injury claims of the minor children and Ms. Tillman for $7,000. Upon 
 receiving the settlement checks, he endorsed his clients’ names without the 
 proper consent and authority and deposited them into his office account. 
 Respondent failed to disburse any funds to his clients or their medical 
 provider, despite having guaranteed payment for $2,315 in medical services 
 rendered to his clients.</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<p class="bodycopy">Upon learning of the settlement from her insurance carrier, 
 Ms. Gray filed a complaint with the ODC. In the course of the investigation, 
 respondent gave a sworn statement conceding he failed to communicate with his 
 clients. He maintained no funds were due his clients after deduction of his 
 legal fee<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> and the medical expenses; however, he 
 admitted that he did not keep financial records at the time and was unable to 
 locate his client file regarding the settlement.</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<h3>Wilson Matter</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">In 1996, Saleem Wilson retained respondent to represent him 
 in a property damage matter against his insurance carrier. Without Mr. Wilson’s 
 knowledge or consent, respondent settled the property damage claim for 
 $15,879.44. Respondent forged his client’s name on the settlement draft and 
 converted the funds. </p>
<p class="bodycopy">When respondent refused to respond to his client’s requests 
 for information regarding the status of his claim, Mr. Wilson retained counsel, 
 Wayne James, who had employed respondent as a law clerk prior to respondent’s 
 bar admission, to seek recovery of the settlement proceeds. Respondent failed 
 to honor the formal demands for payment. Therefore, Mr. Wilson and Mr. James 
 filed a report with the New Orleans Police Department, which resulted in 
 respondent’s arrest. Following respondent’s criminal conviction stemming from 
 the theft of funds, respondent provided $15,000 in restitution to Mr. Wilson.</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<p class="bodycopy">Mr. Wilson filed a complaint and supporting documentation 
 with the ODC. In the course of the ODC’s investigation, respondent gave a sworn 
 statement in which he indicated that he failed to disburse the funds to Mr. 
 Wilson because there was a dispute concerning the amount of the legal fees. 
 Respondent maintained he did not know how to place the disputed funds in the 
 registry of the court. He further testified that following his arrest, he 
 closed all of his bank accounts and placed the funds in a safe in his home. He 
 admitted he borrowed against the funds for personal and office expenditures.
</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<h3>Wright Matter</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">On October 7, 1998, Louis C. Wright paid respondent an 
 initial retainer fee of $350 to institute bankruptcy proceedings on his behalf. 
 Over the course of the next six months, respondent failed to file the 
 appropriate schedules, resulting in the dismissal of the bankruptcy case. On 
 April 14, 1999, Mr. Wright sent correspondence to respondent, advising that 
 respondent’s mishandling and neglect of the legal matter delayed his attempts 
 to correct his credit problems and also hampered efforts to amicably resolve 
 the matter with his mortgage company, likely resulting in the loss of his home. 
 Respondent failed to respond to his client’s request for the refund of the fee.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Mr. Wright filed a complaint and supporting documentation 
 with the ODC. During the ODC’s investigation of the complaint, respondent gave 
 a sworn statement alleging his delay in filing the appropriate schedules 
 stemmed from his client’s failure to give him the necessary information.</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<h3>Lavelis Fountain Matter</h3>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<p class="bodycopy">On November 17, 1998, Lavelis Fountain retained respondent 
 to represent him in a personal injury matter on a contingency fee basis. 
 Respondent failed to take any action in the matter on behalf of his client. 
 Moreover, he neglected to communicate with Mr. Fountain after January 1999.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Mr. Fountain filed a complaint and supporting documentation 
 with the ODC. Respondent failed to respond to the ODC’s requests for 
 information.</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<h3>Williams Matter</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">In 1998, Rodney Williams retained respondent to represent 
 him in a personal injury matter and a discrimination matter. Without the 
 knowledge or consent of Mr. Williams, respondent settled the personal injury 
 matter for $3,660. Respondent forged Mr. Williams’ signature on the settlement 
 draft and converted the funds. In subsequent conversations with his client, 
 respondent neglected to advise he had settled the case and received the funds. 
 As to the discrimination proceeding, respondent failed to diligently pursue the 
 case on behalf of Mr. Williams, and refused to respond to his client’s requests 
 for information.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Mr. Williams filed a complaint and supporting documentation 
 with the ODC advising of respondent’s misconduct. In a sworn statement, 
 respondent claimed that according to the employment contract, he did not need 
 his client’s permission to settle the personal injury case and cash the 
 settlement draft. Contrary to Mr. Williams’ testimony at the formal hearing, 
 respondent also testified his client was not entitled to any funds from the 
 personal injury case since the employment contract specified the settlement 
 funds would go toward his expenses in the discrimination suit. The ODC 
 requested that respondent provide a copy of the employment contract, as well as 
 an accounting; however, respondent failed to comply with the request. </p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<h3>Ruth Fountain Matter</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">In 1998, Ruth Fountain retained respondent to institute suit 
 against an automobile dealer stemming from her purchase of an allegedly 
 defective vehicle. While respondent filed suit on behalf of his client, he 
 failed to take any further action in the matter. Ms. Fountain made numerous 
 efforts to contact respondent regarding the status of her case, but was unable 
 to contact him. </p>
<p class="bodycopy">On June 25, 1999, Ms. Fountain filed a complaint with the 
 ODC. In a deposition taken during the ODC’s investigation, respondent admitted 
 Ms. Fountain’s case had “slipped through the cracks,” and that he failed to 
 advise his client he had taken no action in the matter. Respondent contended 
 that he was unable to produce her file because he had misplaced it during one 
 of his office relocations. </p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<h3>Landry Matter</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">In 1997, Rosalind Christina Landry retained respondent to 
 represent her in a medical malpractice suit. After instituting suit, respondent 
 neglected to reply to discovery requests, resulting in the dismissal of one of 
 the defendants. </p>
<p class="bodycopy">On July 6, 1999, Ms. Landry filed a complaint with the ODC. 
 Respondent provided an initial sworn statement in the matter, but provided no 
 further information.</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<h3>Vance Matter </h3>
<p class="bodycopy">In September 1997, Alice Gail McBride Vance retained 
 respondent to represent her in a personal injury matter. Although respondent 
 took some initial action, he later abandoned Ms. Vance’s case and failed to 
 respond to her requests for information regarding the legal matter and her 
 files in his possession.</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<p class="bodycopy">On July 12, 1999, Ms. Vance filed a complaint and supporting 
 documentation with the ODC. In a sworn statement, respondent denied that he 
 neglected his client’s matter and failed to communicate with her. Contrary to 
 Ms. Vance’s testimony at the formal hearing, respondent contended his 
 employment was terminated by Ms. Vance prior to completion of her case. 
 However, he conceded he never received anything in writing from her advising of 
 such and that he never formally withdrew from her case. He maintained the delay 
 in resolving her case stemmed from a court clerical error in obtaining a 
 default judgment in his client’s favor. Moreover, respondent stated that he 
 advised Ms. Vance she could pick up her file at any time after she terminated 
 his services.</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<h3>Lancelin Matter</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">In May 1998, Trent M. Lancelin retained respondent to 
 represent him in property damage and personal injury matters stemming from a 
 vehicular accident. Over the course of the next year, Mr. Lancelin spoke to 
 respondent on three occasions, and was led to believe respondent was pursuing 
 the case. However, without Mr. Lancelin’s knowledge or consent, respondent had 
 settled the property damage and personal injury claims for $665 and $7,800, 
 respectively, shortly after he was retained. Respondent had endorsed his 
 client’s signature on the settlement drafts and converted the funds to his own 
 use. </p>
<p class="bodycopy">On September 15, 1999, Mr. Lancelin filed a complaint with 
 the ODC advising respondent would not respond to his requests for information 
 regarding the status of his case. At the time, Mr. Lancelin was still unaware 
 respondent had settled his case. </p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<p class="bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed formal charges alleging 
 respondent’s actions violated the following provisions of the Rules of 
 Professional Conduct: Rules <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.1 --#">
 1.1</a></span> (neglect of a legal matter), <span class="Rules">
 <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.2 --#">1.2</a></span> (failure to abide by scope of 
 representation), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.3 --#">1.3</a></span> 
 (incompetence), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.4 --#">1.4</a></span> 
 (failure to communicate), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.5 --#">

 <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.15 --#">1.15</a></span> (commingling and conversion of 
 client funds), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.16 --#">1.16</a></span> 
 (failure to protect client interests upon termination of representation),
 <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.1 --#">8.1</a></span> (knowingly

 for information from disciplinary authorities and failure to cooperate in

 <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a></span> (violating or attempting to 
 violate the professional rules, commission of a criminal act adversely 
 reflecting on a lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer and 
 engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or misrepresentation).
</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Respondent filed an answer to the formal charges. In his 
 answer, he denied any misconduct.</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-126.HC --#">Recommendation of the Hearing Committee</a></h3>
<p class="bodycopy">Respondent failed to appear at the formal hearing. The ODC 
 presented the testimony of seventeen witnesses in support of its case.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing committee 
 determined the ODC proved the allegations of professional misconduct by clear 
 and convincing evidence. The hearing committee found respondent knowingly and 
 willfully violated duties to his clients, the judicial system and the 
 profession, resulting in serious actual harm. It determined his clients’ legal 
 matters were delayed, and in some instances dismissed, because of his failure 
 to act. Moreover, the committee pointed out his clients were denied their 
 funds.</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<p class="bodycopy">Relying on the ABA’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer 
 Sanctions, the committee concluded the baseline sanction for respondent’s 
 misconduct is disbarment. As aggravating factors, the committee recognized 
 dishonest or selfish motive, pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, refusal 
 to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the misconduct, and failure to cooperate 
 and obstruction of the disciplinary process. The committee did not cite any 
 mitigating factors. Accordingly, the committee recommended respondent be 
 disbarred.</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-126.BD --#">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board
</a></h3>
<p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board adopted the factual findings of the 
 hearing committee. The board found respondent knowingly, if not intentionally, 
 violated duties owed to his client, the public and the profession. It noted 
 there was actual injury to respondent’s clients because he deprived them of 
 their settlement funds, failed to refund unearned fees, failed to pay third 
 parties and delayed the administration of his clients’ cases. Additionally, 
 many clients had to engage new counsel at additional expense to have their 
 legal problems resolved. The board found such conduct damages the public’s view 
 of the reputation and integrity of the legal profession.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">In addition to the aggravating factors cited by the 
 committee, the board recognized the vulnerability of respondent’s victims as an 
 aggravating factor since most of the clients appeared to be legally 
 unsophisticated and have meager resources. Further, although the board 
 recognized respondent’s inexperience in the practice of law as a mitigating 
 factor,<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> it concluded his knowing and/or 
 intentional actions, the pattern of misconduct and the numerous offenses 
 suggest his inexperience in the practice of law had little or nothing to do 
 with his misconduct. The board recommended respondent be disbarred from the 
 practice of law and ordered to pay full restitution to his victims.</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<p class="bodycopy">Although neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the 
 disciplinary board’s recommendation, this court, on its own motion, ordered 
 briefing pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(G)(1)(a). The court’s 
 September 18, 2002 order directed the parties “to address whether the sanction 
 of permanent disbarment pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, Sections 10(a) and 
 24, as amended August 1, 2001, is appropriate under the facts of this case.”</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original 
 jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V, § 5(B). Consequently, we act as 
 triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine 
 whether the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing 
 evidence. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94),
 <a href="#!-- #ID:646%20So.2d%20343 --#">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 348</span>;

 <a href="#!-- #ID:597%20So.2d%20444 --#">597 So. 2d 444</a>, 445 (La. 1992)</span>. 
 While we are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the 
 hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error 
 standard is applicable to the committee’s factual findings. See
 <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Caulfield</i>, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96),
 <a href="#!-- #ID:683%20So.2d%20714 --#">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>;
 <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94),
 <a href="#!-- #ID:633%20So.2d%20150 --#">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>. </p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<p class="bodycopy">The record supports a finding of serious professional 
 misconduct. Respondent’s repeated practice of settling client matters on his 
 own volition, forging settlement checks and converting the resulting funds for 
 his own use displays a shocking disregard for his professional obligations. 
 There are no mitigating factors present;<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> 
 however, numerous aggravating factors exist. Under these circumstances, we 
 conclude the baseline sanction is disbarment. However, given the egregiousness 
 of respondent’s misconduct, we will further consider whether permanent 
 disbarment is warranted.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">On August 1, 2001, after a lengthy period of study and 
 public comment, this court adopted amendments to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10<a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> 
 and § 24<a class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a> to provide for the sanction of 
 permanent disbarment. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Gros</i>, 98-0772 (La. 
 3/15/02), <a href="#!-- #ID:815%20So.2d%20799 --#">815 So. 2d 799</a>;</span>
 <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Parker,</i> 00-3532 (La. 3/15/02),
 <a href="#!-- #ID:815%20So.2d%20794 --#">815 So. 2d 794</a>;</span>
 <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Patrick</i>, 01-1419 (La. 3/15/02),
 <a href="#!-- #ID:815%20So.2d%20804 --#">815 So. 2d 804</a>.</span> In our 
 commentary accompanying the amendment, we stated, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="bodycopy">In the public interest, the Court has amended Louisiana 
 Supreme Court Rule XIX to codify Permanent Disbarment as an available sanction 
 for attorney misconduct. While the Court has always had the discretion to deny 
 an application for readmission after the requisite five (5)-year waiting period 
 after disbarment, an attorney who is permanently disbarred under these 
 circumstances will be prohibited from applying for readmission to the bar. 
 These amendments reflect the judgment of the Court that in some instances 
 lawyer misconduct may be so egregious as to warrant a sanction of permanent 
 disbarment based on the facts of an individual case and in consideration of the 
 guidelines in Appendix E to the Rules of Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement. </p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<p class="bodycopy">In Appendix E, we set forth several guidelines illustrating 
 the type of cases which might warrant permanent disbarment. We explained that 
 these guidelines were not intended to bind this court in its decisionmaking, 
 but to provide “useful information to the public and to lawyers concerning the 
 types of conduct the Court might consider to be worthy of permanent 
 disbarment.” Under Guideline 1, “repeated or multiple instances of intentional 
 conversion of client funds with substantial harm” are a ground for permanent 
 disbarment. Clearly, respondent’s conduct in the matters at issue falls 
 squarely within this guideline. </p>
<p class="bodycopy">As recently noted in <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Morphis</i>, 
 01-2803 (La. 12/4/02), <a href="2001-2803">___ So. 2d ___</a></span>, we do not 
 lightly impose the sanction of permanent disbarment. Nonetheless, we are firmly 
 convinced that we would be remiss in our constitutional duty to regulate the 
 practice of law if we did not impose that sanction here. Respondent has utterly 
 failed in his ethical obligation to preserve and maintain his client’s funds. 
 As did the respondent in Morphis, respondent has used his law license not to 
 foster the high standards of the profession, but as a license to steal from the 
 citizens of Louisiana. This court cannot and will not tolerate such conduct by 
 an attorney, upon whom high standards of honesty and righteousness are erected. 
 See <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Haylon</i>, 250 La. 651,
 <a href="#!-- #ID:198%20So.2d%20391 --#">198 So. 2d 391</a>, 392 (1967)</span>. 
 Because respondent does not possess the requisite moral fitness to practice law 
 in this state, he must be permanently disbarred.</p>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="bodycopy"></p>
<p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the 
 hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is 
 ordered that the name of Blair David Condoll be stricken from the roll of 
 attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be 
 revoked. Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered 
 that respondent be permanently prohibited from being readmitted to the practice 
 of law in this state. Respondent is ordered to make full restitution to his 
 victims. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent 
 in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to 
 commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s judgment until 
 paid.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">&nbsp;</p>
<hr noshade color="#000000" align="left" width="100">
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">&nbsp;1</a> Respondent was originally charged 
 with a total of fourteen counts of misconduct. The disciplinary board dismissed 
 five counts of the formal charges (counts IX, X, XI, XIII and XIV) based on a 
 finding respondent was not properly served. The ODC did not file an objection 
 in this court to the board’s dismissal of these counts. Accordingly, we will 
 not discuss them further.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> Respondent provided an accounting 
 alleging he expended 27 hours on behalf of his clients at $150 per hour, 
 totaling $4,050. However, the allocation of time appears to be suspect. For 
 example, respondent billed his clients three hours to request a police report 
 and draft a one-page letter of representation. He billed two hours for 
 reviewing a two-page police report and making a phone call to Ms. Gray. He 
 billed five hours for preparing a letter of representation and arranging for 
 his clients to receive treatment with one medical clinic. </p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> Respondent was admitted to the 
 practice of law in 1997. Each of the numerous complaints and the formal charges 
 were filed within approximately two years of respondent’s bar admission.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> The board identified respondent’s 
 lack of experience as a mitigating factor, but recognized that his misconduct 
 resulted from intentional misconduct, not inexperience. Like the board, we give 
 little, if any, weight to respondent’s inexperience.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">5 </a>Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10(A) was 
 amended to add the highlighted language:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="footnotetext">(1) Disbarment by the court. <em>In any order or 
   judgment of the court in which a lawyer is disbarred, the court retains the 
   discretion to permanently disbar the lawyer and permanently prohibit any such 
   lawyer from being readmitted to the practice of law.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn6">6</a> Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A) was 
 amended to add the highlighted language:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="footnotetext">A disbarred lawyer or a suspended lawyer who has 
   served a suspension period of more than one year, exclusive of any waivers or 
   periods of deferral, shall be reinstated or readmitted only upon order of the 
   court. . . . No lawyer may petition for readmission until five years after 
   the effective date of disbarment. A lawyer who has been placed on interim 
   suspension and is then disbarred for the same misconduct that was the ground 
   for the interim suspension may petition for readmission at the expiration of 
   five years from the time of the effective date of the interim suspension. <em>
   The court retains the discretion, in accordance with Section 10A of this 
   rule, to permanently disbar a lawyer and permanently prohibit any such lawyer 
   from being readmitted to the practice of law.</em></p>
