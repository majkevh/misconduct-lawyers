<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 03-B-1354</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: JACQUELINE PHILLIPS</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

<p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">This proceeding arises from a petition for consent discipline filed by respondent, Jacqueline Phillips, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana, but currently on interim suspension. For her misconduct in various pending disciplinary matters, respondent 
proposed that she be disbarred. The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) concurred in the petition, and the disciplinary board recommended the proposed discipline be accepted.</p>

<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">In July 1999, the ODC filed seventeen counts of formal charges against respondent arising out of twelve complaints of ethical misconduct. The formal charges generally alleged that respondent neglected legal matters, failed to communicate with her clients, failed to account for 
and return unearned legal fees, failed to properly safeguard client property, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation. Following a formal hearing in that proceeding (numbered 99-DB-062), the hearing committee recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for 
three years.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">While the matter was pending in the disciplinary board, respondent and the ODC filed in this court a joint motion for interim suspension stemming from the charges subject of the <a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-062.BD --#">99-DB-062</a> matter, as well as two additional sets of formal 
charges that had been filed against respondent in August 2000 (00-DB-107) and April 2001 (01-DB-043).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title id="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> We granted the motion on October 24, 2001. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Phillips</i>, 01-2678 (La. 10/24/01), 799 So. 2d 1134</span>.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">One week later, on November 2, 2001, the disciplinary board filed its report in 99-DB-062, recommending that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for three years, with all but one year deferred, followed by a two-year period of supervised probation. The ODC filed an 
objection in this court to the leniency of the sanction recommended by the board, and the matter was set on the court's April 2002 docket for oral argument pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 11(G)(1)(b). However, prior to hearing argument, we remanded the matter to the disciplinary board for 
consolidation with the other pending disciplinary matters involving respondent. The board was instructed to issue &quot;a single recommendation to this Court&quot; encompassing all such matters. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Phillips</i>, 01-2948 (La. 3/27/02)</span>.</p>

<h2 >DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

<h3 >Petition for Consent Discipline</h3>

<p class="Bodycopy">Following remand, respondent filed a petition for consent discipline. The petition addressed all three sets of formal charges filed by the ODC, as well as the allegations of misconduct in four of the ODC's open investigatory files. For her misconduct, respondent proposed that she 
be disbarred from the practice of law. The ODC concurred in the petition.</p>

<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-107.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>

<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board found that respondent's misconduct was negligent in part, knowing in part, and intentional in part, and that she breached duties owed to her clients, the legal system, the public, and the profession. As a result of respondent's misconduct, her clients' 
legal matters have been delayed and jeopardized. The profession has also been harmed by respondent's failure to cooperate. An attorney's failure to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation unjustly delays and imposes an additional burden upon the disciplinary system. Additionally, respondent's 
failure to safeguard third-party funds and to return unearned fees to her clients has resulted in the actual loss of money to her clients and to a third-party medical provider.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Based upon its review of the record, the board determined the following aggravating factors are present: pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, and substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted 1986). The board found the following mitigating factors are present: 
absence of a prior disciplinary record and personal or emotional problems.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title id="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class="Bodycopy">After considering the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> and the prior jurisprudence of this court dealing with misconduct similar to respondent's, the board concluded that disbarment is the appropriate sanction in this case. Accordingly, the board recommended 
the petition for consent discipline be accepted.</p>

<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">Although this matter arises from a petition for consent discipline, Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 20(B) provides that the extent of discipline to be imposed is subject to review. In determining an appropriate sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to 
maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>, 513 So. 2d 1173 (La. 1987). The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses 
involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:459 So.2d 520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent has admitted to numerous instances of serious professional misconduct, including neglect of legal matters, failure to communicate with clients, failure to account for or return unearned legal fees, and failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation. This 
alarming pattern of misconduct - which appears to have occurred over a period of at least six years - clearly caused actual harm to respondent's clients, the public, the legal system, and the profession. While some mitigating factors may be present, their weight is clearly insufficient to warrant 
the imposition of a sanction less than disbarment.</p>

<p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the petition for consent discipline and order that respondent be disbarred from the practice of law.</p>

<h2>DECREE</h2>

<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the record filed herein, it is ordered that the name of Jacqueline Phillips, Louisiana Bar Roll number 17347, be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that her license to practice law in 
the State of Louisiana be revoked. Respondent is ordered to make restitution to her former clients and to third parties. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, &sect; 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date 
of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><sup><a name="_ftn1" href="#_ftnref1" id="_ftn1">[1]</a></sup> All three sets of formal charges involve substantially similar allegations of misconduct. The proceeding numbered <a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-107.BD --#">00-DB-107</a> encompasses five counts of formal charges, and
<a href="#!-- #ID:01-DB-043.DB --#">01-DB-043</a> encompasses two counts of formal charges. Furthermore, the ODC was still investigating complaints against respondent, and had open investigative files numbered 13129, 13335, 13392, and 14662.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><sup><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" id="_ftn2">[2]</a></sup> The board noted the conduct at issue in these matters arose after respondent entered private practice as a solo practitioner. Shortly thereafter, respondent became pregnant and attempted to balance the demands 
associated with maintaining her private practice and fulfilling her obligations as a single parent.</p>
