  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 00-DB-128</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <h3>PER CURIAM</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a joint petition for consent discipline,
  after the institution of formal charges, by Dwayne Williams ("Respondent") of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, an attorney
  licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana, and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC"). For reasons
  stated below, the Disciplinary Board accepts the petition and orders a public reprimand be issued against
  Respondent.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On October 12, 2000, ODC filed formal charges, consisting of three counts, against Respondent.
  Despite being personally served with the formal charges on November 21, 2000, Respondent failed to file an answer to
  the charges. On December 18, 2000, ODC filed a motion to have the factual allegations contained in the formal charges
  deemed admitted. On January 10, 2001, the chair of Hearing Committee Number 25 granted ODC's motion. By the same
  order, the parties were given until February 20, 2001 to file written arguments and documentary evidence on the issue
  of sanctions.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On February 20, 2001, ODC and Respondent filed a joint petition for consent discipline,
  stipulation of facts, and memorandum in support of the proposed sanction of a public reprimand. On April 26, 2001, a
  panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter. Deputy Disciplinary Counsel James T. Daly represented ODC.
  Respondent did not appear.</p>

  <h3>STIPULATED FACTS</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The stipulation of facts filed in this matter provides as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"During the course of the investigations of investigative matter Nos. 0008606 and 0008695, the Respondent was
    not cooperative in providing information necessitating the issuance of two subpoenas in order to obtain information
    from him.</p>

    <p>"Also, in investigative matter No. 0010547, the Respondent had employed a suspended attorney in his law office.
    That suspended attorney was sending correspondence, without supervision by the Respondent, which gave the
    impression that the suspended attorney was holding himself out as an attorney. No clients were harmed by these
    actions by Respondent."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In the petition, Respondent admits to violating Rules 8.1(c) and 8.4(g) (failure to cooperate in
  a disciplinary investigation) as well as Rule 5.3(b) (failure to properly supervise a non-lawyer employee) of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct. The parties propose that a formal public reprimand be issued to Respondent and that
  Respondent be required to attend the Ethics School offered by the Practice Assistance Counsel of the Louisiana State
  Bar Association.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rules <span class="Rules">5.3</span>,
  <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  The
  Board must accept that Respondent has violated these rules.  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La.
  6/7/96); <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given the violations of these rules, the
  Board is left to determine if the proposed sanction is appropriate.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system,
  or to the profession;</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based upon a review of the record, the Board finds that by failing to supervise his non-lawyer
  employee Respondent has negligently violated duties owed to his clients. Additionally, the Board finds that by
  failing to cooperate in the disciplinary investigation of complaints filed against him Respondent has knowingly and
  intentionally violated duties owed to the profession.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The parties contend that Respondent's misconduct in this matter caused no harm to Respondent's
  clients. There is nothing in the record to dispute this contention. However, Respondent's failure to cooperate has
  resulted in actual injury to the legal profession. An attorney's failure to cooperate unduly delays and burdens the
  disciplinary process.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Finally, in the petition, the parties assert that the mitigating factor of absence of a prior
  disciplinary record is present in this matter. The record contains nothing to support a finding that any other
  aggravating or mitigating factor is present.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> to
  determine the baseline sanction by determining "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's mental state and the extent
  of the injury caused; and then adjust[ing] the sanction in accordance with the aggravating and mitigating factors
  present."  <span class="CITE"><i>In re Quaid</i>, <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 350
  (La. 1994)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Given the facts of this case, the following ABA Standards are applicable. Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">7.3</span> provides for reprimand "when a lawyer negligently engages in conduct that is a
  violation of a duty owed as a professional, and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, or the
  legal system." Standard <span class="ABAstandard">7.2</span> provides for suspension "when a lawyer knowingly engages
  in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional, and causes injury or potential injury to a client,
  the public, or the legal system."</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Board also looks to relevant case law for assistance in determining an appropriate sanction
  for violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  In the matter of <span class="CITE"><i>In re Cline</i>, 99-2779
  (La. 2/29/00), <a href="../SC/2000-02-29_1999-2779.htm">756 So. 2d 284</a></span>, the Court imposed a suspension of
  six months, with three months deferred, followed by two years of supervised probation for an attorney's failure to
  properly supervise a non-lawyer employee. The Court noted that in matters involving little or no injury the baseline
  sanction for failure to properly supervise a non-lawyer is a public reprimand, but that Cline's previous disciplinary
  record justified an upward deviation. In the instant matter, Respondent does not have a prior disciplinary record;
  therefore, an upward deviation does not appear appropriate.  Moreover, at the oral argument in this matter, Deputy
  Disciplinary Counsel advised the Board that in only one instance did the suspended attorney who was working for him
  send the questionable correspondence.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Other relevant cases include: <span class="cite"><i>In re Browning</i>,
  <a href="1999-06-03_98-DB-070.htm">98-DB-070</a></span> (Board ordered public reprimand for attorney's failure to
  timely pay a third-party medical provider and for attorney's failure to cooperate in the disciplinary investigation);
  and <span class="CITE"><i>In re Harrington</i>, 92-2206 (La. 11/30/92), <a href="../SC/1992-11-30_1992-2206.htm">608
  So. 2d 631</a></span> (Court ordered public reprimand for attorney's failure to cooperate in disciplinary
  investigation of complaint filed against him).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ABA Standards suggest a public reprimand or suspension is appropriate for Respondent's
  misconduct in this matter. The case law suggests that, after consideration of the facts and circumstances present in
  this matter, public reprimand is appropriate for Respondent's misconduct. While the Board does not condone
  Respondent's failure to cooperate in the initial investigation, his agreement to enter into a consent discipline has
  lessened the delay caused by this initial failure and warrants consideration in the determination of the appropriate
  sanction in this matter.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the joint petition for consent discipline be accepted,
  and that a public reprimand be issued against the Respondent, Dwayne Williams. The Board also orders that Respondent
  attend the Ethics School offered by the Practice Assistance Counsel of the Louisiana State Bar Association. Finally,
  the Board orders that all costs and expenses of these proceedings be assessed to Respondent, with legal interest to
  commence running thirty days from the date of this Ruling until paid.</p>
