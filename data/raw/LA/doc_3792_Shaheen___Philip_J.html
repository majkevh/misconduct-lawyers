  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana State Bar Association, through its Committee on Professional Responsibility,
  instituted this disbarment proceeding against Phillip J. Shaheen, Jr.; the basis was Shaheen's conviction in federal
  court of mail fraud and conspiracy.  A hearing was held before John Dale Powers, appointed commissioner by this
  court.  The commissioner found that the conviction evidences both a lack of honesty and trustworthiness and
  represents a serious crime.  Disbarment was deemed an appropriate disciplinary action.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On December 18, 1970 a federal jury convicted Phillip J. Shaheen, Jr. of three counts of
  conspiracy and mail fraud, in violation of<b> </b> 18 U.S.C., ss 371 <a name="FNREF1" class="fn" href="#FN1"
  id="FNREF1">(FN1)</a> and 1341.  <a name="FNREF2" class="fn" href="#FN2" id="FNREF2">(FN2)</a> This conviction was
  affirmed by the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Sub nom.  United States v. Perez, 489 F.2d 51 (1973). 
  Rehearing and rehearing en banc were denied on January 2, 1974.  The United States Supreme Court denied Shaheen's
  application for a writ of certiorari on June 10, 1974.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This conviction grew out of a scheme, involving several lawyers and doctors, to defraud insurance
  companies by staging fake accidents, after which the allegedly injured participants in the accidents would retain
  lawyers to represent them in their claims.  Chief Judge John Brown of the Fifth Circuit described the scheme as
  follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>'The facts of this case, in a purely legalistic sense, need no embellishment in a literary sense to classify
    this as a piece of prose that could well be called a second 'American tragedy.'  It would be an American tragedy,
    not only because the events took place here, but because it is just another instance in which large numbers of
    Americans get willingly involved in enterprises which reflect a lack of compunction, possibly even a proclivity, to
    enter into the proverbial 'get-rich-quick scheme' evidencing not only a disregard for law but, sadly, also a
    deafness to conscience.  As we undertake our profound but prosaic role of adjudicating these cases, what we see is
    not pleasant.  It reveals a wreckage of promising professional careers, evidence of deliberate and unabashed
    attempts to prey upon financially pressed expectant mothers for gain and the seemingly all too eager participation
    by a large cast of characters in a patently illegal undertaking.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><b>The Scheme</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A recital of the facts must precede resolution of the issues raised on appeal.  The
  Louisiana-wide get-rich-quick scheme involved the staging of fraudulent automobile accidents for the purpose of
  creating false personal injury claims.  These claims would be submitted to the insurance carriers for the respective
  vehicles involved in the wrecks with the aid and contrivance of certain physicians and lawyears.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As the scheme evolved, the participants even coined their own terminology which, though alien to
  the unintiated, became known to all those who participated.  This glossary of modern day crookedness was quite
  descriptive.  Certain participants were known as 'recruiters'.  The recruiters function, not unnaturally, was to
  recruit others who assumed titles commensurate with their organizational function.  There were the 'hitters', whose
  function it was to drive the 'hitter' vehicle in each collision which supposedly was to be liable for causing the
  accident.  Then there was the 'target' vehicles.  The occupants of the 'garget' were known as<b>   </b>  the 'driver'
  and the 'riders'.  It was determined at the outset that pregnant women made exceptionally good riders as they could
  claim pregnancy related injuries which would be both hard to disprove and easily settleable with the insurance
  carriers.  Throughout the scheme there was an effort made on the part of the participants to use vehicles and drivers
  which were covered by high limits of liability insurance.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">According to a pre-arranged timetable, the 'hitter' vehicle would strike the 'target' vehicle
  either broadside or in the rear end.  The occupants of the 'target' vehicle--the driver and riders--and occasionally
  some of those in the 'hitter' vehicle, feigning injuries, would be sent to a particular doctor and lawyer who would
  facilitate phony claims by creating a medical history for treatment of non-existent injuries and making a demand on
  the appropriate insurance company.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The key to immediate financial gain in each staged collision was advances paid by the attorneys
  to the 'riders' for whom allegedly false claims were being submitted.  These advances were paid in the form either of
  cash payments or loans from local financial institutions, co-signed by the attorney handling the claim.  Of the usual
  advance ranging from $250 to $500, part was retained by the rider-claimant with the rest being distributed among the
  organizers, recruiters, and others who assisted with various aspects of staging the wreck.  When the claim was
  ultimately settled with the insurance carrier, the proceeds would be applied to (i) repay the advancing attorney or
  in such cases, to liquidate the guaranteed bank loan and (ii) to pay the inflated doctor's bill, not infrequently,
  with kickbacks going to both the organizers and the participating attorneys in addition to their usual shares. U.S.
  v. Perez, 489 F.2d 51, 54--55.  (Footnotes omitted).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Several objections to the commissioner's findings of fact and conclusions of law have been raised
  by respondent, who first contends that this proceeding is premature because his conviction is not yet final, there
  being an appeal presently pending in the Fifth Circuit from a ruling by a federal district judge that denied his
  motion for a new trial.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Article XV, s 8, paragraph 7 of the Articles of Incorporation of the Louisiana State Bar
  Association, under which this proceeding was brought, provides:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(7) After the conviction has become final, that is, all appeals have been concluded or
    exhausted, the procedure shall be as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p class="inverted">(a) The Committee will file a petition in the Supreme Court seeking disbarment or any other
      remedy that the Committee deems appropriate, and the petition will be served upon the respondent in the same
      manner as in ordinary proceedings.</p>

      <p class="inverted">(b) When issue is joined by answer by the respondent, a Commissioner will be appointed by the
      Supreme Court to represent the Court in the same manner as in ordinary proceedings.</p>

      <p class="inverted">(c) At the hearing before the Commissioner, the certificate of the conviction of the
      respondent shall be conclusive evidence of his guilt of the crime for which he has been convicted.</p>

      <p class="inverted">(d) At the hearing based upon a respondent's conviction of a crime, the sole issue to be
      determined shall be whether the crime warrants discipline, and if so, the extent thereof.  At the hearing the
      respondent may offer evidence only of mitigating circumstances not inconsistent with the essential elements of
      the crime for which he was convicted as determined by the statute defining the crime.'</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's conviction became final in June of 1974, twenty-five days after the United States
  Supreme Court denied his application for a writ of certiorari.  Rule 58 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the
  United States.  See <span class="CITE">Louisiana State Bar Association v. Ponder, 263 La. 743, <a 
  href="1972-11-06_52373.htm">269 So.2d 228</a> (1972)</span>.  The appeal on which respondent relies is a
  post-conviction application for a new trial, first filed in December of 1972 after the first appeal from the
  conviction was taken April 29, 1971.  The   possibility of post-conviction relief through applications for writs of
  habeas corpus or motions for new trials does not affect the finality of the conviction.  Louisiana State Bar
  Association v. Ponder, supra.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Next, respondent contends that Article XV, s 8, paragraph 7(c), relating to the certificate of
  conviction being conclusive evidence of guilt, is not applicable because his conviction on December 18, 1970 occurred
  before the effective date of this article, September 1, 1971.  This argument has no merit.  The conviction became
  final in June of 1974, twenty-five days after the United States Supreme Court denied writs.  Article XV, s 8,
  paragraph 7 was effective when the conviction became final and is applicable to this proceeding.  Louisiana State Bar
  Association v. Ponder, supra.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Finally, respondent contends that the commissioner erred in refusing to consider the testimony
  offered by the respondent, through various witnesses, affidavits and transcripts, tending to negate his guilt of the
  crime charged.  Specifically, respondent attempted to show through various witnesses that he had no knowledge of the
  fact that the accidents were staged.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The commissioner's ruling is correct.  Paragraph 7(c) and (d) of Article XV, s 8 provides:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">'(c) At the hearing before the Commissioner, the certificate of the conviction of the
    respondent shall be conclusive evidence of his guilt of the crime for which he has been convicted.</p>

    <p class="inverted">(d) At the hearing based upon a respondent's conviction of a crime, the sole issue to be
    determined shall be whether the crime warrants discipline, and if so, the extent thereof.  At the hearing the
    respondent may offer evidence only of mitigating circumstances not inconsistent with the essential elements of the
    crime for which he was convicted as determined by the statute defining the crime.'</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accepting respondent's position would require the committee to try the respondent anew for the
  crime of which he clearly stands convicted.  This is unrealistic and not contemplated by the articles of
  incorporation.  Rather, under 7(c), supra, the certificate of conviction 'shall be conclusive evidence of his guilt
  of the crime.'</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent, at the hearing, may introduce 'evidence only of mitigating circumstances not
  inconsistent with the essential elements of the crime for which he was convicted.'  An essential element of the crime
  for which respondent was convicted is knowledge. 18 U.S.C. s 371.  <span class="CITE">United States v. Johnson,  504
  F.2d 622 (7th Cir.1974)</span>; <span class="CITE">United States v. Roselli, 432 F.2d 879 (9th Cir. 1970).</span> 
  Thus, evidence that respondent had no knowledge of the fact that the accidents were staged is inconsistent with an
  essential element of the crime for which he was convicted, and hence inadmissible at the hearing.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mitigating circumstances' are such as do not constitute a justification or excuse of the offense
  in question, but which, in fairness and mercy, may be considered as extenuating or reducing the degree of moral
  culpability.  See <span class="CITE">In re Greiner, 61 Wash.2d 306, 378 P.2d 456 (1963</span>).  Respondent argues
  that the testimony of these witnesses is relevant, even if he cannot be heard to contest his guilt of the crime, to
  show that his participation in the scheme was somehow lesser than others, i.e., he was on the periphery of the
  scheme, not in the center.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">We believe, however, that such evidence is not evidence of 'mitigating circumstances not
  inconsistent with the essential elements of the crime.'  Rather, such evidence goes to the guilt or innocence of the
  respondent.  The committee is not a jury.  The jury at his trial found sufficient evidence to prove him guilty beyond
  a reasonable doubt of mail fraud and conspiracy.  The jury determined that Shaheen was not so far toward the
  periphery of the scheme that he was guiltless, but that he was so directly involved that he was guilty beyond a
  reasonable doubt.  The committee can hear evidence in mitigation, extenuating circumstances which tend to diminish
  the need for punishment, but it need not hear evidence tending to show only that respondent   did not commit the act
  for which he was convicted.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As to the merits, we agree with the commissioner's finding that the offenses for which Shaheen
  stands convicted are serious enough to warrant discipline.  The remaining issue is the extent of discipline.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The crimes involved in this case strike at the very heart of our legal profession.  Respondent
  stands convicted by a jury of participating in a scheme to defraud insurance companies by the staging of fake
  accidents, resulting in fake injuries, for which damages were sought and received from unwitting insurers. 
  Respondent Shaheen's part in this episode is summed up by Chief Judge Brown:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>'The convicted professionals, five lawyers and two physicians in number, are unanimous in their contention that
    they were misled by both their clients, or patients as the case was, and the DeMary brothers as to the fraudulent
    character of the collisions.  They contend that the testimony relied on to establish their knowing complicity was
    self-serving, uncorroborated and unreliable.  Appellants point to certain testimony by the government's key
    witnesses which was controverted by others of the government's witnesses and argue tenaciously that these
    inconsistencies undermine from the validity of the verdict.</p>

    <p>We find these contentions without merit.  Not only do we refuse to invade the province of the jury, except where
    the most compelling absence of evidence so dictates, here we perceive much more than the slight evidence required. 
    Tomplain v. United States, (5 Cir., 1930, 42 F.2d 202) supra.  Other than the testimony of Kenneth and Larry DeMary
    and others similarly situated, which is assailed on common grounds (see, notes 41 and 42, supra), the showing on
    the crucial question of knowledge on the part of the convicted professionals was entirely circumstantial. 
    Nonetheless, it was substantial.  Repeatedly, the lawyers dealt, not with their clients, but directly with the
    DeMary brothers and their appointees.  Money exchanged hands, employment contracts were signed, and promissory
    notes were executed without the lawyers ever having laid eyes on the second party to the transaction. . . .</p>

    <p>. . . Appellant Shaheen, Hennigan's law partner in Lake Charles, was initially charged in counts I through VI
    and XIII of the indictment.  (See App.  I: (4); App.  II: (3)).  Counts V, VI, and XIII against him were ultimately
    sent to the jury for which convictions were returned.  Evidence adduced by the government established Shaheen's
    participation in at least one other staged collision, in addition to the June 1, 1966 and July 14, 1966 (App.  I:
    (11), (13); App.  II: (6)(8)) accidents, which formed the basis for counts V and VI of the indictment respectively,
    and the January 5, 1966 accident, evidence of which was stricken by the trial court.  He was also charged with two
    overt acts, reference to one of which was stricken with the January 5, 1966 accident, the remaining two arising out
    of the July 14, 1966 staged collisions in Sulfur.  (See App.  I: (13); App.  II: (8)).  Again, we conclude that
    sufficient evidence was adduced to support the jury's finding that appellants Hennigan and Shaheen were apprised of
    the fraudulent nature of the collisions and knowingly entered into the overall agreement.  There was direct
    testimony adduced that appellant Hennigan and Shaheen represented claimants in staged collisions without ever
    conferring with or even seeing the clients from beginning to end.  Again, as with Tunis and Loridans the signing of
    employment contracts, execution of promissory notes, and exchange of money occurred between the appellant attorneys
    and one of the DeMary brothers.  There is direct testimony that both of these appellant attorneys were fully aware
    of the fraudulent nature of the collisions.  Testimony established that subsequent to the February 17, 1966
    collision in Monroe, Louisiana (App.  I: (6); App.  III: (2)) one of the claimants represented<b> </b>   by
    Hennigan was unavailable to endorse the settlement check and sign the release.  To solve this problem Kenneth
    DeMary, in Hennigan's presence, signed the claimant's name to the check and release after which Hennigan notarized
    the release, certifying that the claimant had personally appeared before him.  There was testimony also that
    appellant attorney Shaheen customarily demanded and received 'kick-backs' in addition to his regular fee for those
    staged collisions in which he represented claimants.  Following the June 1, 1966 collision, one of the claimants
    testified that upon receiving from Shaheen an advance on the anticipated settlement, the bulk of the advance was
    turned over to appellant Prudhomme for transmission to the DeMarys.  There is direct testimony that Shaheen had
    counseled the DeMary brothers on the type of injuries the claimants should complain of and stated that whiplash
    injuries could not be detected by means of x-rays.  It was testified that he further suggested that pregnant women
    be used as riders where possible, so they could claim various pregnancy related injuries incurred in the
    collisions.</p>

    <p>Further testimony from two witnesses indicated that upon learning that appellant DeVille had absconded with the
    money advanced to the claimants after the July 14, 1966 accident (App.  I: (13); App.  II: (8)), both Shaheen and
    Hennigan were fearful that DeVille would ultimately inform on them to the authorities.' 489 F.2d 51, 72-75.

  punishment of the attorney as it is for the preservation of the integrity of the courts and the salutary effect it

    <p class="Bodycopy">I fully agree that disciplinary action must be taken against the respondent.  I will even
    concede that perhaps he should be disbarred.  However, I cannot approve the result of this proceeding, because in
    my opinion it was achieved without affording the respondent due process of law.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">As the majority opinion correctly reflects, disciplinary proceedings were commenced against
    respondent because of his conviction in federal court of mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud.  The
    principle crime is defined by 18 U.S.C. s 1341, as follows:</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">'Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for
    obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, or to sell,
    dispose of, loan, exchange, alter, give away, distribute, supply, or furnish or procure for unlawful use any
    counterfeit or spurious coin, obligation, security, or other article, or anything represented to be or intimated or

    directed to be delivered by the person to whom it is addressed, any such matter or thing, shall be fined not more
    than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.'</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">In essence, the crime could involve a swindle of anything from a few cents to millions of
    dollars through use of the mails.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">The main thrust of Shaheen's defense was that his degree of culpability was not sufficient to
    warrant disbarment, because he was only peripherally involved in a scheme perpetrated by others.  The respondent
    attempted to prove this by offering testimony, affidavits and transcripts.  But this evidence was given little, if
    any, regard by the Commissioner because he concluded that 'the question of the degree of knowledge on the part of
    (Shaheen) is not properly at issue' and that no evidence which tended to disprove Shaheen's guilt of any aspect of
    the crimes of which he was convicted could be considered.  The Commissioner stated that his decision in this regard
    was dictated by Article XV, s 8(7)(d) of the Louisiana State Bar Association Articles of Incorporation, which
    provides:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>'(7) After the conviction has become final, that is, all appeals have been concluded or exhausted, the
      procedure shall be as follows:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>'(d) At the hearing based upon a respondent's conviction of a crime, the sole issue to be determined shall
        be whether the crime warrants discipline, and if so, the extent thereof.  At the hearing the respondent may
        offer evidence only of mitigating circumstances not inconsistent with the essential elements of the crime for
        which he was convicted as determined by the statute defining the crime.'</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="Bodycopy">The majority opinion, as I understand it, has adopted the Commissioner's interpretation of the
    article.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">I do not agree with this interpretation.  Standing alone the last quoted sentence, of course,
    can be given such a construction.  However, it would be at odds then with the preceding sentence, which sets forth
    the principal duty of this Court in this kind of disciplinary proceeding, and that is to determine 'whether the
    crime warrants discipline, and if so, the extent thereof.'  Instead, I would construe the entire section to allow
    the respondent to introduce evidence,<b> </b>   not to totally disprove his guilt, but in order to show that the
    degree of his culpability is not as great as that which might be inferred from the face of the judgment of
    conviction against him.  It is conceivable that the circumstances under which an attorney has participated in the
    wrongful conduct of a client might be such that moral turpitude would be slight and yet the attorney might be
    guilty in fact and in law of a crime.  Such a situation might justify less drastic action than permanent disbarment
    of the attorney.  See, <span class="cite">In re Tinkoff, 101 F.2d 341 (7th Cir. 1939)</span>.  or
    <span class="cite">La.  State Bar Association v. Ponder, <a  href="1976-10-12_54456.htm">340 So.2d
    134</a> (La.1976)</span>.  (After considering evidence in mitigation of Guilt the Court suspended an attorney for
    six months following his conviction of making false income tax returns).  If we do not recognize this possibility
    and allow the consideration of evidence tending to prove it, I simply do not see how we can intelligently determine
    the extent to which an attorney's crime warrants discipline.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">On the other hand, if the article of incorporation cannot be construed as suggested, I would
    have no recourse but to find the sentence barring introduction of evidence mitigating the degree of guilt
    unconstitutional as denying due process under both the federal and state constitutions.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p class="Bodycopy">In reaching the decision to disbar Phillip Shaheen the Commissioner and this Court did not
    follow the requirements of the article of incorporation, as correctly interpreted, and certainly did not heed the
    precepts of our constitutional law.  Insofar as I have determined, neither this Court nor the Commissioner has
    reviewed the record of the federal trial which led to the respondent's convictions, although this evidence was
    available to both.  This record undoubtedly contains evidence relevant to the degree of his culpability in the form
    of testimony in his favor as well as cross-examination of the witnesses against him.  Instead of reviewing this
    evidence, the Commissioner and the Court merely accepted as proven those facts stated in the Fifth Circuit Court of
    Appeals opinion.  With all due respect to<b> </b> the able author of that opinion, there are several reasons it
    should not be used as a basis for our judgment of the extent of discipline warranted in this case.  The author was
    not authorized by our constitution or laws to act as a finder of fact in Louisiana attorney disciplinary
    proceedings.  His function in preparing the opinion was not that of a trier of fact, but that of a federal
    appellate judge assembling the evidence which would reasonably support the jury's verdict.  In doing so, it may
    have been unavoidable for him to emphasize some of the most damning evidence against the respondent while properly
    considering it unnecessary to recite any mitigating evidence in his favor.  An independent review of the record of
    respondent's trial by the Commissioner and this Court would have required some additional effort but not a retrial
    of the case as suggested by the Commissioner's report and the majority opinion.  It seems that in order to afford a
    fair hearing or its equivalent this is the least that should have been done before stripping respondent of his
    right to practice law and thereby grievously injuring him, his wife, his five children, and his dependent mother. 
    In concentrating their attention on the federal court of appeals opinion, and in refusing to consider the evidence
    offered by respondent to show that his involvement in the unlawful scheme was limited, the Commissioner and this
    Court have deprived respondent of liberty and property without due process of law and may have committed a grave
    injustice.</p>
