  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 04-B-3044</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: KEITH D. JONES</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that
  respondent violated Rule <span class="Rules">5.1(c)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct by failing to ensure
  that his law partner complied with his professional obligations under Rule <span class="Rules">1.8(a)</span>. Prior
  to the filing of formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent discipline. Having
  reviewed the petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Keith D. Jones,
  Louisiana Bar Roll number 7494, be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of ninety days. It is
  further ordered that this suspension shall be fully deferred, subject to respondent's successful completion of a
  two-year period of probation governed by the conditions set forth in the petition for consent discipline. Any failure
  by respondent to comply with these conditions or additional misconduct by respondent during the probationary period
  may be grounds for making the deferred suspension executory or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
