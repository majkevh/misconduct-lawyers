  <p class="bodycopy"> Disciplinary Proceedings were instituted through the filing of two separate sets of formal
  charges by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel on March 15, 1994 and August 1, 1994 against the Respondent Jerome
  Dixon of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy"> Dixon is accused in No. 94-DB-009 of failing to represent a client competently, failing to ;act
  with diligence or communicate with his client, an inmate, and engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration
  of justice which resulted in a dismissal on August 29, 1991, on the client's case with prejudice due to the
  plaintiff-clients's failure to prosecute <a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a> In No. 94-DB-024,
  Dixon is charged with failing to respond to Disciplinary Counsel's investigative subpoena with which he was
  personally served on December 7, 1993.  He is charged with disobeying an obligation under the rules of a tribunal,
  failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation, and engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of
  justice <a class="fn" href="#fn2" name="fnref2" id="fnref2">2</a></p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy"> On August 27, 1991, James O'Banion, Jr., an inmate at Angola filed a complaint against Dixon
  asserting various deficiencies with Dixon's representation.  Dixon provided a written response to the complaint on
  December 1, 1 991.  For the next two years, the matter remained under investigation by the Office of Disciplinary
  Counsel.  On September 9, 1993, a hearing committee chairman approved the filing of formal charges against Dixon
  arising out of his representation of Mr. O'Banion.  Six months later on March 1 5, 1 994, formal charges were filed
  with the Board.  Dixon answered the formal charges and asserted that Mr. O'Banion failed to prevail in his case due
  to Mr. O'Banion's acceptance and then rejection of a settlement offer.  Dixon asserted that the client's rejection
  occurred five days before the scheduled trial date, thus leaving Dixon with no time to have O'Banion Transported from
  prison to federal court in New Orleans for trial.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy"> A hearing was scheduled for July 5, 1994 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, before
  <span class="CITE"><a href="../HC/1995-01-20_94-DB-009.htm">Hearing Committee#1</a></span> composed of Amy Counce,
  Chairman, Leuanne Greco, Lawyer Member and Father Jeffrey Bayhi, public member.  Dixon arrived at the hearing with
  counsel who requested a continuance in order to prepare a defense.  The request was granted and the hearing
  rescheduled for September 7, 1994.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy"> In the meantime on August 1, 1994, Deputy Disciplinary Counsel Bernadine Johnson filed separate
  charges (approved by a Hearing Committee Chairman on March 22, 1994) against Dixon in Matter No. 94-DB-024
  <span class="bodycopy">for his failure to appear pursuant to an investigatory subpoena personally served on Dixon
  commanding his appearance on January 5, 1, 1394.  The issuance of a subpoena was necessitated by a complaint filed by
  Dorothy Davies on June 29, 1 993, to which Dixon failed to respond.  Dixon answered the second set of formal charges
  by relating that he did not recall receiving Disciplinary Counsel's subpoena.  He contended that he gave Ms. Davis
  her f ile sometime in November or December and assumed the matter was concluded.</span></p>

  <p class="bodycopy"> A hearing in the matter generated by Mr. O'Banion's complaint took place in Baton Rouge on
  September 7, 1994.  Dixon was represented by George Downing.  The Hearing Committee filed its report on January 20,
  1995 recommending that Dixon be publicly reprimanded -for his misconduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy"> A hearing on the failure to cooperate charge proceeded forward in Baton Rouge on November 15,
  1994 before <span class="CITE"><a href="../HC/1995-01-03_94-DB-024.htm">Hearing Committee #14</a></span> comprised of
  Donald Zuber, Chairman; Jarnes Boren, Lawyer Member; and Major Reginald Brown, Public Member.  Dixon was represented
  by Harley Brown.  Hearing Committee #14 filed a report on January 3, 1 995 recommending that Dixon be publicly
  reprimanded for his failure to honor Disciplinary Counsel's subpoena.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy"> The matter was administratively consolidated once the recommendations of the two separate
  hearing committees were received by the Board.  Oral Argument was presented on March 31, 1995 to Panel C of
  Disciplinary Board comprised of Orlando N. Hamilton, Jr., Chairman; Homer Ed Barousse, Jr., Lawyer Member; and Sibal
  S. Holt, Public Member.  Deputy Disciplinary Counsels Bernadine Johnson and Fred Ours and Dixon's attorneys Harley
  Brown, Henrietta Bridges and George Downing presented argument to the panel.</p>

  <h2>REPRESENTATION OF MR.  O'BANION, 94-DB-0009</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Hearing Committee made the following findings of fact, which we adopt:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p> [T] he complainant herein, James Henry O'Banion, Jr. filed a civil lawsuit in May of 1988 in the United States
    District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against the Sheriff of St. Bernard parish and certain of his
    employees, alleging that he received personal injuries when another inmate at the St. Bernard Parish Prison set
    fire to his bed sheets, resulting in him being burned <a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a>
    Said lawsuit was initially filed with Mr. O'Banion representing himself in proper person as an inmate incarcerated
    in the St. Bernard Parish Prison.  Thereafter, Respondent Jerome W. Dixon was retained by Mr. O'Banion to represent
    him in these proceedings, and formally enrolled as his attorney of record on or about April 5, 1989.  Following an
    evidentiary hearing held before Magistrate Louis Moore, Jr. on November 17, 1989, this matter was placed on the
    trial docket of Judge Morey L. Sear, U.S. District Judge.</p>

    <p> An initial trial was scheduled in this matter before Judge Sear for November 19, 1990, which was continued to
    March 25, 1991 by the Court, and thereafter again continued without date.  On April 16, 1991, a telephone
    scheduling conference was held with the U.S. District Court, and a trial date was scheduled for August 26, 1991 at
    8:30 AM The same scheduling order set a final pretrial conference for August 13, 1991.</p>

    <p> The Respondent undertook a vigorous representation of his client in this litigation, and ... the trial court
    encouraged settlement of the matter at the various conferences held with the Court. Following the April 1 6th
    scheduling conference, ... the defendants in the litigation, through their legal representative, conveyed a
    settlement offer to the Respondent for the total sum of $2,500.00. We are further persuaded by the evidence that
    the Respondent relayed this offer to his client shortly after receiving it.</p>

    <p>At this point in the chronology of events, the evidence is not as clear.  We do know, however, that the
    Respondent notified the defendant attorneys a few days before the scheduled trial date of August 26, 1991 that his
    client had rejected the settlement offer.  Furthermore, on August 26, 1 99 1, Judge Sear called the case for trial,
    and Respondent 'was not present on behalf of Mr. O'Banion.  Thereafter, after instruction by the Court, the
    defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiff's case, with prejudice, for the plaintiff's failure to prosecute.  A
    Judgment was signed in that respect by the Court on or about August 26, 1991.</p>

    <p> Respondent asserts that this client accepted the settlement offer, and changed his mind at the last minute,
    resulting in their inability to proceed with the trial as ,scheduled.  Mr. O'Banion, however, asserts that he
    <u>never</u> accepted the $2,500 settlement offer, and that he consistently urged and re-urged the Respondent to
    proceed to -trial, in the hopes of obtaining a much higher dollar figure in Satisfaction of his alleged injuries. 
    Taken alone, the testimony of the Respondent and Mr. O'Banion seems to constitute a "'swearing match.' However, in
    considering the testimony given at the hearing by the defense attorneys in the litigation (Mary Hand and Sal
    Gutierrez), we are persuaded that Mr. O'Banion did not accept the settlement offer (even though it was apparently
    recommended by the Respondent), and that -the Respondent <u>never</u> conveyed his client's acceptance of the
    ,settlement to his opposing counsel.  Apparently what happened was that the Respondent felt strongly that his
    client ,should accept the offer, that he told him so repeatedly, and -that he presumed that his client would accept
    his offer prior to the trial date.  Unfortunately, that did not occur.</p>

    <p>Once the Respondent was faced with his client's adamant refusal to accept the settlement offer on the eve of
    -trial, the Respondent was left with no alternative but to appear for trial unprepared (without sufficient time to
    compel the attendance of witnesses, even his own client).  We accept Respondent's explanation for his failure to
    appear on the morning of trial as due to traffic problems, since he apparently contacted the Court and opposing
    counsel later that morning and notified them of his tardiness. At that point, however, it did not matter whether
    the Respondent appeared or not, as he would have been unable to proceed with his case in any event with no
    witnesses.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Hearing Committee concluded that Dixon violated Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1(a),
  acknowledging that while Dixon did possess the legal knowledge and skill to present Mr. O'Banion's claim in Court,
  his lack of thoroughness and preparation in readying for the August 26, 1991 trial date fell short of the Committee's
  perception of competent representation." The Committee also found a violation of Rule 1.3 in that Dixon failed to act
  with reasonable diligence and promptness in attempting to present the evidence to the Court at the trial on the
  merits.  If, as Dixon testified, his client had <em>accepted</em> the Settlement offer, that information should have
  been conveyed to defense counsel for the purpose of obtaining the settlement funds and executing the settlement
  documents well before the scheduled trial date.  In light of the findings that Dixon's client did <u>not</u> accept
  the settlement, Dixon was still capable of diligently preparing his case for trial, and seeing to it that his
  witnesses and client would appear on the appropriate date.  The Hearing Committee concluded that his failure to do so
  constitutes violations of Rules 1.1 and 1.3, and with them, Rule 8.4 (a).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> The Hearing Committee found no violation of Rule 1.3 (communication with clients) or that Dixon
  failed to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter.  Given the client's almost
  <em>immediate</em> notification to the Bar Association of Dixon's alleged conduct (his complaint is dated August 27,
  1991, the day after the scheduled August 26, 1 991 trial,) -the Committee found no violation of this rule.  The
  Committee found that Dixon communicated the settlement offer and discussions to his client; unfortunately, they were
  unable <b>to</b> have a 'meeting of the minds' in order to successfully complete the settlements.</p>

  <h2>FAILURE TO COOPERATE, NO. 94-DB-024</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Hearing Committee # 1 4 made the following pertinent findings of fact which we adopt as our
  own:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p> The hearing commenced at approximately 10: 1 5 AM <b>on</b> November 1 5th, although the hearing had been
    noticed for 9:00 of that date.  Mr. Dixon appeared late and offered as an excuse that there had been an attempted
    burglary at his home the evening before.  The testimony before the Board consisted of testimony of Ms. Marilyn O.
    Jones, an employee of the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office and the testimony of Mr. Dixon.  The documentary
    evidence introduced was a note of evidence showing the non-appearance of Mr. Dixon at the Office of the
    Disciplinary Counsel on January 5, 1994, as ordered by a subpoena and a copy of the subpoena showing personal
    service on Mr. Dixon on December <b>7,</b> 1993.  The subpoena appears to be in order, executed by the Chairman of
    the Hearing Committee No. 1 1 and Bernadine Johnson at the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.  It is noted that the
    subpoena states that questions concerning the subpoena may addressed to Ms. Johnson and gives her phone number at
    the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.</p>

    <p> Ms. Jones testified that she was employed in a clerical position at the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's
    office and <b>only</b> serves subpoenas in her office when a person being subpoenaed comes to the office to accept
    service.  She Could <b>not</b> remember serving Mr. Dixon, but her records indicated that Mr. Dixon came to the
    office and personally received the subpoena.  Mr. Dixon did not contradict this testimony and admitted being served
    with the subpoena as testified to by Ms. Jones.</p>

    <p> Mr. Dixon testified that he received a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel concerning the return of
    Ms. Davis' file.  He testified that he had responded to this letter however he had no copy of his response nor did
    the file of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel reveal any response to the initial complaint.  Mr. Dixon testified
    that some time in August of 1993 he returned Ms. Davis' file to her.  The Committee notes that this is inconsistent
    with his answer.  When he received the subpoena Mr. Dixon called the Office of Disciplinary Counsel to advise them
    that he no longer had the file of Ms. Davis, that it had been returned to her and he did not know how to
    respond to the subpoena.  Mr. Dixon had no documentation of this call nor did he follow up on this call with a
    letter.  The records of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel indicate that Mr. Dixon did contact the Office of
    Disciplinary Counsel on January 6, 1 994, one day after the return date on the subpoena saying that he had
    forgotten about the deposition.  There is no record of any prior communication with the Office of the Disciplinary
    Counsel.  Mr. Dixon testified that he spoke to a man at the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, however it is noted
    that the subpoena told him to contact Ms. Bernadine Johnson.</p>

    <p>Mr. Dixon did not retain any correspondence concerning the complaint nor documentation concerning the return of
    the file to Ms. Davis.  The Committee specifically notes that Mr. Dixon did not make the effort to respond in
    writing to the subpoena nor indicate to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel that the subject matter of the subpoena
    had been satisfied.  Mr. Dixon apparently takes a cavalier attitude towards responding to requests or to
    subpoenas.  His practices indicate if not a willful refusal to comply with the rules of the Disciplinary Counsel, at
    least, a casual indifference to or negligence in the obligations attendant to the practice of law.  The Committee
    does not find that Mr. Dixon's refusal to honor the subpoena was a willful or deliberate act to circumvent the
    efforts of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel or to hide, conceal or misrepresent evidence in this matter.</p>

    <p> The Committee's impression of Mr. Dixon is that he is a very sloppy attorney who does not take his
    responsibilities to his clients or to the Bar very seriously.  Mr. Dixon was late for the Committee Hearing, which
    certainly should have been very important to him.  The Committee, however, feels that he was not late in a
    contemptuous manner, but for some reason he cannot or does not pay appropriate attention to the serious matters
    which the normal attorney would deem to be very important.  How this reflects on his private practice of law is
    unknown, but, certainly he does not take his professional responsibility seriously enough.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Hearing Committee found Dixon guilty of failure to honor the subpoena issued by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel.  The Hearing Committee found both aggravating and mitigating factors, and made a specific
  finding that the file had in fact been returned to the client.  Dixon failed to advise the Office of Disciplinary
  Counsel in writing to this effect.</p>

  <h2>SANCTION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> The detailed and well-reasoned findings of the two Hearing Committees are not in dispute and the
  Board concurs in the findings.  Having found misconduct and violations of Rules of Professional Conduct
  <span class="Rules">1.1</span>, <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span>,
  <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> as well as
  <span class="Rules">Rule 19, Section 9(c)</span>, we must consider, as did the Hearing Committees, the factors set
  forth in Rule 19, Section 10 C. We find that Dixon has violated a duty owed to the client (in the matter relating to
  his representation of James O'Banion) and to the legal system, particularly the Rules of Professional Conduct and
  Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement as set forth by the Supreme Court.  In both instances, he acted
  negligently.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> Hearing Committee #1 found that in the case of Mr. O'Banion, the injury to the client was no
  greater than $2,500.  Hearing Committee #1 did not recommend a requirement that Dixon be required to furnish
  restitution to O'Banion, in light of the testimony of defense counsel regarding the 'no liability nuisance' valuation
  and recommendation to settle Mr. O'Banion's claim.  As to the failure to cooperate, Hearing Committee #14 noted the
  obstruction, unnecessary cost and delay of proceedings involved ii the complaint of Ms. Davis caused by Dixon's
  failure to respond to the subpoena.  Dixon's disregard for the subpoena and the authority that issued it has caused
  this agency to expend its resources, particularly the time and talents of the eighteen volunteer members who serve in
  an adjudicatory capacity in review of this matter. <a name="fnref4" class="fn" href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4'</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The following ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions 9.22 aggravating factors are present:
  (b) <span class="ABAstandard">selfish motive as regards his failure to cooperate</span>; (c)
  <span class="ABAstandard">a pattern of misconduct</span><a name="fnref5" class="fn" href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a> (d)
  <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>; (g) <span class="ABAstandard">refusal to acknowledge the wrongful
  nature of the conduct</span>; and in <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the victim</span>, Mr. O'Banion.  The
  mitigating factors include: (a) <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>; (b)
  <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a selfish motive</span> in regard to the representation of Mr. O'Banion; (f)
  <span class="ABAstandard">inexperience in the practice of law</span> when Dixon represented Mr. O'Banion, Dixon
  having been admitted to practice for only 3 years at the time the case was dismissed; and (j)
  <span class="ABAstandard">delay in disciplinary proceedings</span>.<a name="fnref6" class="fn" href="#fn6"
  id="fnref6">6</a> It should be noted that any delays regarding the filing of formal charges against Dixon for his
  failure to cooperate could have been averted if Dixon had complied with the subpoena served upon him on December 7, 1
  993 or provided a written response to the complaint, which he did not do until April 3, 1995, almost 2 years after
  the complaint was filed with this office and after the disciplinary hearing, said response consisting of Dixon's
  affidavit, presented by his attorneys during oral argument before the panel.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> ABA Standard <span class="ABAstandard">6.23</span> provides that a reprimand is generally
  appropriate when a lawyer negligently fails to comply with a court order or rule, and causes injury or potential
  injury to a client or other party, or causes interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding.  ABA
  Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span> provides that a reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is
  negligent and does not act with reasonable diligence in representing a client, and causes injury or potential injury
  to a client.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> Due to the presence of several mitigating factors, particularly the fact that Dixon has no prior
  disciplinary record as well as the length of time between the acts complained herein and resolution of the matter,
  the Disciplinary Board finds that a public reprimand coupled with several conditions to be the appropriate
  discipline.  It is hoped that with the "wake up call' of two disciplinary proceedings that Dixon will henceforth
  adhere to the Rules of Professional Conduct and conduct himself accordingly.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> The Disciplinary Board issues the following order:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT JEROME W. DIXON be publicly reprimanded for the misconduct set forth
  above;</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Jerome W. Dixon earn an extra 15 CLE credits in the area of law
  office management for solo practitioners, such credits to be above and beyond the mandatory 15 hours required each
  year for members of the Bar.  The credits shall be completed within 6 months of the finality of this decision, and
  proof of compliance shall be filed in the record of these proceedings by Dixon and/or his attorneys.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Jerome W. Dixon pay all costs associated with these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> Dixon is encouraged to avail himself of the services offered by the Solo Practitioner's Section
  of the Louisiana State Bar Association.</p>

  <div id="dissentUhl">
    <p>I respectfully dissent from the majority.</p>

    <p>To me its impossible to escape the facts in this case that the Respondent failed to honor a subpoena in
    94-DB-024 and later lied when asked if he received the subpoena.  The record and testimony show that Respondent
    picked up the subpoena!</p>

    <p>He also lied when he notified the Disciplinary Board that he "gave Ms Davis her file some time in November or
    December and I assumed that matter was concluded at that point".  Even the committee noted that is answers are

    <p>Mr. Dixon has not retained any correspondence concerning the complaint nor documentation concerning the return

    misrepresent evidence in this matter". "The Committee's impression of Mr. Dixon is that he is a very sloppy
    attorney who does not take his responsibilities to his clients or to the Bar very seriously".  The report goes on,
    "Mr.  Dixon was late for the Committee Hearing, which certainly should have been very important to him.  The
    Committee, however, feels that he was not late in a contemptuous manner, but <em>for some reason he cannot or does
    notpay apropriate attention to the selfous matters which the normal attorney would</em> <em>deem very
    important".</em></p>

    <p>And the committee report asks a closing question, "How this reflects on his private practice of law is
    unknown(?), but, certainly he does not take his professional responsibilities seriously enough".</p>

    <p>Findings of Facts by the Hearing Committee in 94-DB-009 the Respondent "his lack of thoroughness and preparation
    in readying for the August 26, 1991 trial date falls short of our perception of <b><u>"competent</u></b>
    <b><u>representation."</u></b> Furthermore, we find that Respondent failed to act with <b><u>'reasonable diligence
    and</u></b> <b><u>promptness"</u></b> in attempting to present the evidence to the Court at the trial on the
    merits.</p>

    <p>In 94-DB-024 &amp; 94-DB-009.</p>

    <p>Mitigating factors included the fact that there were no prior disciplinary record.  And the length of the time
    of the onset of the complaints and the resolution of the matter(s).</p>

    <h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINE..</h2>

    <p>In matter of prior discipline, I understand how this subject might not get much import or attention when taken
    up as if it were one (1) complaint.  It is a consolidation of two (2) complaints- of types and charges.  However,
    when confronted with the entire record, one cannot dismiss the two (2) separate complaints as one (1) complaint One
    complaint follows the other.  A string of rules violations that were interrupted, by these two complaints.  The
    consolidation is acknowledgement of the rules violation(s) in two separate instances.</p>

    <p>It may been prior discipline, nevertheless, Respondent has had problems with the disciplinary system</p>

    <p>on two (2) occasions Both cases show a pattern of misconduct.</p>

    <h2>LENGTH OF TIME FOR THE RESOLUTION OF BOTH CASES.</h2>

    <p>The facts indicate the Respondent had a major part in the delays, and obstruction of the proceedings involved in
    the resolution of both complaints!</p>

    <p>The facts indicate that it should be an aggravating factor, not a mitigating one.</p>

    <h2>REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WRONGFUL NATURE OF THE CONDUCT.</h2>

    <p>The facts in the record reflect that he has not acknowledged the wrongful nature of the conduct.  And is an
    aggravating factor</p>

    <h2>THE RESPONSIBILITY LAWYERS OWE TO THE COURT, PROFESSION &amp; PUBLIC.</h2>

    <p>In both cases Finding of facts and Conclusions of Law do not address the responsibilities Lawyers owe to the
    Courts, the Profession and to the Public.</p>

    <p>What message are we sending to the Profession and the Public, when failure to honor a subpena is given a public
    reprimand?</p>

    <p>What about the profession, is it better off now that lies are given a reprimand?  And is it better off for
    failure to respond to a subpoena receives public reprimand?</p>

    <p>A to the LAW, when the Respondent, based on the facts, lied when he made statements and gave evidence?  And, the
    sanction is a reprimand!  How outrageous!</p>

    <p>As a citizen member of the Board I am saddened to see subpoena treated as it was in this case.</p>

    <h2>  RECOMMENDED SANCTIONS</h2>

    <p class="Bodycopy">After reading the record my recommendations are:</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy"> 90 Day, suspension for the failure to respond to the subpena and the lying of respondent as to
    facts and statements.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy"> After the suspension term, a one (1) year probation.  I apply this probation period as a
    result of the -two (2) formal charges and the pattern of misconduct.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">He  extra 6 CLE credits, in the area of law office management for solo practitioners.  And such
    credits to be above and beyond the mandatory 15 hours required.  The credits completed within six (6) months.</p>
