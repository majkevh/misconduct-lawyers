<p class="bodycopy">This attorney

of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Woodrow W. Wyatt, an 
attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana, but currently ineligible to 
practice.<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a>
</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<h3>The Coleman Matter</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">Caretha Coleman 
filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. In December 1999, the ODC 
forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail at his primary 
registration address. After three notifications, the correspondence was returned 
marked “undeliverable as addressed.” The ODC thereafter served respondent with 
an investigatory subpoena compelling him to appear on February 16, 2000 and 
answer the complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear.</p>
<h3>The Springfield Matter</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">In early 1998, 
Sylvia Springfield retained respondent to handle a workers’ compensation claim. 
Respondent initially performed some work in the matter, but thereafter Ms. 
Springfield was unable to communicate with him. She terminated respondent’s 
representation and demanded the return of her file, but respondent failed to 
comply with this request. Ms. Springfield then retained new counsel in the 
workers’ compensation matter, who requested respondent transfer the file to him. 
Respondent also failed to comply with this request. </p>
<p class="bodycopy">A copy of Ms. 
Springfield’s July 1999 complaint to the ODC was forwarded to respondent by 
certified mail at his primary registration address. After three notifications, 
the correspondence was returned marked “unclaimed.” Thereafter, respondent could 
not be located for service of an investigatory subpoena. </p>
<p class="bodycopy">On October 10, 
2000, after formal charges were filed against respondent, Ms. Springfield 
advised the ODC that respondent had returned her file in the workers’ 
compensation matter.</p>
<h3>The Bergeron Matter</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">In January 1993, 
Ruby Bergeron retained respondent to handle a personal injury claim arising out 
of an automobile accident. Respondent timely filed a petition for damages, along 
with interrogatories and a request for production of documents, in October 1993. 
Thereafter, respondent did little or no work in the matter, with the exception 
of filing a motion to compel the defendant’s response to discovery, and he 
failed to communicate with his client. Ms. Bergeron terminated respondent’s 
representation by letter dated August 7, 1998. Nevertheless, respondent 
continued to advocate his rights as “an interested party.” He opposed a motion 
by defendant to dismiss the suit as abandoned and appeared at an August 18, 1998 
hearing on the motion on behalf of Ms. Bergeron. Respondent also attempted to 
interfere with the handling of the matter by Ms. Bergeron’s new attorney.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">A copy of Ms. 
Bergeron’s complaint to the ODC was forwarded to respondent by certified mail at 
his primary registration address in August 1999. Respondent failed to timely 
answer the complaint, and he could not be located for service of an 
investigatory subpoena. Respondent finally answered the complaint in writing in 
February 2000.</p>
<h3>The Bass Matter</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">Doris Bass filed a 
complaint against respondent with the ODC. In August 1999, the ODC forwarded a 
copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail at his primary 
registration address. Respondent failed to timely answer the complaint, and he 
could not be located for service of an investigatory subpoena. Respondent 
finally answered the complaint in writing in February 2000.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3 align="center"><i>Formal Charges</i></h3>
<p class="bodycopy">After 
investigation, the ODC filed four counts of formal charges against respondent, 
alleging that his conduct violated the following provisions of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct: Rules <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.3 --#">1.3</a> (failure to act 
with diligence in representing a client), <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.4 --#">1.4</a> 
(failure to communicate with a client), <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.7 --#">1.7</a>(b) 
(conflict of interest), <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.16 --#">1.16</a> (termination of 
the representation), <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE3.4 --#">3.4</a>(c) (knowing 
disobedience of an obligation under the rules of a tribunal),
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.1 --#">8.1</a>(c) (failure to cooperate with the ODC in 
its investigation), <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(a)</span> (violation of the 
Rules of Professional Conduct), <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(d)</span> 
(engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), and
<span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in 
its investigation). </p>
<p class="bodycopy">Respondent failed 
to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges. Accordingly, no formal 
hearing was held, and the matter was submitted to the hearing committee solely 
on documentary evidence. See <span class="AllRules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s11E --#">11</a>(E)(3)</span>. The ODC’s submission consisted of (1) 
the complaints filed by Ms. Coleman, Ms. Springfield, Ms. Bergeron, and Ms. 
Bass; (2) respondent’s written answers to the Bergeron and Bass complaints; (3) 
an August 12, 1999 sworn statement given by respondent addressing the 
Springfield, Bergeron, and Bass complaints; (4) respondent’s correspondence in 
the Bergeron matter; (5) requests for the files in the Springfield and Bergeron 
matters; (6) copies of the ODC’s letters transmitting the complaints to 
respondent by certified mail; (7) copies of the various subpoenas issued to 
respondent (some served, some not); and (8) information relating to respondent’s 
absence from his office due to health problems. Respondent filed nothing for the 
hearing committee’s consideration.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-127.HC --#">Hearing Committee 
Recommendation </a></h3>
<p class="bodycopy">The hearing 
committee found the ODC proved by clear and convincing evidence that respondent 
violated the professional rules as charged. In particular, the committee noted 
that respondent failed to cooperate in the investigations of each of the four 
matters at issue, failed to communicate with his clients, failed to release Ms. 
Springfield’s file to her new attorney when requested to do so, and interfered 
with the relationship between Ms. Bergeron and her new attorney. The committee 
determined respondent’s conduct was knowing and intentional and violated duties 
owed to his clients, the public, the legal system, and the legal profession. The 
committee found that this conduct may have led to actual or potential injury to 
respondent’s clients. </p>
<p class="bodycopy">In mitigation, the 
committee noted respondent was suffering from severe health problems during the 
period of time at issue, which it felt may have contributed to some degree to 
respondent’s “apparent lack of enthusiasm for his clients’ welfare.” In 
aggravation, the committee recognized respondent’s prior disciplinary record<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> 
and his substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted 1975). In light 
of these considerations, the committee recommended that respondent be suspended 
from the practice of law for eighteen months. </p>
<p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent 
nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee’s recommendation.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-127.DB --#">Disciplinary Board 
Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="bodycopy">After reviewing 
the record of this matter, the disciplinary board found that respondent 
neglected legal matters, failed to communicate with his clients, failed to 
protect his clients’ interests, failed to expedite litigation, failed to 
properly withdraw from representing his clients, failed to return his clients’ 
files upon request, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation. 
The board found respondent knowingly and, at times, intentionally violated 
duties owed to his clients, the legal system, and the profession. The board 
concluded respondent’s clients were injured by the delays in resolving their 
legal matters and in having to obtain new counsel, and that the legal system was 
injured by the use of limited resources in a fruitless effort to afford 
respondent the opportunity to participate in the disciplinary proceedings. 
Respondent breached his duties to the legal system by failing to abide by the 
agreement he made during his sworn statement to communicate with the 
complainants, resolve their questions, and complete the representations. 
Considering all of these factors, and the ABA’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer 
Sanctions, the board concluded the baseline sanction for respondent’s misconduct 
is a suspension from the practice of law.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">In mitigation, the 
board noted that respondent underwent open-heart surgery during the time that 
most of these complaints arose. With respect to aggravating factors, the board 
recognized respondent’s prior disciplinary record for similar misconduct, 
pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, failure to cooperate, and substantial 
experience in the practice of law. Taking these circumstances into account, the 
board suggested that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for 
eighteen months. The board also recommended that respondent be assessed with all 
costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running 
thirty days from the date of finality of the court’s judgment until paid.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Neither respondent 
nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board’s recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">The record 
supports the findings of the hearing committee and disciplinary board that 
respondent neglected client matters, failed to communicate with his clients, 
failed to properly withdraw from the representation of his clients, and failed 
to return his clients’ files upon request. Likewise, the record demonstrates 
conclusively that respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in its 
investigation of each of the four matters at issue. Therefore, the sole issue 
presented for our consideration is the appropriate sanction for respondent’s 
misconduct.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">In determining an 
appropriate sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed 
to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the 
integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar 
Ass’n v. Reis</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> 
(La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and 
the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating 
and mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">In cases involving 
neglect of legal matters combined with failure to cooperate, this court has 
generally imposed suspensions of one year and one day. See, e.g.,
<span class="CITE"> <i>In re: 
Turnage</i>, 01 1240 (La. 6/22/01), <a href="#!-- #ID:790%20So.2d%20620 --#">790 
So. 2d 620</a></span>, and cases cited therein. However, we note that in Turnage, the 
misconduct resulting in the suspension of one year and one day involved only two 
clients, rather than four, as here. In light of the numerous aggravating factors 
present in this case, in particular respondent’s prior disciplinary record 
involving precisely the type of misconduct at issue in this case, we see no 
justification for imposing a one year and one day suspension. Instead, we will 
adopt the recommendation of the disciplinary board that respondent be suspended 
from the practice of law for a period of eighteen months. </p>
<p align="center"><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p style="text-indent: 48; line-height: 200%">Upon review of the findings and 
recommendation of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering 
the record filed herein, it is the decision of this court that the 
recommendation of the disciplinary board be adopted. Respondent, Woodrow W. 
Wyatt, is hereby suspended from the practice of law for a period of eighteen 
months. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in 
accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence 
thirty days from the date of the finality of this court’s judgment until paid.
