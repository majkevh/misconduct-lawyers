  <p class="headingstyle">IN R E: MICHAEL A. FENASCI</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">RULING AND DECISION OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Disciplinary proceedings were instituted by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel against the
  Respondent, Michael A. Fenasci, of New Orleans, Louisiana on August 1, 1994 for his failure to cooperate with
  regard to the investigation of a complaint filed against him.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A complaint was filed with Disciplinary Counsel on October 13, 1993 by Camilla Boisseau. 
  Disciplinary Counsel requested a response from Fenasci to the complaint on November 2, 1993.  A second
  request, sent by certified mail was made to Fenasci on December 16, 1993.  He still did not respond.  On January 12,
  1994, Disciplinary Counsel moved for issuance of a subpoena, to compel Fenasci's attendance at deposition where he
  was directed to bring his file regarding representation of Ms. Boisseau.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The subpoena was approved by the chairman of a Hearing Committee on January 17, 1994, issued on
  January 28, 1994 and personally served upon Fenasci on February 9, 1994 commanding his personal appearance on March
  3, 1994.  Fenasci did not appear on this date but did deliver his file to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel on March
  7, 1994.  Formal Charges were approved by another Hearing Committee Chairman for failure to cooperate in the
  disciplinary investigation on July 14, 1994, said charges filed on August 1, 1994.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> The formal charges
  allege the following misconduct:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">You were retained to represent Camilla Boisseau, individually, and as the tutrix for Harry Lee
  Butler, relative to a claim involving the death of Simone Butler.  On February 9, 1994 you were personally served
  with a subpoena, issued pursuant to the authority of the Supreme Court of Louisiana, ordering you to appear before
  Disciplinary Counsel at 10:00 AM on March 3, 1994 to testify in the investigation of a complaint filed against you by
  Camilla Boisseau.  You failed, neglected, or refused to appear.  You have disobeyed an obligation under the rules of
  a tribunal, failed to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation, and engaged in conduct prejudicial to the
  administration if justice in violation of Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 9 (c), and Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">3.4(c)</span>, <span class="allegedrules">8.1(b)</span>(c), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span>(d)(g) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As noted above, Fenasci is charged with knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand from a
  disciplinary authority (<span class="allegedrules">Rule 19, Section 9
  C</span>); knowing disobedience of an obligation under the rules of a tribunal
  (<span class="AllRules">Rule</span> <span class="allegedrules">3.4c</span>) ; knowing failure to respond to a lawful
  demand for information from a disciplinary authority (<span class="allegedrules">8.1b</span>); knowing failure to
  respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority
  (<span class="allegedrules">8.1c</span>); violation of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct (<span class="allegedrules">8.4a</span>); engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the
  administration of justice, (<span class="allegedrules">8.4d</span>);
  and failure to cooperate with the Committee on Professional Responsibility (<span class="allegedrules">8.4g</span>).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Fenasci answered the complaint and asserted the following: He closed his file relating to Ms.
  Boisseau in the summer of 1991, whereupon the file was placed in storage.  He did not locate the file until March of
  1994 and after discovery, he immediately transmitted the file to Disciplinary Counsel.  Fenasci asserts that his
  failure to appear for deposition was an oversight as he was under the impression that only a copy of the file was
  sought by Disciplinary Counsel.  In order to correct this mistake, Fenasci wrote Disciplinary Counsel and related
  that he would make himself available, at their convenience in order to satisfy the subpoena and resolve this mater. 
  On May 24, 1994, Fenasci received a letter from Disciplinary Counsel stating that he would be notified if
  Disciplinary Counsel needed anything further.  His next contact with the office was receipt of the formal charges
  based on his lack of cooperation.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A <a href="../HC/1995-03-06_94-DB-023.htm">hearing was held in New Orleans on October 27, 1994
  before Hearing Committee #1 3</a> comprised of Arthur Kingsmill, Chairman; Timothy Mathison, Lawyer Member, and
  Patrick Sharp, Public Member.  Fenasci appeared in proper person and offered his testimony.  Deputy Disciplinary
  Counsel Bernadine Johnson submitted documentary evidence relating to Fenasci's failure to respond to the subpoena. 
  The Hearing Committee took the matter under advisement.  On March 3, 1995, the Hearing Committee rendered a report
  finding that no violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct were proven and therefore no sanctions should be
  imposed.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The matter was scheduled for oral argument before a panel of the Disciplinary Board comprised of
  Robert Kutcher, Lila Tritico Hogan, and John Uhl on April 20, 1995.  Fenasci did not appear nor did he submit a
  brief.  Deputy Disciplinary Counsel Bernadine Johnson filed a brief with the Disciplinary Board advocating a public
  reprimand and presented an argument to the panel.</p>

  <h2>FINDINGS OF THE HEARING COMMITTEE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Hearing Committee made the following factual findings in pertinent part as follows:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The evidence establishes that on February 9, 1994, Respondent was personally served with a
  subpoena commanding his appearance before Disciplinary Counsel on March 3, 1994.  The subpoena further commanded
  production of Respondent's entire file in the matter of Camilla Boisseau. <a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent testified that he was under the erroneous impression that the subpoena required only
  the production of the Boisseau file.  Respondent further testified that the file was in the hands of Ms. Kerry Kissel
  who was the liquidator of Respondent's former partnership.  The file was located in a storage warehouse and was
  copied and sent to Disciplinary Counsel on or about March 3, 1994.  The record reflects that the Disciplinary Counsel
  received the file on March 7, 1994.  It is conceded that Respondent did not appear as required by the subpoena.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">By letter dated March 31, 1994, Respondent apologized to Disciplinary Counsel for his
  nonappearance.  Respondent at that time made himself available to Disciplinary Counsel at Counsel's convenience.  The
  record reflects that, except for his failure to appear on March 3, 1994, Respondent has fully cooperated with
  Disciplinary Counsel and has expressed remorse for his inadvertence.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Hearing Committee found no violation of
  Rule 19, Section 9(c) (knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority) , Rules Of Professional Conduct
  <span class="Rules">3.4(c)</span> (knowing disobedience of an obligation under the
  rules of a tribunal) or <span class="Rules">8.1(b)</span> (knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand for
  information from a disciplinary authority) as all require knowing behavior and the Hearing Committee noted that
  Fenasci fully testified as to his mistake in reading the subpoena.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Likewise the Hearing Committee found no violation of Rules of Professional Conduct
  <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> or <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> as the
  alleged misconduct at issue is Fenasci's failure to personally appear before Disciplinary Counsel after being
  subpoenaed.  Since 8.1 (c) provides that a lawyer in connection with a disciplinary proceeding shall not fail to
  cooperate with the Committee on Professional Responsibility in its investigation of any matter before it, and as
  Fenasci has fully cooperated into the investigation of the circumstances behind his nonappearance, the Hearing
  Committee found no violation of <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> or <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span>.  Rule 8.4
  (g) establishes that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to fail to cooperate with the Committee on
  Professional Responsibility in its investigation of alleged misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Hearing Committee determined that Disciplinary Counsel did not prove any violation of
  Rule <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> ("It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to
  the administration of justice.') as the underlying disciplinary proceeding through which the subpoena was issued has
  been resolved.  The Hearing Committee commented further that :</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was not in possession of the file at the time it was subpoenaed.  Upon receipt of the
  subpoena, Respondent made all efforts to locate the file and have it copied.  Respondent did, in fact, produce the
  file albeit some three days late.  Given these circumstances, the Hearing Committee finds no violation of the Rules
  of Professional Conduct by Respondent.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The conclusions of the Hearing Committee based on the testimony and documentary evidence adduced
  at the hearing are clearly erroneous.</p>

  <h2>FINDINGS OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">It is clear from the face of the subpoena that a personal appearance is required.  The 10th line
  from the top of the document reads as follows <b>'YOU ARE HEREBY</b> <b>COMMANDED</b> to appear before Disciplinary
  Counsel at the place, date and time shown below to state under oath your knowledge of the facts
  relevant to the above matter." (Bolding supplied).  Six lines later the subpoena indicates that : <b>"YOU ARE</b>
  <b>ALSO COMMANDED to bring with you</b> the following documents) or object(s) ENTIRE FILE IN THE MATTER OF CAMILLA
  BOISSEAU." (Bolding supplied).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Even if Fenasci "just glanced at the subpoena' as he testified at the hearing, it is obvious that
  both his person and his papers are directed to appear.  Clearly an inmate object such as a file cannot state under
  oath its 'knowledge of the facts' relevant to his representation of Camilla Boisseau.  The Board is not persuaded
  with Fenasci's explanation, that he, an attorney with over 15 years experience is somehow so lacking in
  reading comprehension skills that he labored under the wrong impression that only his file materials were being
  requested.  At the hearing, Fenasci offered no allegation or evidence of any type of disability which would have
  mitigated his failure to appear.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Fenasci offered no explanation as to why, in the 4 weeks ensuing between service of the subpoena
  and its return date, he made no attempt to contact Deputy Disciplinary Counsel Bernadine Johnson, whose name, address
  and phone number are listed on the subpoena under the box entitled 'QUESTIONS MAY BE ADDRESSED TO:", in any manner
  with regard to his appearance on March 3, 1994.  No evidence was put forth that he attempted to obtain a continuance
  until his file could be located.  While Fenasci has no disciplinary record, he acknowledged that prior complaints
  against him had been resolved in his favor.  Thus he was not a stranger or first time participant in the
  investigatory process of the disciplinary system.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">To the contrary, Fenasci's first contact with Disciplinary Counsel in this matter, despite being
  sent a letter requesting a written response on November 2, 1993 and a second letter requesting a response on December
  16, 1993, was the delivery of his file four days after his non-appearance was required at a
  deposition.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The subpoena was validly issued and Fenasci personally served.  His failure to appear was a
  conscious and knowing act, one for which Fenasci is solely responsible.  The Board finds that Disciplinary Counsel
  has proven by clear and convincing evidence the violation of Rule 19, Section 9(C) and Rules
  of Professional Conduct 3.4(c), 8.1(b), 8.1(c), 8.4(a), 8.4(d) and 8.4(g) as set forth in the formal
  charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Hearing Committee apparently found that Fenasci's failure to appear caused no harm to the
  disciplinary system.  However his disregard for the subpoena and the authority that issued it has now caused the time
  and resources of the disciplinary system to be expended, particularly the efforts of 18 volunteer members, all
  because Fenasci simply choose to disregard the subpoena.<a name="fnref4" class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> It should be noted
  that had Fenasci provided a written response to the complaint, as was requested on two prior occasions, that the
  issuance of the subpoena would not have been necessary.  Indeed once his response and file were received, the
  complaint was dismissed on the merits shortly thereafter.  The only issue now remaining is the appropriate sanction
  for such misconduct.</p>

  <h2>SANCTION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Disciplinary Board finds that Fenasci's conduct was knowing, that he has violated duties owed
  to the legal system and the profession, causing the needless expenditure of the financial and personnel resources of
  the disciplinary system.  The ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, Section 9.22 Aggravating factors
  which are present include: (b) <span class="ABAstandard">selfish motive</span>; (1)
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>.  Mitigating factors are: (a)
  <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>; (d) <span class="ABAstandard">good faith
  effort to rectify consequences of misconduct</span>; (i) <span class="ABAstandard">delay in disciplinary
  proceedings</span> <a name="fnref5" class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> and (1) <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ABA Standard <span class="ABAstandard">6.22</span> provides that a suspension is generally
  appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates a court order or rule, and there is injury or potential injury to a
  client or a party, or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Due to the presence of several mitigating factors, particularly the fact that Fenasci has no
  prior disciplinary record, has expressed his remorse and submitted his file within a few days after his required
  appearance, the Disciplinary Board finds that a public reprimand coupled with 3 additional CLE hours in the field of
  ethics, as well as the payment of all costs of these proceedings to be sufficient discipline.<a name="fnref6" class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">It is hoped that by earning additional credits in ethics, that Fenasci will gain a better
  understanding of the need to comply with the rules of the disciplinary system as established by the Supreme
  Court.</p>
