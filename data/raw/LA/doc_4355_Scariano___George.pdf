<p>*************************************************************************************</p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This attorney disciplinary matter arises from two counts of formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) against respondent, George Scariano, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana.&nbsp; The charges allege violations of </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.1'></a>(a)<font size="3"> (competence), </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.3'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a><font size="3"> (diligence), </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.4'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a><font size="3"> </font><p>

<p><font size="3"><b>UNDERLYING FACTS</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The record indicates that in 1994, John Keys, a Texas attorney, retained respondent to file suit on behalf of PK Investments, Inc. in connection with an unpaid promissory note in the amount of $50,000.</font><font size="1"> </font><span class="CITE">1<font size="3">&nbsp; </font></span>Thereafter, respondent failed to file the suit, but falsely represented to Mr. Keys that the suit had been filed and the defendant was served pursuant to the long-arm statute.&nbsp; Additionally, respondent prepared an affidavit of correctness of note and non-military service, which were supposedly to obtain a default judgment, and forwarded it to Mr. Keys in Texas for his signature.&nbsp; Mr. Keys returned the affidavit to the respondent in May of 1995, but respondent still took no action.&nbsp; Mr. Keys last spoke to the respondent in December of 1995.&nbsp; He was advised by respondent that a default judgment would be secured in the first week of January 1996.</p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On February 21, 1996, Mr. Keys filed a complaint with the ODC after respondent failed to take or return any of his numerous phone calls.</font><span class="CITE"><font size="1"> 2</font><font size="3">&nbsp; </font></span>The ODC requested information from the respondent regarding the complaint.&nbsp; Although respondent was granted two fifteen-day extensions of time to respond to the </p>
<p><font size="3">ODC's request, he failed to do so.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondent appeared before the ODC pursuant to a subpoena;&nbsp; however, his deposition was continued when respondent requested time to obtain counsel.&nbsp; The deposition was again scheduled and continued on two other occasions so that respondent could obtain representing counsel.&nbsp; However, respondent never </font></p>
<p><font size="3">appeared before the ODC, nor did he file a written response to the complaint.</font></p>
<p><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On December 20, 1996, the ODC filed formal charges against respondent.&nbsp; The first count alleged respondent neglected to file suit on behalf of PK Investments, Inc., and failed to communicate with Mr. Keys, who was acting on its behalf.&nbsp; The second count alleged respondent failed to cooperate with the </font></p>
<p><font size="3">ODC in its investigation of this matter.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since the respondent failed to file an answer, no formal hearing was conducted, the matter was considered by the hearing committee on documentary evidence alone.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On May 12, 1997, the hearing committee filed its findings and recommendation with the disciplinary board.&nbsp; The committee concluded that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, both in his neglect of the legal matter and in his failure to cooperate with the ODC's investigation of that matter.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Considering these violations in light of respondent's prior disciplinary record,</font><font size="1"> 3</font><font size="3"> the committee recommended he be suspended from the practice of law for a period of three years.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On March 3, 1998, the disciplinary board issued its recommendation to this court.&nbsp; Like the hearing committee, the board noted respondent's conduct was knowing, if not intentional, and found he violated duties owed to his clients and the profession.&nbsp; With respect to the allegations of a failure to cooperate, the board stated respondent successfully delayed the disciplinary process for over six months by seeking continuances for his depositions.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After reviewing cases from this court involving similar misconduct,</font><font size="1"> </font><span class="CITE">4</span><font size="3"> and the presence of several aggravating factors,</font><font size="1"> </font><span class="CITE"> 5<font size="3"> </font></span>the board concurred in the committee's recommendation of a three year suspension.&nbsp; One board member rendered a concurrence stating he would have preferred imposition of a sanction </p>
<p><font size="3">of disbarment.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondent filed an objection in this court to the disciplinary board's recommendation.&nbsp; Accordingly, pursuant to </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s11'></a><font size="3">the matter was set for oral argument.</font></p>
<p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We find the disciplinary board's recommendation is supported by the record.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The evidence clearly establishes that respondent failed to file suit in this matter, and then attempted to deceive or mislead his client into believing the suit was filed, going so far as to send the client affidavits which supposedly </font></p>
<p><font size="3">had to be signed in connection with the non-existent suit.&nbsp; As to the failure to cooperate charge, the record demonstrates that respondent was given numerous opportunities to answer the charges against him, but failed to do so.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In his objection filed in this court, respondent asserts that he suffers from alcoholism and was unable to respond to the charges against him.&nbsp; In this court, respondent for the first time has employed counsel to represent him.&nbsp; Counsel has requested additional time to have respondent admitted into a program for treatment of his alcohol dependency, pointing out that this is the first time respondent has ever faced his substance abuse problem, which allegedly has been the underlying cause his disciplinary problems.&nbsp; Counsel has further requested a remand for the purpose of introducing evidence of the clients desire to withdraw the complaint.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondents failure to present evidence to the hearing committee that he suffers from alcohol dependency and that he is willing to seek treatment arguably is mitigated by the fact that he is for the first time willing to </font></p>
<p><font size="3">admit his problem.&nbsp; Of course, it is never too late for an alcoholic to cease denying the problem and to seek a new start.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the misconduct warrants a severe sanction, and nothing on the record justifies a deviation </font></p>
<p><font size="3">from the recommended sanction.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have decided to impose the recommended three-year suspension.&nbsp; However, because of the unique circumstances of this case, and in order to provide incentive for respondents recovery, we will allow respondent to apply for conditional readmission on probation</font><font size="1"> 6</font><font size="3"> after one year and one day if he </font></p>
<p><font size="3">registers with the Lawyers Program, or similar agency, and successfully undergoes treatment for his alcoholism.&nbsp; Under this proposal, the public is protected by the three-year suspension, but respondent is given a motivation </font></p>
<p><font size="3">for successfully addressing his problem.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>DECREE</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record, oral argument and brief filed by the ODC, it is the decision of this court that respondent, George Scariano, be </font>suspended<font size="3"> from the practice of law for a period of </font>three years<font size="3">.&nbsp; However, he may apply for </font>conditional readmission on probation in accordance with this opinion after one year and one day<font size="3">.&nbsp; All costs of these proceedings in the amount of $303.22 are assessed against respondent.</font></p>
