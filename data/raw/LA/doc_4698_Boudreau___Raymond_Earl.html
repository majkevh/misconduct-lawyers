  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: RAYMOND EARL BOUDREAU, JR.</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from one count of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Raymond Earl Boudreau, Jr., an attorney licensed to practice law in
  Louisiana but currently on suspension.</p>

  <h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY RECORD</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Before addressing the instant charges, we find it helpful to review respondent's prior
  disciplinary history.  Between 1998 and 1999, respondent neglected and abandoned two client matters, failed to
  communicate with three clients, failed to account for and return fees to one client, failed to satisfy student loan
  obligations and failed to cooperate with the ODC in four disciplinary investigations.  Pursuant to a consent petition
  filed in this court, we suspended respondent from the practice of law for a period of three years<i>. 
  <span class="CITE">In re: Boudreau</span></i><span class="CITE">, 00-3158 (La. 1/5/01),
  <a href="2001-01-05_2000-3158.htm">776 So. 2d 428</a></span> ("<i>Boudreau I</i>").  Respondent remains suspended
  under that judgment.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <h3>Donaldson Matter</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In 1997, Marvin Donaldson retained respondent for a $2,000 flat fee to represent him in criminal
  proceedings, in which he was charged with a fourth offense of driving while intoxicated.  Between June 1997 and
  September 1999, respondent made eleven court appearances and filed an appellate brief on behalf of Mr. Donaldson. 
  Thereafter, respondent failed to make any appearances on behalf of his client.  He made no effort to withdraw from
  the representation and instead simply abandoned Mr. Donaldson.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <h3>Failure to Cooperate</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In April 2001, four months after respondent had been suspended in <i>Boudreau I</i>, Mr.
  Donaldson filed a complaint with the ODC.  He maintained that he attempted to contact respondent in order to request
  a refund of his fee, but was unsuccessful in reaching respondent.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC forwarded Mr. Donaldson's complaint to respondent and requested he address the
  allegations.  Respondent failed to reply to the ODC's request. The ODC then sought to serve respondent with a
  subpoena compelling his appearance and production of documents at a sworn deposition, but was unable to serve him,
  despite six attempts to do so.  On September 21, 2001, respondent faxed a letter to the ODC indicating he would
  respond to the complaint within five days.  However, respondent failed to do so.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Formal Charges</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Following its investigation, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent based
  on his substantive misconduct in the Donaldson matter, as well as his failure to cooperate in the investigation of
  the Donaldson complaint.  The charges allege violations of Rules 1.3 (lack of diligence), 1.4(a) (failure to keep
  client reasonably informed about the status of legal matter and failure to comply with reasonable requests for
  information), 1.5(f)(6) (failure to account for or refund unearned fees, and/or place disputed funds in trust) and
  8.4(g) (failure to cooperate with the ODC) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, as well as Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
  9(c) (failure to respond to a lawful demand of a disciplinary authority).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges.  Accordingly, the factual
  allegations were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
  11(E)(3).  No formal hearing was held, but the parties were given an opportunity to file with the hearing committee
  written arguments and documentary evidence on the issue of sanctions.  Respondent made no filing with the
  committee.</p>

  <h3><a href="../HC/2002-10-28_02-DB-051.htm">Recommendation of the Hearing Committee</a></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The hearing committee found the formal charges were deemed admitted and, as such, proven by clear
  and convincing evidence pursuant to Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>Turning to the issue of an appropriate sanction, the committee recognized
  respondent's prior disciplinary record involving similar misconduct.  Relying on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing
  Lawyer Sanctions</i>, the committee noted the baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is suspension.  As
  aggravating factors, it recognized prior discipline, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct,
  vulnerability of the victim and indifference to making restitution.  It found no mitigating factors to be
  present. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Accordingly, the committee recommended respondent be suspended for a period of two years with the
  suspension commencing upon the completion of his suspension in <i>Boudreau I</i>.  It also recommended respondent be
  required to attend the Louisiana State Bar Association's Ethics School, obtain an additional five hours of continuing
  legal education on the subject of ethics, and provide restitution of the unearned portion of the fee with
  interest.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Neither party filed an objection to the findings and recommendation of the hearing committee.</p>

  <h3><a href="../DB/2003-07-03_02-DB-051.htm">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The board determined respondent accepted a flat fee to perform services that he did not perform
  and abandoned his client in violation of Rule 1.5.  It also pointed out respondent failed to appear in court on
  behalf of his client and failed to advise his client of such in violation of Rules 1.3 and 1.4, respectively. 
  Finally, the board stated respondent' s failure to respond to the complaint, especially considering his written
  assurance that he would, constituted a breach of Rule 8.4(g) and Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 9(c).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The board found respondent's conduct caused harm to his client by depriving him of his funds and
  delaying the resolution of his legal matter.  It further concluded respondent's failure to cooperate with the ODC
  caused delays and expense to the disciplinary system. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Relying on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, the board concluded the
  baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is a suspension from the practice of law.  The board adopted the
  aggravating factors cited by the committee, and agreed no mitigating factors were present.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In determining an appropriate sanction, the board observed the substantive misconduct occurred in
  1998, during the same time period as respondent's misconduct subject of <i>Boudreau I</i>, which occurred between
  1998 through 1999.  Relying on <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain</i>,
  <a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 So. 2d 470</a> (La. 1991)</span>, the board determined that if the underlying
  misconduct in this matter had been considered together with the misconduct at issue in <i>Boudreau I,</i> the same
  sanction (a three-year suspension) would have been imposed.  However, it determined respondent's  failure to
  cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the instant matter warranted additional discipline, as it occurred
  outside of the time frame of the conduct subject of <i>Boudreau I</i>.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Accordingly, the board recommended respondent be suspended for a period of thirty
  days for his failure to cooperate.  Additionally, it proposed respondent be required to obtain additional continuing
  legal education and that respondent provide an accounting and refund of all unearned fees to Mr. Donaldson.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">One board member partially dissented as to the leniency of the proposed sanction for the failure
  to cooperate, citing the egregiousness of the misconduct  in light of respondent's past disciplinary infractions for
  similar misconduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The ODC filed an objection to the leniency of the board's proposed sanction.  Accordingly, the
  matter was docketed for briefing and argument in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(G).  Respondent did not
  file a brief for the court's consideration, nor did he appear for oral argument.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The deemed admitted facts in this case support the conclusion respondent neglected his client's
  legal matter, failed to communicate with his client and failed to account for or return the unearned fee.  Therefore,
  the sole issue presented for our consideration is the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain
  high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future
  misconduct.  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So.
  2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.  The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness
  of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d
  520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent's abandonment of his client's legal matter caused actual harm.  Furthermore,
  respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation, thereby impairing the efficient operation of the
  disciplinary process.  No mitigating factors are supported by the record; however, several aggravating factors are
  present.  Under these circumstances, we conclude a suspension from the practice of law is the proper sanction.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain</i>, <a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 So.2d
  470</a> (La.1991), we observed that when the underlying conduct occurs within the same period as the misconduct
  forming the basis for a previous sanction, the discipline imposed should be determined as if both proceedings were
  before the court simultaneously.  The instant case presents an interesting variation on the <i>Chatelain</i> theme,
  as the substantive misconduct occurred during the same time frame as the misconduct in <i>Boudreau I</i>, but the
  failure to cooperate occurred after the <i>Boudreau I</i> opinion was rendered.  Under these circumstances, we must
  separate the substantive misconduct from the failure to cooperate.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The substantive misconduct consists of the abandonment of a client matter.  This misconduct is
  similar to <i>Boudreau I</i>, which involved, among other things, abandonment of two client matters.  Had the instant
  abandonment charge been considered filed simultaneously with those charges forming the basis of <i>Boudreau I</i>, it
  would have only reinforced our view that a lengthy suspension was warranted to sanction respondent for his misconduct
  and to protect the public.  Accordingly, we will adjudge respondent guilty of an additional violation which will be
  added to his record for consideration in the event he applies for reinstatement from <i>Boudreau I</i>, after
  becoming eligible to do so. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As to the failure to cooperate charge, we note this misconduct commenced in May 2001, five months
  after this court rendered its judgment in <i>Boudreau I</i>.  Additionally, respondent was sanctioned in <i>Boudreau
  I</i> for, among other misconduct, a failure to cooperate.  As such, this court's judgment placed respondent on
  notice that a failure to cooperate with disciplinary authorities appointed by this court will not be tolerated. 
  Respondent's continued failure to cooperate is, therefore, particularly egregious.  <i>See, e.g.</i>,
  <span class="cite"><i>In re: Casanova</i>, 02-2155 (La. 11/22/02), <a href="2002-11-22_2002-2155.htm">847 So. 2d
  1169</a></span> (prior discipline "presented respondent with an opportunity to correct his deficiencies, but it is
  obvious that he did not avail himself of the chances he was given").  Under these circumstances, we find a six-month
  suspension, to run consecutively to the suspension imposed in <i>Boudreau I</i>, is an appropriate sanction for
  respondent's failure to cooperate.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel's brief, it is ordered that Raymond Earl Boudreau,
  Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 24028, be adjudged of additional violations warranting a lengthy suspension for his
  substantive misconduct in the Donaldson matter.  These violations shall be added to his record for consideration in
  the event he seeks reinstatement from the suspension imposed in <i>In re: Boudreau</i>, 00-3158 (La. 1/5/01), 776 So.
  2d 428.  For his failure to cooperate in the disciplinary investigation of the Donaldson matter, it is ordered that
  respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months.  This suspension shall run consecutively
  to the suspension imposed in <i>In re: Boudreau</i>, 00-3158 (La. 1/5/01), 776 So. 2d 428.  All costs and expenses in
  the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to
  commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" class="fn" id="_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>In November 1999,
  the court of appeal received notice that respondent had been declared ineligible to practice law for failure to pay
  bar dues and comply with his mandatory continuing legal education requirements.  Accordingly, the court of appeal
