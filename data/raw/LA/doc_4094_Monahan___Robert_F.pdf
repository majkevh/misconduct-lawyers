<br>
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS<br>
<font face='Times New Roman'>PER CURIAM</font></p>
<p>*************************************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We consider here the <a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A8298?an=JD_92-DB-045 --##'>recommendation of the Disciplinary Board </a>of the Louisiana State Bar Association that Robert F. Monahan, who was admitted to practice law in the State of Louisiana in October of 1985, be disbarred because of violations our Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On March 30, 1992, followings a guilty plea in the United States District Court, Middle District of Louisiana, Robert F. Monahan was convicted of one count of aiding and abetting another to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of </font><span class="CITE">18 U.S.C. <font face='Courier New'>'</font><font face='Times New Roman'> 841 (a) (1)</font></span>.&nbsp; And, on June 15, 1992. he was convicted of one count of engaging in a transaction involving the proceeds of a <font face='Times New Roman'><u>drug</u></font><font face='Times New Roman'> offense in \violation of </font><span class="CITE">La.&nbsp; Rev.&nbsp; Stat. <font face='Courier New'>'</font><font face='Times New Roman'> 40:1049 D, </font></span>after he pled guilty in the 19th Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, State of Louisiana.&nbsp; Both convictions arose from a single factual circumstance.&nbsp; A captain with the East Baton <font face='Times New Roman'><u>Rouge</u></font><font face='Times New Roman'> Sheriff's Office testified in federal court concerning the facts which led </font>to the charges as follows:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before August 19, 1991, Robert Monahan began to participate with others in the possession and distribution of controlled substances.&nbsp; In August of 1991, Robert Monahan contacted an individual for the purposes of determining whether or not that individual had the monies for approximately a quarter kilogram of cocaine.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon being informed by that individual that the sale had been completed, Monahan instructed this individual to bring the cash proceeds of approximately seven thousand, two hundred dollars from this sale to Monahan's office.&nbsp; When the individual arrived at Monahan's office he was brought into the office and asked to put the money on the table.&nbsp; Monahan informed this individual that he would be meeting with the source of this individual's cocaine and would deliver the money from the sale of the quarter kilogram of cocaine to the source at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Monahan was aware that the cocaine was being distributed.&nbsp; He knowingly and willfully associated himself with the process of distributing the cocaine at a minimum by knowingly giving the proceeds to another who he knew to be directly involved in the distribution process.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a result of the guilty pleas in state and federal court, concurrent sentences of 33 months, to be followed by 3 Years supervised prooacion. imposed.&nbsp; The conviction of serious criminal conduct involved a violation of <span class="Rule"><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a> (b)<p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In December of 1989, Monahan was retained by Mamie Scott to represent her grandson, I. Allen, in the appeal of his criminal conviction for second degree murder.&nbsp; Although Monahan filed a motion to substitute counsel, a motion for an out of time appeal, which was granted, and determined the costs of appeal from the clerk of court, he did not complete the appeal. In fact, according to Ms. Scott, Monahan did not meet with her emotionally disturbed&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;grandson (a matter which the attorney disputes), and refused to answer her calls or to&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;meet with her about the progress of the appeal.&nbsp; Furthermore, he did <font face='Times New Roman'>not refund the advance fee of $1500.00 until the Office of the Disciplinary Counsel became involved in the matter.&nbsp; This conduct involving the failure to complete an appeal, failing to properly inform a client, failing to account for the fee paid and falling to refund the unearned portion of the fee violated </font><span class="Rule"><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.3'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.4'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.16'></a> (d), and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a> (a) and (c)<p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although Monahan was served with a subpoena to appear before the Disciplinary Counsel on December 19, 1991 to testify and to produce the file and financial records in the investigation into the complaint Filed against him by Myles Allen, the attorney did not appear at either this date or two re-scheduled dates in January of 1992.&nbsp; While Monahan claims to have produced the Allen file, a grand Jury subpoena for his court calendars, telephone records and office receipts had been issued with regard to a narcotics investigation so that his financial records purportedly could not be produced.&nbsp; Having failed. neglected, or refused to appear, Monahan was deemed by the Disciplinary Counsel to have obstructed its access to evidence, disobeyed an obligation under the rules of the tribunal, failed to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation, and engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of <span class="Rule"><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE3.4'></a> (a) (c), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.1'></a> (b) (c), and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a> (a) (d) (g) <p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Monahan cites other decisions of this Court, <span class="CITE"><u>Louisiana State Bar Association</u><font face='Times New Roman'>_ v. </font><font face='Times New Roman'><u>Porterfield</u></font><font face='Times New Roman'>, 550 So. 2d 584 (La. 1989), </font><font face='Times New Roman'><u>Louisiana State Bar Association v. Haberpgnier</u></font><font face='Times New Roman'>, 553 So. 2d 855 (La. 1989), and </font><font face='Times New Roman'><u>in Re:</u></font><font face='Times New Roman'>Harrington, 608 So. 2d 631 (La. 1992), </font></span>in which a suspension or public reprimand, rather than disbarment, was imposed.&nbsp; Although the infraction in <font face='Times New Roman'><u>Lagenfield</u></font><font face='Times New Roman'> did involve contraband. the Court found several mitigating factors, </font><font face='Times New Roman'>including the fact that. pursuant to the provisions of La.&nbsp; Code Crim.&nbsp; Proc. an. 893 (West 19 ). the trial court set aside his conviction.&nbsp; In </font><font face='Times New Roman'><u>Carpenter</u></font><font face='Times New Roman'>, the respondent was suspended for a period of thirty months after he performed minimal legal services for a client in a criminal matter and did not refund any of the advanced fee.&nbsp; However, his readmission was conditioned on a refund to the client.&nbsp; While the respondent in </font><font face='Times New Roman'><u>Harrington</u></font><font face='Times New Roman'> was only publicly reprimanded for his failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation, the Court noted that his actions caused no harm to his client, that he may</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="1"> </font><font face='Times New Roman'>have been confused by three simultaneous disciplinary proceedings, and that he did ultimately cooperate with the investigation.&nbsp; Furthermore, the discipline imposed in each of these matter involved only one of the violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct with which Monahan is charged.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the record of the<a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A735e?an=JD_92-DB-015 --##'> Disciplinary Board's</a> findings and recommendations, and the record filed herein, which, because of his negiect, lacked the Respondent's sworn testimony or other evidence regarding mitigating factors, it is the decision of this Court that the Disciplinary Board's recommendations be adopted.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accordingly, it is ordered that the name of Robert F. Monahan be stricken from the roll of attorneys and his right to practice law in the state of Louisiana revoked.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is further ordered that his disbarment be effective as of September 4, 1992, the date of his interim suspension.<br>
