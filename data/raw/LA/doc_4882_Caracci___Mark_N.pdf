  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-0027</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: MARK N. CARACCI</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that
  respondent neglected his clients' legal matters, failed to communicate with his clients, failed to expedite
  litigation, failed to properly supervise subordinate lawyers, and settled a legal matter without his client's
  approval. Respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent discipline. In that petition, the parties
  stipulated that respondent's conduct violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.2(a)</span> (scope of representation), <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (failure to act with
  reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), <span class="Rules">1.4(a)</span> (failure to
  communicate with a client), <span class="Rules">3.2</span> (failure to make reasonable efforts to expedite
  litigation), and <span class="Rules">5.1</span> (responsibilities of partners, managers, and supervisory lawyers). As
  a sanction, they proposed respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year and one day, deferred,
  subject to twenty-four (24) months of probation with conditions. Having reviewed the petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Mark N. Caracci,
  Louisiana Bar Roll number 3865, be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of one year and one
  day. It is further ordered that this suspension shall be deferred, subject to respondent's successful completion of a
  twenty-four (24) month period of probation governed by the conditions set forth in the petition for consent
  discipline. Any failure by respondent to comply with these conditions or additional misconduct by respondent during
  the probationary period may be grounds for making the deferred suspension executory or imposing additional
  discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
