<p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="headingstyle">NO. 07-B-0175</p>
<p class="headingstyle">IN RE: WILLIE J. NUNNERY</p>
<p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 21(A), the Office of Disciplinary 
Counsel ("ODC") filed this reciprocal discipline proceeding against respondent, 
Willie J. Nunnery, an attorney licensed to practice law in the States of 
Louisiana and 
Wisconsin, based upon discipline imposed by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">The underlying facts of this matter are set forth in detail in the opinion of 
the 
Supreme Court of Wisconsin, which is reported as In the Matter of Disciplinary 
Proceedings Against Nunnery, 2007 WI 1 (January 4, 2007). Based on the evidence 
developed in that proceeding, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin concluded that 
respondent failed to reduce a contingent fee to writing, neglected legal 
matters, failed 
to communicate with clients, and failed to provide competent representations in 
violation of numerous Rules of the Wisconsin Rules of Professional Conduct for 
Attorneys. As a sanction, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin suspended respondent's 
license to practice law for two months, effective February 6, 2007, with 
reinstatement 
conditioned upon respondent's payment of the disciplinary proceeding costs and 
the 
sanctions imposed upon him by the trial court in one of the underlying matters.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After receiving notice of the order of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, the 
ODC filed a motion to initiate reciprocal discipline in Louisiana, pursuant to 
Supreme 
Court Rule XIX, § 21. Attached to the motion was a certified copy of the order 
of the 
Supreme Court of Wisconsin. On January 30, 2007, this court rendered an order 
giving respondent and the ODC thirty days to raise any claim, predicated upon 
the 
grounds set forth in Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 21(D), that the imposition of 
identical discipline in Louisiana would be unwarranted and the reasons for that 
claim. 
Neither respondent nor the ODC filed a response to the court's order.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">The standard for imposition of discipline on a reciprocal basis is set forth in 
Supreme Court Rule XIX, §21(D), which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="inverted">D. Discipline to be Imposed. Upon the expiration of thirty 
days from service of the notice pursuant to the provisions 
of paragraph B, this court shall impose the identical 
discipline or disability inactive status unless disciplinary 
counsel or the lawyer demonstrates, or this court finds that 
it clearly appears upon the face of the record from which 
the discipline is predicated, that:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="inverted">(1) The procedure was so lacking in notice or 
opportunity to be heard as to constitute a 
deprivation of due process; or</p>
		<p class="inverted">(2) Based on the record created by the 
jurisdiction that imposed the discipline, there 
was such infirmity of proof establishing the 
misconduct as to give rise to the clear 
conviction that the court could not, consistent 
with its duty, accept as final the conclusion on 
that subject; or</p>
		<p class="inverted">(3) The imposition of the same discipline by 
the court would result in grave injustice or be 
offensive to the public policy of the 
jurisdiction; or</p>
		<p class="inverted">(4) The misconduct established warrants 
substantially different discipline in this state; 
or</p>
		<p class="inverted">(5) The reason for the original transfer to 
disability inactive status no longer exists.</p>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class="Bodycopy">In determining the appropriate measure of reciprocal discipline, we are not 
required to impose the same sanction as that imposed by the state in which the 
misconduct occurred. Nevertheless, only under extraordinary circumstances should 
there be a significant variance from the sanction imposed by the other 
jurisdiction. 
In re: Aulston, 05-1546 (La. 1/13/06), 918 So. 2d 461.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Applying the factors set forth in Supreme Court Rule XIX, §21(D), we see no 
reason to deviate from the sanction imposed by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. 
Although we may well have imposed greater discipline if this misconduct had 
occurred in Louisiana, we find it appropriate to defer to the determination made 
by 
Wisconsin, with which we share authority over respondent. See, e.g., In re 
Zdravkovich, 831 A.2d 964, 968-69 (D.C. 2003) ("there is merit in according 
deference, 
for its own sake, to the actions of other jurisdictions with respect to the 
attorneys over 
whom we share supervisory authority"). Accordingly, we will impose a two-month 
suspension as reciprocal discipline pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 21.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering the motion for reciprocal discipline filed by the Office of 
Disciplinary Counsel and the record filed herein, it is ordered that Willie J. 
Nunnery, 
Louisiana Bar Roll number 15027, be suspended from the practice of law for a 
period 
of two months.</p>

<hr>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1">1</a> The trial court assessed $16,473 in attorney fees as a sanction against 
respondent based on his 
filing of a frivolous employment discrimination claim.
