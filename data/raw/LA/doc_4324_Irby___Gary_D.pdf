<p><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After investigating the complainants, the ODC instituted formal charges against respondent, alleging violation of<span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"><font face='Times New Roman'> Rules </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.3'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.4'></a> (b), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.8'></a> (c), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15'></a> (b), and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a> (a)(b)(c) and (g) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; Respondent was served with notice of all ten counts against him on June 3, 1998 by certified mail.<sup>3 </sup> Respondent failed to submit an answer to any of the charges, and the matter was submitted to the hearing committee on documentary evidence only. The ODC argued respondent violated duties owed to his client, that the mental element involved is intentional, and that the harm done to his clients in many respects has been substantial, particularly in the financial harm he has caused through his conversions. The ODC recognized the following factors in aggravation: prior disciplinary offense;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp; dishonest or selfish motive; a pattern of misconduct; multiple offenses;&nbsp; bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary process by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency; refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct; victim vulnerability; substantial experience in the practice of law; and indifference to making restitution.&nbsp; The ODC indicated there were no mitigating factors, and suggested that the only reasonable sanction is disbarment.<p>
<p><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Ac5d7?an=JD_HC9829 --##'><b>Hearing Committee Recommendation</b></a><b></b></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hearing committee concluded respondent violated<span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"><font face='Times New Roman'> Rules </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.3'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.4'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.1'></a> (c) and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a> (b)(c) and (g) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The committee noted that respondent's misconduct extends over a protracted period of time, reflects dishonesty, self-dealing, and absolutely no remorse. Citing respondent's lengthy history of complete disregard for the rights of his clients and the harm done to them and the legal system, the committee recommended disbarment.<p>
<p><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A730b?an=JD_98-DB-029 --##'>Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font><font color="#000000">The disciplinary board concurred in the findings of the hearing committee, finding all charges were proved by clear and convincing evidence.&nbsp; The board found respondent violated duties owed to the legal system, the profession and the public, and he has engaged in knowing and intentional misconduct.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pursuant to &sect;&sect; 4.41 and 7.1 of the </font><font color="#000000"><i>A.B.A. Standards for Imposing Lawyer Discipline</i></font><font color="#000000">, the board noted disbarment is the baseline sanction.&nbsp; Recognizing the fact that respondent was already disbarred, the board recommended the minimum period for respondent to apply for readmission be extended by another five years, to run from the date of finality of the court's judgment in this matter.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the recommendation of the disciplinary board.</p>
<p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The record supports the findings of fact made by the hearing committee and disciplinary board that respondent committed the professional misconduct as charged. Respondent knowingly and intentionally converted funds from his clients, and he later failed to provide restitution. This conduct, combined with his prior disbarment based on similar actions,' clearly indicates respondent lacks the moral fitness to practice. Iaw and is a threat to his clients, the profession and the public.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Recognizing that respondent is already disbarred, we will <font face='Times New Roman'>extend the</font> <font face='Times New Roman'>minimum period</font> for readmission pursuant to  for <font face='Times New Roman'>an additional five years</font> from the finality of the instant judgment.&nbsp; <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Assn v. Krasnoff</i>, 502 So. 2d 1018 (La. 1987).</span></p>
<p><b>DECREE</b></p>
<p><span class="BodyText2"><font color="#000000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accordingly, it is ordered that respondent, G. Don Irby, is prohibited from petitioning this court for readmission pursuant to </font><font color="#000000"> until five years have passed from the finality of this judgment.&nbsp; It is further ordered that respondent make full restitution to his former clients with legal interest.&nbsp; All costs and expenses of these proceedings are assessed to respondent in accordance with </font></span></p>
