  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-1256</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: PAUL T. VOIRON</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) commenced an investigation into allegations that
  respondent neglected his clients' legal matters, failed to communicate with his clients, and failed to make
  reasonable efforts to expedite litigation. Respondent initially failed to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation. After the filing of formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent
  discipline, in which they stipulate that respondent's conduct violated Rules  <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (failure
  to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), <span class="Rules">1.4</span> (failure to
  communicate with a client), <span class="Rules">3.2</span> (failure to make reasonable efforts to expedite
  litigation), and <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct. Having reviewed the petition for consent discipline,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that Paul T. Voiron, Louisiana Bar Roll number 22659, be and he hereby is suspended
  from the practice of law for one year and one day. It is further ordered that the suspension shall be deferred,
  subject to respondent's successful completion of a two-year period of supervised probation governed by the conditions
  set forth in the petition for consent discipline. Any violation of the conditions of probation, or any other
  misconduct during the probationary period, may be grounds for making the deferred suspension executory, or imposing
  additional discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
