<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The disciplinary board found respondent has acknowledged that he engaged in the misconduct set forth in the petition for consent discipline.&nbsp; The board found that respondent violated a duty owed to the legal system. the public, and the profession, and that respondent's misconduct was knowing. intentional, and caused actual harm to respondent's clients and to third parties.&nbsp; The board identified several aggravating factors, including dishonest and selfish motive, a pattern of misconduct. and multiple offenses, but only one mitigating factor, lack of prior discipline.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Given the seriousness of the misconduct, coupled with the significant aggravating factors, the board concluded the proposed consent discipline is appropriate<span class="CITE">(FN2)</span>. Accordingly, the board recomniended respondent be disbarred from the practice of law, effective the date of his interim suspension.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither respondent nor the GDC filed an objection in this court to the recommendation of the disciplinary board.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman'><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp; Respondent has admitted to numerous violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, including several instances of commingling and conversion of client funds.&nbsp; Respondent's actions conclusively demonstrate he lacks the fitness to practice law in this state.&nbsp; Based on our review of the record, we conclude disbarment is the appropriate sanction under the circumstances. Accordingly, we will accept the petition for consent discipline.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that the name of Glen Edward Smith be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.&nbsp; Respondent is ordered to make fall restitution to his clients.&nbsp; All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with . , with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
