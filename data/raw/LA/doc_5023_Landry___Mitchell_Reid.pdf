  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-1871</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: MITCHELL REID LANDRY</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, Mitchell Reid Landry, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The underlying facts are largely undisputed. Respondent was admitted to the Louisiana bar in
  April 1996. In March 1997, respondent accepted a position as a title attorney with Authentic Title, Ltd.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In July 1997, respondent acted as the closing attorney for a transaction involving Walter
  Wallendorf ("Walter"), who wished to refinance his home. Because Walter's wife, Patsy Wallendorf ("Patsy"), had died
  several months earlier, respondent determined that it was necessary to open a succession to complete the refinancing.
  Walter informed respondent that he and Patsy had no children and no property other than the home and its furnishings.
  Walter also told respondent that "there was no will" when Patsy died. When respondent asked Walter for the names of
  witnesses who could verify these facts, Walter informed respondent that he and Patsy had not socialized much and that
  he could not think of any witnesses who could provide the information.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Thereafter, respondent prepared an affidavit of death and heirship based solely on the
  information provided by Walter. The affidavit stated that Patsy died intestate. Walter signed the affidavit and
  respondent notarized it. A second affidavit was executed by Kelly Jones and Heather St. Amant, two notarial
  secretaries employed by Authentic Title, repeating the information contained in Walter's affidavit. These secretaries
  swore in the affidavit that they were "well acquainted" with Patsy and knew that she had died intestate. Respondent
  reviewed the Jones/St. Amant affidavit and notarized it. The affidavits were included with a petition for possession
  signed by respondent and filed in the matter entitled Succession of Patsy Ruth Wallendorf, No. 513-162 on the docket
  of the 24th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson. In August 1997, the court rendered a judgment of
  possession in favor of Walter.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Approximately one year later, respondent learned that Patsy had in fact died testate. In 1994,
  Patsy had executed a will leaving all of her assets, including the Wallendorf home, to Michael Bradford Walker and
  Jennifer Brooke Walker ("Michael and Jennifer"), the children of Shirley Walker ("Shirley"). Walter apparently
  believed that his wife had rescinded that will shortly before her death in 1997, leaving her without a will.
  Subsequently, Shirley retained counsel and brought an action to annul the 1997 judgment of possession. Walter
  represented himself in the litigation. At the conclusion of the proceeding, the court set aside the earlier judgment
  of possession in Walter's favor and appointed Shirley as the testamentary executrix of Patsy's succession.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In July 2000, Michael and Jennifer filed a civil suit against respondent and others. During the
  course of the litigation, Heather St. Amant testified that neither she nor Ms. Jones knew Patsy at the time they
  executed the affidavit attesting that they were "well acquainted" with Patsy and knew she had died intestate. Ms. St.
  Amant testified that she signed the affidavit, even though she did not know Patsy, because she was told to do so. In
  October 2001, Michael and Jennifer settled their suit for $70,000, which sum was paid by Authentic Title.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Following its investigation of a complaint filed by Shirley, the ODC filed one count of formal
  charges against respondent, alleging that his conduct violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">3.3(a)(1)</span>
  (knowingly making a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging
  in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span>
  (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent answered the formal charges, admitting most of the factual allegations and admitting
  that he violated the cited Rules of Professional Conduct "by virtue of his submission of affidavits in which the
  affiants declared personal knowledge of facts that they did not know, although in good faith believed to be
  true."<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This matter then proceeded to a formal hearing on the merits, at which respondent and Shirley
  Walker testified. In addition, respondent offered testimony, both in person and by letter and affidavit, attesting to
  his good character and reputation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-12-02_04-DB-049.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After considering this matter, the hearing committee made factual findings as follows:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent relied upon Walter's representations that he and Patsy had no children and had no
  property other than their residence and its furnishings and contents. Respondent also relied upon Walter's
  representations that Patsy did not execute a will and died intestate. When respondent questioned Walter regarding
  witnesses who could verify these facts, Walter advised respondent that he could not think of anyone who could execute
  the appropriate affidavits of death and heirship. Assuming Walter's representations were accurate, respondent
  prepared an affidavit of death and heirship for Walter's signature. Respondent or another employee of Authentic Title
  prepared a second affidavit wherein employees of Authentic Title alleged to have personal knowledge of the facts that
  Walter represented to respondent. Respondent notarized the second affidavit even though he knew or should have known
  the employees did not have the requisite personal knowledge to execute the affidavit. When Patsy's succession was
  filed with the court, Walter was recognized as the sole heir and placed in possession of all of the property in the
  succession. Some two years later, Shirley brought an action to annul the judgment of possession in favor of Walter.
  Shirley represented to the court that Patsy had died testate and Shirley's children were the proper heirs to the
  succession. An ancillary litigation was filed seeking recovery against respondent and others for the errors outlined
  above. That litigation was settled in October 2001, giving the injured parties $70,000 in settlement of their
  claim.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these factual findings and respondent's stipulations in his answer, the committee
  determined that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges. The committee
  found mitigating factors to be present, namely "the relative inexperience of the respondent, the respondent's
  reliance upon the statements of his client, and the lack of any motive to do harm to any party." The committee
  determined that instead of taking the time to investigate Walter's statements, respondent gave into pressure to
  expedite the refinancing process. The committee further determined that in doing so, respondent made an error which
  was not motivated by financial gain and was probably made because respondent believed he was expediting a matter that
  was both truthful and accurate. Respondent's error caused financial loss, which has been resolved by the courts.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee was impressed by the character witness and character affidavits submitted by
  respondent for consideration. The committee also felt that respondent's error was "one that all people in all
  professions are confronted with at the beginning of their careers."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, the committee recommended that respondent be publicly reprimanded. The
  ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2005-05-20_04-DB-046.htm">Ruling of the Disciplinary Board</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After review, the disciplinary board determined that the hearing committee's factual findings
  were not manifestly erroneous. Furthermore, the board determined the committee properly found that respondent had
  violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board found that respondent's conduct was negligent as to the 8.4(c) and (d) violations;
  however, his violation of Rule 3.3(a)(1) was knowing. It determined his conduct caused harm to both Shirley's
  children and Walter, because Shirley's children were required to file a lawsuit to have the appropriate will
  recognized by the court, and Walter was forced to defend himself in the proceeding. It concluded the lawsuit might
  have been avoided had respondent investigated Patsy's succession issues. Nevertheless, it recognized Shirley's
  children received $70,000 in settlement of their malpractice claim against respondent and others.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board determined that the baseline sanction in this matter is a public reprimand. It found no
  aggravating factors present. In mitigation, it noted the following: absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, timely
  good faith effort to make restitution or to rectify the consequences of the misconduct, full and free disclosure to
  the disciplinary board and a cooperative attitude toward the proceedings, inexperience in the practice of law
  (admitted 1996), character or reputation, and remorse.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Finding that the case law supports a public reprimand for the misconduct at issue, the board
  ordered that respondent be publicly reprimanded.<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a> It further
  ordered that he be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Three members of the disciplinary board dissented on the issue of an appropriate sanction.
  Relying on <span class="cite">In re: Wahlder, 98-2742 (La. 1/15/99), <a href="1999-01-15_1998-2742.htm">728 So. 2d
  837</a></span>, the dissenting board members would recommend that respondent be suspended from the practice of law
  for six months, with all but thirty days deferred.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC sought review of the disciplinary board's ruling in this court. We ordered the parties to
  submit briefs addressing the issue of whether the record supports the board's report. After reviewing the briefs
  filed by both parties, we docketed the matter for oral argument.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316
  (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in
  any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the
  manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings. See <span class="cite">In re: Caulfield,
  96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class="cite">In re:
  Pardue, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the stipulations by respondent and other evidence in the record, we find respondent
  notarized and caused to be filed into a succession proceeding two affidavits that he knew or should have known
  contained false information. As respondent has admitted, there is clear and convincing evidence which establishes
  that he has violated Rules <span class="Rules">3.3(a)(1)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span>, and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found evidence of professional misconduct, we now turn to a determination of the
  appropriate sanction for respondent's actions. In considering that issue, we are mindful that disciplinary
  proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the
  profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis,
  <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">With regard to the affidavit of death and heirship executed by Walter, stating that Patsy died
  without leaving a will, we find respondent's conduct was largely negligent. Although respondent probably should have
  undertaken a more detailed investigation to confirm the correctness of Walter's statement that Patsy died intestate,
  there was nothing in the statement to indicate it was false on its face.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The same cannot be said of the affidavit executed by respondent's office staff. It is undisputed
  that respondent knew his notarial secretaries were not "well acquainted" with Patsy, and that they had no personal
  knowledge of whether she died intestate. The only logical conclusion which can be drawn from respondent's actions is
  that he knowingly and intentionally filed this false affidavit into the court records. Respondent's actions caused
  actual harm to Walter and Shirley's children. In addition, respondent's actions caused harm to the court system,
  which must be able to rely on the truthfulness of representations made by counsel. The baseline sanction for
  respondent's misconduct is a suspension from the practice of law. See In re: Wahlder, 98-2742 (La. 1/15/99),
  <a href="1999-01-15_1998-2742.htm">728 So. 2d 837</a>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In mitigation, we accept the hearing committee's finding that respondent did not file this
  affidavit with any improper motive. As the committee observed, respondent sincerely believed that Walter's
  representation that his wife died intestate was truthful and accurate, and his actions were undertaken with the
  intent of expediting the refinancing of Walter's home. We also recognize the absence of a prior disciplinary record,
  respondent's full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board and cooperative attitude toward the proceedings,
  inexperience in the practice of law at the time of the offense, good character and reputation, and remorse. We are
  unable to discern any aggravating factors from the record.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering all the circumstances, we find the appropriate sanction in this case is a six-month
  suspension from the practice of law. In light of the substantial mitigating factors present, and the absence of any
  aggravating factors, we will defer all but thirty days of the suspension, subject to the condition that any
  misconduct during a six-month period may be grounds for making the deferred portion of the suspension executory, or
  imposing additional discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, briefs, and oral argument, it is ordered that Mitchell Reid Landry, Louisiana Bar Roll
  number 24147, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months. It is further ordered that all but
  thirty days of the suspension shall be deferred and respondent shall be placed on unsupervised probation for six
  months, subject to the condition that any misconduct during this period may be grounds for making the deferred
  portion of the suspension executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate. All costs and expenses in the
  matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to
  commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
