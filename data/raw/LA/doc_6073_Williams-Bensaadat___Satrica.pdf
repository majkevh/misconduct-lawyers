<p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="headingstyle">NO. 07-B-1618</p>
<p class="headingstyle">IN RE: SATRICA WILLIAMS-BENSAADAT</p>
<p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) commenced an investigation into 
allegations that respondent failed to competently represent her clients, 
neglected legal 
matters, failed to communicate with her clients, engaged in conduct constituting 
a 
conflict of interest, and allowed her clients' cases to prescribe. Prior to the 
filing of 
formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent 
discipline, in which respondent admits that her conduct violated Rules 1.1(a), 
1.2, 1.3, 
1.4, 1.9, and 1.16(d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Having reviewed the 
petition for consent discipline,</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that 
Satrica Williams-Bensaadat, Louisiana Bar Roll number 26142, be publicly 
reprimanded.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that respondent shall be placed on probation for 
a period of two years, subject to the conditions set forth in the joint petition 
for 
consent discipline.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are 
assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, 
with 
legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's 
judgment until paid.</p>
