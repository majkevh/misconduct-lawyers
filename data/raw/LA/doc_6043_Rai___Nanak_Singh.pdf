  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 07-B-0973</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: NANAK SINGH RAI</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that respondent failed to properly monitor his client trust account and commingled client and personal funds in the account. Following the institution of formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent discipline. Having reviewed the petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Nanak Singh Rai, Louisiana Bar Roll number 22852, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year. This suspension shall be deferred in its entirety, subject to respondent's successful completion of a one-year period of unsupervised probation governed by the terms and conditions set forth in the Petition for Consent Discipline. The probationary period shall commence from the date respondent and the ODC execute a formal probation plan. Any failure of respondent to comply with the conditions of probation, or any misconduct during the probationary period, may be grounds for making the deferred suspension executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
