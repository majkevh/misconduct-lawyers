  <p class="headingstyle">LOUISIANA ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: WINSTON R. DAY</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">DOCKET NUMBER: 97-DB-059</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">QRDER</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This matter came before the Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board as a Petition for Consent
  Discipline. Respondent Winston R. Day was arrested and charged with possession of 1.3 ounces of marijuana. Even
  though his activities did not result in a criminal conviction, he does not deny the underlying allegations of
  misconduct. Accordingly, Respondent, with the concurrence of Disciplinary Counsel, requests that the Board recommend
  approval of his Petition for Consent Discipline and that the Court enter an Order decreeing a Public Reprimand.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent has been a member of the Louisiana bar since 1970. He has been associated with the
  Louisiana State University School of Law for most of his career, serving as a professor and, until recently, as
  Chancellor. He has no prior disciplinary record.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The facts in this matter are simple as outlined in Disciplinary Counsel's Memorandum:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>On January 5, 1996, the respondent returned to the United States following a period of vacation in Europe. While
    in Amsterdam, the respondent reportedly acquired a small quantity of marijuana in a tourist bar where possession
    and use has been legalized. The respondent subsequently placed the marijuana in a pocket of his jacket and later
    packed the clothing in his suitcase.</p>

    <p>Upon arrival at the Atlanta Airport in Georgia, Customs Officials with the use of a drug sniffing dog confronted
    the respondent who acknowledged his possession of the marijuana. The respondent's explanation then and today is
    that he simply forgot of its existence. The respondent reportedly cooperated fully with officials in Clayton
    County, Georgia who subsequently arrested the respondent charging him with possession of 1.3 ounces of marijuana.
    Thereafter, local authorities deferred to federal Customs Officials who investigated the respondent thoroughly.
    Finding that he met all the requirements of the Federal Pretrial Diversion Program designed for first offenders,
    the respondent was offered participation in same in lieu of a criminal conviction.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent has completed his Pro-trial Diversion Program.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Even though his conduct did not result in a criminal conviction, the underlying misconduct
  violates Rule <span class="Rules">8.4(b)</span>. Respondent's conduct was a violation of both state and federal law.
  However, all evidence gathered by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel confirms that the 'respondent has no prior
  criminal record, no history of drug use or abuse, has no prior disciplinary record, and has heretofore enjoyed an
  excellent reputation in the legal community in Louisiana and elsewhere."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">While discipline is appropriate, the type of discipline to be imposed Is the question presented
  for review, Is the public reprimand too harsh, and if so, does the Disciplinary Board have authority to recommend
  rejection for that reason, In light of <span class="cite"><i>In re Glenn A. Lieberman,</i> 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96);
  <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So.2d 272</a></span>? Is the public reprimand too lenient? Or, is it
  within the range of discipline that is acceptable for consent discipline?</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In assessing discipline, the Board reviews the factors In Supreme Court Rule XIX and the ABA
  Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions. Further, the Board reviews discipline in light of its purpose which is not
  to punish the respondent, but to preserve the integrity of the profession, to safeguard the public, and to deter
  other attorneys from misconduct. <span class="cite"><i>LSBA v. Keys,</i> <a href="../SC/1990-09-07_1988-2441.htm">567
  So.2d 588</a> (La. 1990)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Rule XIX, Section 10c. requires the Board to consider the following:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system,
  or to the profession. Although there is no violation to a duty owed to a client or the legal system, Respondent has
  certainly violated his duty to the public and the legal profession. His actions have brought embarrassment and
  disrepute upon members of the bar.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently. All the evidence Indicates
  that Respondent acted negligently, rather than knowingly or intentionally.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(3) the amount of the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct. Other than
  the humiliation caused to himself, his family, the LSU Law Center, and the Louisiana legal community, there is no
  actual or potential Injury.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors. Under the ABA Standards for Imposing
  Lawyer Sanctions, there are no aggravating factors other than Respondent's substantial experience in the practice of
  law. The enumerated factors are, however, illustrative, rather than exclusive. In this case, another aggravating
  factor is the public and leadership role Respondent Winston Day held as Chancellor of the LSU School of Law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On the other hand, there are numerous mitigating factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">a. <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>. Respondent has
    practiced for 27 years with no prior discipline;</p>

    <p class="inverted">b. <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest or selfish motive</span>;</p>

    <p class="inverted">c. <span class="ABAstandard">timely good faith effort to rectify consequences of
    misconduct</span>;</p>

    <p class="inverted">d. <span class="ABAstandard">full and free disclosure to the disciplinary agency and
    cooperative attitude toward the proceedings</span>;</p>

    <p class="inverted">e. <span class="ABAstandard">character or reputation</span>;</p>

    <p class="inverted">f. <span class="ABAstandard">interim rehabilitation as evidenced by his completion of the
    pretrial diversionary program</span>;</p>

    <p class="inverted">g. <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>;</p>

    <p class="inverted">h. <span class="ABAstandard">imposition of other penalties or sanctions</span>. This factor
    requires elaboration. Respondent has suffered severe repercussions for his actions. He has had to resign as
    Chancellor of the LSU School of Law and has suffered tremendously from the publicity surrounding his arrest. His
    reputation will be forever tainted by his mugshot that appeared with front page headlines in the Baton Rouge
    <i>Advocate</i> and other newspapers throughout the state. He has been the subject of ridicule and humiliation
    brought upon by himself and his own inexplicable behavior. One moment of weakness and poor judgment has ruined this
    distinguished legal scholar's career.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">An admonition is the discipline which is appropriate in cases involving criminal activity which
  does not involve dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, but does adversely reflect on a Respondent's
  fitness as a lawyer. Section <span class="ABAstandard">5.14</span>, ABA Standards.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A reprimand would be appropriate if Respondent knowingly engaged in conduct that involved
  dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation and that adversely reflects on the lawyer's fitness to practice law.
  Section <span class="ABAstandard">5.13</span>, ABA Standards.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent's conduct seems to warrant an admonition. However, Disciplinary Counsel and Respondent
  have agreed to a public reprimand, not because Respondent engaged in dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation,
  but because of the 'significant embarrassment and the potential for harm to the profession."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The only other Louisiana disciplinary case involving possession of marijuana as the sole offense
  was <span class="cite"><i>LSBA v. Hingle,</i> File #6645-A (1982)</span>. In that case, Gilmer Hingle was given a
  formal public reprimand by the Committee on Professional Responsibility. However, this matter was not the subject of
  formal charges; nor was it issued by the Louisiana Supreme Court. A reading of the public record in the criminal
  proceedings In the Gilmer Hingle case reveals that he was initially charged with felony possession of marijuana with
  intent to distribute. As a result of a plea bargain, he was convicted of three counts of possession of marijuana,
  sentenced to over eight months of imprisonment, all suspended upon successful completion of two years probation.
  <i>State of Louisiana v. Gilmer P. Hingle,</i> #40,194, M:46545, M: 46546, 4th Judicial District Court, Quachita
  Parish, Louisiana. Certainly, Gilmer Hingle's charges and conduct were considerably more heinous than
  Respondent's.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under the ABA guidelines, Winston Day's discipline should be an admonition. However, in light of
  <i>Lieberman, supra,</i> this Board cannot reject a consent discipline because it is too harsh. It is clear to the
  Board that Disciplinary Counsel and Winston Day have agreed to the harsher discipline of a public reprimand because
  of the public nature of Winston Day's position as Chancellor of the LSU School of Law. Because his role was one of
  example for future lawyers, his discipline should be public to serve as an example for others. While a less public
  lawyer with similar conduct would have been in line for an admonition, Respondent is receiving a harsher penalty
  because of his public position. Because Respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have agreed to this discipline, the
  Disciplinary Board cannot reject it as too harsh. A public reprimand is certainly not too lenient. It Is within the
  range of discipline appropriate for this misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, the Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board approves the Petition for Consent
  Discipline and hereby issues a public reprimand to Respondent Winston Day, at his costs.</p>
