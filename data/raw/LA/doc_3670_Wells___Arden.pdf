  <p class="headingstyle">NUMBER 98-DB-071</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: ARDEN WELLS</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of formal charges by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel against Arden Wells of Ponchatoula, Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Formal charges consisting of one count were filed on September 14, 1998.  Respondent answered the
  charges on October 27, 1998 admitting to the facts contained in the charge, but denying that his actions constituted
  an ethical violation.  On January 12, 1999, Respondent filed a Petition for Consent Discipline with the Board
  requesting a formal public reprimand.  The Office of Disciplinary filed its concurrence on January 15, 1999.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter on February 25, 1999.  Respondent appeared
  and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel was represented by Deputy Counsel Robert S. Kennedy, Jr.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Count I alleges that on December 5, 1995, Respondent filed a 42 U.S.C. '1983 action in the United
  States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana against state court Judge A.J. Kling, Jr., Julie Cullen,
  Assistant Attorney General of Louisiana, and Vicki Singletary, secretary to Judge Kling.  That petition alleged
  generally that Respondent's civil rights had been violated by the three defendants when they caused a bench warrant
  to be issued for his arrest.  The bench warrant for Respondent's arrest was issued for his failure to appear at a
  sentencing hearing of one of his criminal defendants.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In connection with that litigation, Respondent was advised on numerous occasions by counsel for
  the defendants, by Magistrate Judge Reidlinger, and by Judge Kling himself, that the defendants were subject to
  absolute immunity and, therefore, the '1983 action filed by Respondent lacked merit and would be dismissed. 
  Respondent conducted little or no research or investigation to determine whether absolute immunity was available to
  the defendants and whether his action was well founded in law.  Instead, Respondent chose to continue to maintain the
  litigation, even in the face of evidence that the lawsuit was frivolous.  Respondent chose to appeal the adverse
  judgment dismissing the complaint.  Moreover, even after having been found to have violated Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 11 by
  bringing frivolous and harassing litigation and having been sanctioned under the Rule, Respondent appealed the
  court's finding and continued to maintain the '1983 action by appealing the case to the United States Fifth Circuit
  Court of Appeals.  This conduct caused considerable expense to the defendants.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Additionally, opposing counsel attempted to avoid further expense for the clients by suggesting,
  prior to the Rule 11 hearing, that they would forego any claim for attorney's fees if Respondent would stop pursuing
  the meritless litigation.  Respondent responded by filing a complaint with the ODC alleging that opposing counsel
  acted improperly and unethically.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">It is alleged that this conduct was reckless and irresponsible, and constituted a wilful abuse of
  the judicial process, thereby violating Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.1</span>,
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span>, <span class="allegedrules">3.1</span>, <span class="allegedrules">3.5</span>,
  and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX '10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a finding of
  lawyer misconduct, the court or board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1)  whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to   the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2)  whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3)  the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4)  the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The  Board finds that Respondent is guilty of the misconduct set forth in petition for consent
  discipline by clear and convincing evidence.  The Board finds that Respondent has violated duties owed to the
  profession and the legal system, and has engaged in reckless and irresponsible misconduct. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board finds the following <i>A.B.A. Standards</i> '9.22 aggravating factor to be present: 
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>.  The <i>A.B.A. Standards</i> '9.32
  mitigating factors are a <span class="ABAstandard">cooperative attitude toward these proceedings</span>; the
  <span class="ABAstandard">imposition of other sanctions</span>, and an <span class="ABAstandard">absence of dishonest
  or selfish motive</span>. </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In consent disciplines, the Board may reject proposed discipline as too lenient, but when
  Respondent and disciplinary counsel have agreed that a violation has occurred, it may not reject consent discipline
  claiming that there was no violation. <span class="CITE"><i>See In re: Lieberman,</i> 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96);
  <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So.2d 272</a></span>.  The Disciplinary Board therefore orders that
  Respondent, Arden Wells, be issued a public reprimand and further orders that he be assessed with all costs and
  expenses of  these proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this
  Ruling until paid.</p>
