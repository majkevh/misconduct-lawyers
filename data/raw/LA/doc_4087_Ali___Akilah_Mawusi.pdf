NO. 97-B-0143<br>
IN RE: CONNIE WELCOME-SADLER&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS<br>
</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>PER CURIAM'<br>
</p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font color="#000000">Respondent, Connie Welcome-Sadler, was charged in 1995 with six counts of formal charges by disciplinary counsel.&nbsp; The conduct, all of which occurred prior to 1990, involved several instances of failure to refund unearned fees and two instances of commingling and conversion of client funds. </font></span><span class="CITE">1</span><span class="BodyText"><font color="#000000"> Subsequently, respondent made restitution to all the complainants.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font color="#000000">Respondent initially filed a</font><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3A9d4e?an=JD_95-DB-001 --##'> motion for consent discipline,<font face='Times New Roman'> which was </font>rejected<font face='Times New Roman'> by the disciplinary board</font></a></span><span class="CITE">.</span><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000"> </font><font color="#000000">Thereafter, formal charges were filed, and a hearing was held before the hearing committee.&nbsp; Respondent filed an untimely response through her counsel, essentially admitting all of the formal charges.&nbsp; She proposed to the committee that it find her previously rejected consent discipline to be appropriate.&nbsp; Disciplinary counsel timely submitted his prior concurrence in the previously-rejected proposed discipline.</font></span></p>
<p><a href='#!-- #ID:%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20LOUISIANA%20%3Ar%3Ae32c?an=JD_HC9527 --##'><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman'>The hearing committee </font></span></a><font face='Times New Roman'></font><font color="#000000">concluded that respondent had violated </font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules">Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.2'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.4'></a>, and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15'></a>(a)(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct <font color="#000000">and recommended a</font><font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000"> </font>three year<font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000"> </font>suspension<p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font color="#000000">The most serious of the commingling and conversion charges arose from respondent's represention of Willie Mae Thomas and Sandra Joseph in personal injury litigation.&nbsp; Bank records indicated respondent withheld $1,766 from Ms. Thomas' settlement funds on April 26, 1988 and $3,404 from Ms. Joseph's settlement funds on October 7, 1988, allegedly for amounts owing pursuant to a lien in favor of the Bryant Chiropractic Clinic for the rendering of medical services.&nbsp; Bank records further showed the withheld funds were not placed in trust, and instead were commingled and then converted or diverted</font><font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000"> for respondent's personal use.&nbsp; On December 19, 1988, a complaint was filed with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel by Dr. Virgil Bryant.&nbsp; Subsequently, the clinic retained counsel and obtained a judgment against respondent on June 24, 1993.&nbsp; Five years after the settlement funds were withheld, respondent paid the clinic $5,420, a negotiated amount in satisfaction of the judgment.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000">Prior to the forrmal charges being filed, and after a series of complaints against respondent and a six year investigation by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, respondent petitioned for </font>consent discipline <font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000">on January 3, 1995.&nbsp; The proffered consent discipline would have </font>suspended<font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000"> respondent from the practice of law for a period of </font>30 months,<font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000"> </font>deferring<font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000"> the imposition of the </font>suspension <font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000">conditioned upon a </font>two-year <font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000">period of </font>probation <font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000">during which respondent's trust account would be audited by a certified public accountant semi-annually.&nbsp; Disciplinary counsel concurred in the consent discipline finding mitigating factors outweighed the need for suspension.&nbsp; After a hearing, the disciplinary board issued a written ruling </font>rejecting<font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000"> the </font>consent discipline. <font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000">followed by a three year probationary period wherein respondent's trust account would be audited semiannually by a certified public accountant paid for by respondent.&nbsp; It further recommended that upon ultimate disposition by this court, the respondent personally hand-deliver a copy of the disposition to each of her former clients, proof of which would be by affidavit to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000">The disciplinary board concurred with the hearing committee's findings.&nbsp; However, the board found the recommended sanction was excessive under the facts.&nbsp; In support, the board relied on the existence of several mitigating factors.&nbsp; First, it found that in the two most serious charges, those involving commingling and conversion of funds, the victims were repaid and requested that the charges be dropped.&nbsp; It pointed out that respondent made restitution to the four remaining complainants, although it recognized that restitution was not made for a substantial period of time.&nbsp; Significantly, it found there was </font><font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000"><b>an </b></font><font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000">inordinate delay in the prosecution of the disciplinary charges, since the charges were not filed until approximately five years after the acts took place.&nbsp; Although there were multiple charges, the board found they occurred within a defined period of time when respondent was experiencing economic distress and emotional turmoil by her sister's death.&nbsp; It noted that respondent cooperated by providing a full and free disclosure to disciplinary counsel and allowing the charges to be deemed admitted.&nbsp; Finally, it found respondent has expressed remorse for her misdeeds and, other than the complaints alleged herein, has exhibited good character and reputation.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font color="#000000">Based on these factors, the disciplinary board concluded that a downward deviation in the recommended discipline was appropriate.&nbsp; The disciplinary board recommended a </font>one year suspension,<font color="#000000"> with all but </font>ninety (90) days<font color="#000000"> being </font>deferred,<font color="#000000"> followed by a </font>two year<font color="#000000"> </font>probationary period,<font color="#000000"> during which time the respondent's trust account would be audited semiannually by a certified public accountant at respondent's expense.&nbsp; The disciplinary board further recommended the assessment of costs to respondent.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font color="#000000">Neither disciplinary counsel nor respondent filed objections to the disciplinary</font><font face='Times New Roman' color="#000000"> board's </font><font color="#000000">recommendation in this court.</font></span></p>
