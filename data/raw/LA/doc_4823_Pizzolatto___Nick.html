  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 04-B-1931</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: NICHOLAS PIZZOLATTO, JR.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that
  respondent commingled and converted funds.  Prior to the filing of formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a
  joint petition for consent discipline.  Having reviewed the petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Nicholas Pizzolatto,
  Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 7722, be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of six months. 
  This suspension shall be fully deferred, subject to respondent's successful completion of a two-year period of
  probation governed by the conditions set forth in the petition for consent discipline. Any violation of the
  conditions of probation, or any other misconduct during the probationary period, may be grounds for making the
  deferred suspension executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
