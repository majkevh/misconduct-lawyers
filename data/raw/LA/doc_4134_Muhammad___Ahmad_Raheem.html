<p><span class="BodyText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the incident at issue, the clients hired respondent in 1989 to represent them in a personal injury suit arising out of an automobile accident on a thirty-percent contingency fee from any settlement.&nbsp; On September 20, 1989, respondent received a check in the amount of $2,41 1.70, which he deposited in his account.&nbsp; He received a second check for $3,000 on April 14, 1990, and deposited it in his account.&nbsp; According to the clients, respondent told them he had not reached any settlement agreement and had not received any money on their behalf When the clients later learned that both settlements checks had been issued to and cashed by respondent, he was arrested for theft.</span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondent was convicted on his <i>nolo contenders </i>plea and sentenced to three years supervised probation.</span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Hearing Committee found that respondent had endorsed the clients' names to the settlement checks without authority, thereby converting the funds for his own use.&nbsp; The Committee found several aggravating factors, including: (a) prior disciplinary offenses (three admonitions in the fall of 1990 for failing to provide a response to disciplinary complaints), (b) dishonest or selfish motive, (c) pattern of misconduct, (d) multiple offenses, (e) vulnerability of the victim, and (f) illegal conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, the Committee also found the mitigating factors of. (a) full and free disclosure, (b) remorse, (c) inexperience in the practice of law (five years after admission), (d) imposition of other penalties and sanctions (three-year supervised probation), (e) interim rehabilitation, </span><span class="footnotereference"><font size="1"><sup>1</sup></font></span><font size="2"> a</font>nd (f) delay between the September 1991 conviction (for conduct in 1989 and 1990) and the commencement of disciplinary proceedings on December 2, 1993.&nbsp; While noting that disbarment is the baseline sanction for such conduct, <u>see </u><font color="#008000">Louisiana State Bar Association v. Hinrichs, 486 So.2d</font><font color="#000000"> </font><font color="#008000">116 (La. 1986)</font><font color="#000000"> and the </font><font color="#000000"><u>Standards for Imposing Laywer Sanctions </u></font><font color="#000000">4.11 and 5.11 (1986), the Hearing Committee nevertheless recommended a three-year </font><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">suspension because of the mitigating factors outlined above.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">The Disciplinary Board likewise recommended a suspension of three years.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">In doing so, the Board commented as follows:</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although the baseline sanction for Respondent's conduct is disbarment, the Disciplinary Board is of the opinion, as was the Hearing Committee, that due to the extensive mitigating factors cited above that a three year suspension is the appropriate discipline in this instance.&nbsp; These mitigating factors include Respondent's sincere efforts at rehabilitation, his refreshing candor and contrition, his youth, his meager experience as a lawyer, the imposition of other penalties as well as the delay in disciplinary proceedings </font></span><span class="footnotereference"><font size="1">2</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font><font size="3">After reviewing the record and the findings and recommendations, we adopt the Disciplinary Board's recommended suspension of three years.&nbsp; While the commingling and conversion of a client's funds should generally result in disbarment, we agree that a three-year suspension an appropriate sanction in this </font><font size="2">case.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accordingly, it is ordered that Ahmed R. Muhammad be</font><font size="3"> </font>suspended from the<font size="3"> practice of law for a period of</font> three years, <font size="3">effective November 29, 1993.&nbsp; All </font><font size="3"><b>costs</b></font><font size="3"> of the proceedings are assessed to the respondent.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText">SUSPENSION ORDERED.</span></p>
<p class='footnotetitle'>FOOTNOTES:</p>
<p class='footnote'>1'In 1990, respondent joined the New Nation of Islam. Since that time, he has made restitution to his clients and has performed 100 hours of community service work with Capital Area Legal Services in connection with the conditions of the court-ordered probation arising out of respondent Is criminal charges.&nbsp; Respondent testified that the majority of his time has been spent reforming his character and his conduct and working in non-law related areas. He stated, 'I felt that if I had been suspended by the court, that those were the things they would have ordered me to do. So the minister had me to take it upon myself to do those things for myself, to shut&nbsp; down my practice and start making restitution to the clients, and that's what I've been doing.&quot;</p>
