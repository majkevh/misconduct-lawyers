<p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="headingstyle">NO. 06-B-2657</p>
<p class="headingstyle">IN RE: ANN B. STEINHARDT</p>
<p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This matter stems from a rule to revoke probation filed by the Office of 
Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) against respondent, Ann B. Steinhardt, an attorney 
licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">On September 9, 2004, we suspended respondent from the practice of law for 
three years, with two years deferred, for her conviction of possession of 
marijuana, 
failure to report the conviction to the ODC, and failure to cooperate with the 
ODC in 
its investigation. <span class="cite">In re: Steinhardt, 04-0011 (La. 9/9/04), 
<a href="2004-09-09_2004-0011.htm">883 So. 2d 404</a></span>. We 
also 
placed respondent on probation for a period of two years, during which time we 
ordered respondent to comply with the terms of her recovery agreement with the 
Lawyers Assistance Program (LAP) and with such other conditions as may be 
imposed upon her by the LAP. We concluded that any violation of this condition 
by 
respondent, or the commission of any misconduct during the period of probation, 
&quot;may be grounds for making the deferred portion of the suspension executory or 
imposing other discipline, as appropriate.&quot;</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent&#39;s suspension commenced on October 29, 2004, upon the denial of 
her application for rehearing. Respondent was reinstated to the practice of law 
in 
Louisiana effective November 17, 2005.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On January 25, 2006, the adjudicative committee of the disciplinary board 
appointed New Orleans attorney Philip O. Bergeron to serve as respondent&#39;s 
probation monitor. In April 2006, respondent and Mr. Bergeron executed 
respondent&#39;s probation plan. Among other provisions, the probation plan called 
for 
respondent&#39;s continued compliance with the terms and conditions of her LAP 
agreement, which expires in October 2007.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In May 2006, the ODC received correspondence from Robert Murphy and 
Mark Mahfouz of the New Orleans law firm of Murphy, Rogers, Sloss &amp; Gambel. 
Mr. Murphy and Mr. Mahfouz represented the Treasure Chest Casino in a lawsuit 
filed by respondent in May 2004 (prior to her suspension) on behalf of her 
client, 
Donald Gonzales. Mr. Murphy and Mr. Mahfouz informed the ODC that their firm 
contacted respondent on at least three occasions during late 2004 and early 2005 
regarding Mr. Gonzales&#39; suit. Mr. Murphy and Mr. Mahfouz stated that they were 
unaware of respondent&#39;s suspension from the practice of law when they contacted 
her 
on those occasions.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After this complaint was filed, respondent gave a sworn statement to the ODC 
in which she admitted that she had failed to notify Mr. Murphy and Mr. Mahfouz 
of 
her suspension from the practice of law, as required by Supreme Court Rule XIX, 
§ 
26. However, respondent stated that she mistakenly believed she was not required 
to do so because she considered the Gonzales matter abandoned. Respondent 
explained that she was retained by Mr. Gonzales to file suit against the 
Treasure 
Chest Casino for injuries he allegedly sustained when he was physically accosted 
by 
casino employees and a Kenner policeman. Respondent filed the suit on May 6, 
2004. Two weeks later, respondent contacted Mr. Gonzales to discuss the 
discovery 
requests she had received from Mr. Murphy. Respondent explained to her client 
that 
he was to take the discovery home, answer the questions, and return the 
responses to 
her with certain documentation. Several days later, respondent found the 
discovery 
requests stuffed under her door, unanswered and without the necessary 
documentation. Respondent attempted to telephone Mr. Gonzales but could not 
reach 
him for several days. When she finally spoke to Mr. Gonzales, respondent told 
him 
that the discovery responses were not satisfactory and that he needed to return 
to her 
office; however, he failed to do so. Respondent represented that this was the 
last time 
she heard from Mr. Gonzales. Thereafter, respondent learned that her client was 
a 
drifter, that his contact telephone number belonged to a bar, that no one had 
seen or 
heard from him in weeks, and that he was rumored dead. Based upon this 
information, in August 2004, respondent wrote to Mr. Gonzales in care of his 
sister 
and informed him that she could no longer continue to represent him in the 
Treasure 
Chest Casino case. Respondent also had several conversations with Mr. Murphy&#39;s 
paralegal in 2004 in which she reported the disappearance of her client; both 
sides 
agreed to &quot;doing nothing and letting the matter die on its own.&quot; Subsequently, 
at the 
request of defense counsel, respondent signed a formal motion to dismiss the 
Gonzales case without prejudice. The motion was filed into the court record and 
granted in August 2006.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Rule to Revoke Probation</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">On September 28, 2006, the ODC filed a rule to revoke respondent&#39;s probation, 
on the ground that she had failed to comply with the notice requirements of 
Supreme 
Court Rule XIX, § 26. The ODC prayed for the revocation of respondent&#39;s 
probation 
and the imposition of the previously deferred portion (two years) of 
respondent&#39;s 
original three-year suspension.</p>
<h3>Board Panel Hearing</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">A hearing was conducted before an adjudicative panel of the disciplinary 
board 
on October 26, 2006. The ODC called Mr. Mahfouz, Ms. Susan Passauer, and 
respondent to testify before the board panel. Mr. Mahfouz confirmed that his law 
firm never received any written notice from respondent that she had been 
suspended 
from the practice of law. Mr. Mahfouz also testified that respondent did not 
file a 
formal motion to withdraw as Mr. Gonzales&#39; counsel of record.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Ms. Passauer, a paralegal at Murphy, Rogers, Sloss &amp; Gambel, testified that 
she contacted respondent in October 2004 (prior to the effective date of 
respondent&#39;s 
suspension), and again in April and June 2005 (during the period of respondent&#39;s 
suspension) to inquire about the Gonzales case. Ms. Passauer testified that 
respondent informed her during these conversations that her client had 
disappeared, 
but never indicated she had been suspended from the practice of law.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In her testimony, respondent explained that she had no pending cases at the 
time of her suspension, other than Mr. Gonzales&#39; case, which she did not 
consider as 
&quot;pending&quot; because she had &quot;fired&quot; Mr. Gonzales as a client after not being able 
to 
locate him. Nevertheless, respondent conceded that Mr. Gonzales&#39; lawsuit was 
pending in the 24 Judicial District th Court at the time of her suspension, and 
that she 
failed to notify opposing counsel of her suspension, as required by Supreme 
Court 
Rule XIX, § 26. Respondent also admitted that by failing to comply with Rule 
XIX, 
§ 26, she did not fully comply with the requirements of her suspension order. In 
her 
defense, respondent testified that she was under a great deal of stress as a 
result of her 
suspension, and furthermore, that she erroneously believed that she did not have 
to 
comply with Rule XIX, § 26 because she received a February 14, 2005 letter from 
the ODC which stated that the notice requirement applied only to attorneys 
suspended for 
more than one year.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a></p>
<h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2006-11-06_01-DB-009.htm">Disciplinary 
Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After considering the evidence presented at the hearing, the disciplinary 
board 
found that respondent did not provide notice of her suspension to Mr. Murphy and 
Mr. Mahfouz. During the period of her suspension, respondent spoke to Ms. 
Passauer 
about the Gonzales case on two occasions, which led the paralegal and the 
attorneys 
for the Treasure Chest Casino to believe that respondent continued to represent 
Mr. 
Gonzales. In neither conversation did respondent tell Ms. Passauer that she was 
suspended or that she was no longer representing Mr. Gonzales. The board 
observed 
that informing opposing counsel that one&#39;s client cannot be found is 
insufficient to 
establish that respondent no longer represents the client or that she is 
suspended from 
practicing law.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The board rejected respondent&#39;s contention that she had no obligation to 
notify 
opposing counsel of her suspension because she had fired Mr. Gonzales as a 
client 
in August 2004. Respondent&#39;s subsequent conversations with Ms. Passauer, as well 
as her filing of a motion to dismiss Mr. Gonzales&#39; lawsuit without prejudice in 
August 
2006, belie her belief that her representation of Mr. Gonzales was not ongoing 
during 
her suspension.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Finally, the board found respondent&#39;s argument that she was confused by the 
ODC&#39;s February 14, 2005 letter to be without merit in light of respondent&#39;s 
admission 
that she had read Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 26 and was familiar with it. 
Based on these findings, the board concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>ODC has proven by clear and convincing evidence that 
	Respondent failed to meet the condition precedent of Rule 
	XIX, Section 26(C) necessary for reinstatement to the 
	practice of law. Respondent did not notify the defendant 
	Treasure Chest Casino and its attorneys of her suspension 
	in accordance with Rule XIX, Section 26. Respondent did 
	not notify or attempt to notify her client, Mr. Gonzales, of 
	her suspension in light of her continued representation of 
	him during her suspension.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, the board recommended that respondent&#39;s probation be revoked and 
that 
the two-year deferred suspension be imposed.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on our independent review of the record, we find that respondent failed 
to comply with the requirements of Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 26. It is 
undisputed 
that after respondent was suspended from the practice of law, she failed to 
notify 
opposing counsel in a pending matter of the court&#39;s order.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Nonetheless, we find respondent&#39;s actions were not the product of an evil or 
dishonest motive nor did they cause any actual harm. Under the totality of the 
circumstances, we do not find formal discipline is warranted by this court. See, 
e.g., 
<span class="cite">In re: Hartley, 03-2828 (La. 4/2/04), 
<a href="2004-04-02_2003-2828.htm">869 So. 2d 799</a></span>. Accordingly, we decline to 
revoke respondent&#39;s probation.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">For the reasons assigned, the rule to revoke probation filed by the Office of 
Disciplinary Counsel against Ann B. Steinhardt is denied.</p>
<hr>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1">1</a> This letter is obviously in 
error, as Rule XIX, § 26 provides&nbsp; that its requirements are applicable 
to attorneys who are suspended for more than six months.</p>
