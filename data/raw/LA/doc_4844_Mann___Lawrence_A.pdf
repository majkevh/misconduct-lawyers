  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 04-B-1850</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: LAWRENCE A. MANN</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, Lawrence A. Mann, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana but currently on
  interim suspension.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">During all times pertinent to these proceedings, respondent was a partner in the New Orleans law
  firm of Leake, Andersson &amp; Mann, where his practice was concentrated primarily in the area of insurance defense.
  In 1996 or 1997, respondent and his law firm acquired a new client, ATC Leasing Company ("ATC"), a self-insured
  trucking company headquartered in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The company was referred to the firm by its claims manager,
  Bruce Bennett, with whom respondent has been friends for the last eleven years. In the fall of 2000, Mr. Bennett told
  respondent that he needed assistance and was in fear for his life because his gambling was out of control.
  Respondent's agreement to help Mr. Bennett led to his participation in four separate schemes involving ATC's
  settlement of fraudulent personal injury claims and payment for legal services that were not rendered. These payments
  totaled approximately $96,000, which was shared by respondent with Mr. Bennett and another participant in the scheme,
  all without the knowledge or consent of respondent's law firm or his client, ATC.</p>

  <h3>The Regional Counsel Scheme</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Bennett suggested that respondent become "regional counsel" for ATC, with the understanding
  that checks for attorney's fees would be sent to respondent at his home (bypassing the Leake, Andersson &amp; Mann
  law firm), deposited into his personal bank account, and then "kicked back" to Mr. Bennett. Respondent agreed to this
  scheme, and on Mr. Bennett's instructions, ATC paid respondent a total of $35,000 for serving as "regional counsel."
  While respondent would occasionally offer Mr. Bennett legal advice or perform some services as "regional counsel,"
  the work he performed did not justify the $35,000 in fees paid to him by ATC. From these funds, respondent retained
  between $20,000 and $22,000 to cover any tax liability; he "kicked back" the balance to Mr. Bennett.</p>

  <h3>The Shannon Williams Claim</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In November 2000, Mr. Bennett assigned respondent to investigate and defend the personal injury
  claim of Shannon Williams, stemming from an accident involving an ATC driver. After the file was opened, respondent
  determined that no suit was filed on behalf of Ms. Williams within one year of the date of the accident, and
  accordingly, he informed Mr. Bennett that Ms. Williams' personal injury claim was prescribed and that ATC had no
  exposure under Louisiana law. Nevertheless, Mr. Bennett proposed and respondent agreed to proceed as though Ms.
  Williams had a viable pending tort claim, so as to create an additional source of funds to be paid by ATC and "kicked
  back" to Mr. Bennett. Respondent subsequently "settled" Ms. Williams' fictitious claim for $39,000, created bogus
  correspondence, pleadings, and settlement documents to support the "file," and obtained a "settlement" check from Mr.
  Bennett drawn on the account of ATC. The check was delivered to Fritz Stoller,<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2"
  id="fnref2">2</a> a New Orleans defense attorney whom respondent recruited to act as "counsel" for Ms. Williams. In
  December 2000, Mr. Stoller deposited the check into his "client trust account."</p>

  <h3>The Medical Lienholder Claim</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent successfully settled a legitimate tort claim against ATC for $10,000 less than the
  reserve established by Mr. Bennett. Thereafter, Mr. Bennett proposed and respondent agreed that the excess reserve
  would serve as an additional source of funds to be "kicked back" to Mr. Bennett. Respondent again enlisted Mr.
  Stoller's aid, this time to pose as counsel for a fictitious medical lienholder. On Mr. Bennett's instructions, ATC
  paid the sum of $10,000 to Mr. Stoller through respondent in order to satisfy the "lien." In January 2001, Mr.
  Stoller deposited the check into his "client trust account."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The proceeds of the checks issued by ATC in connection with the Shannon Williams claim and the
  medical lienholder claim were shared by Mr. Bennet, Mr. Stoller, and respondent. Out of the total of $49,000 paid by
  ATC in those matters, Mr. Stoller retained approximately $20,000; he paid the $29,000 balance to respondent, who in
  turn "kicked back" an undetermined amount to Mr. Bennett.</p>

  <h3>The "Girlfriend" Claim</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In January 2001, Mr. Bennett authorized a $12,000 "settlement" of a fictitious claim against ATC.
  Respondent provided Mr. Bennett with the name of his girlfriend to be used as the claimant in the case. Mr. Bennett
  forward the "settlement" check to respondent, who kept approximately $4,000 for himself. Respondent "kicked back" the
  balance to Mr. Bennett.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">These matters, as well as other similar matters involving Mr. Bennett,<a name="fnref3" class="fn"
  href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a> ultimately came to the attention of federal authorities. In January 2002, after
  respondent learned that he was the subject of a federal investigation, he self-reported his misconduct to the ODC. On
  March 4, 2002, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin filed a single count bill of
  information charging respondent with a violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 2314, the interstate transportation of a
  security obtained by fraud.<a name="fnref4" class="fn" href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a> Respondent pleaded guilty to the
  charge, which is a felony under federal law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On September 20, 2002, the district court sentenced respondent to serve five months in a halfway
  house, followed by three years of supervised release, five months of which were to be served in home confinement with
  electronic monitoring. Respondent was ordered to perform a total of 90 hours of community service in lieu of a fine.
  On the day of sentencing, respondent, together with Mr. Stoller, paid $96,275 in restitution to ATC in accordance
  with the plea agreement each entered into with the Government.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On June 19, 2002, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent, alleging that his
  conduct constituted a violation of Rules <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(b)</span> (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on
  the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span>
  (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.
  Respondent answered the formal charges and admitted his misconduct, but requested a hearing in mitigation.</p>

  <h3>Formal Hearing</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">When this matter proceeded to a formal hearing on April 16, 2003, the ODC introduced documentary
  evidence in support of the formal charges, including the bill of information against respondent, the plea agreement
  between respondent and the Government, and the district court's judgment in the criminal case. The ODC also
  introduced the bogus defense file that respondent created in connection with the Shannon Williams scheme, the
  deposition of Mr. Bennett, and the bank records of Mr. Stoller's "client trust account."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent stipulated to the introduction of the ODC's exhibits and introduced the transcript of
  the sentencing hearing in his criminal case. Respondent also introduced testimony concerning his good character and
  reputation in the community. In his own testimony, respondent admitted that his conduct was wrong and "pretty
  stupid," but suggested that he was not trying to enrich himself by agreeing to help Mr. Bennett. Rather, respondent
  testified that his only motivation was concern for his friend, whom he honestly believed "was in danger of some
  bodily harm or problems with his life and he was calling out to me."</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2003-10-14_02-DB-063.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee's findings of fact, based upon the evidence and testimony presented at the
  hearing, include the following:<a name="fnref5" class="fn" href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1. Respondent's conduct in all respects was knowing and intentional.</p>

    <p class="inverted">2. The actual injury caused by respondent's conduct can be quantified at or about $96,000
    ($35,000 in "regional counsel" fees, plus $39,000 for the Williams "settlement," plus $10,000 for the medical
    lienholder "settlement," plus $12,000 for the "settlement" check endorsed by respondent's girlfriend).</p>

    <p class="inverted">3. Respondent's failure to disclose to his client its employee's fraudulent and criminal
    conduct caused ATC Leasing to suffer a total loss at the hands of Bennett amounting to nearly $740,000.</p>

    <p class="inverted">4. Respondent contends that he acted out of concern for the safety of a friend and not out of
    greed. However, respondent does not dispute that he retained a portion of the funds that came through his hands as
    a result of his dealings with Bennett.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these factual findings, the committee concluded that respondent violated Rules
  <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">8.4(b)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span> of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct, as charged in the formal charges.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee determined that respondent violated duties owed to his client, the public, and as a
  professional. Respondent's misconduct was knowing and intentional and caused substantial harm to his client. Under
  the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the baseline sanction for respondent's conduct is disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the committee recognized respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest
  or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">a pattern of misconduct</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the victim</span>, and
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span> (admitted 1981). In mitigation, the
  committee acknowledged the <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">full and free disclosure to the ODC</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">character and
  reputation</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>. The committee found that respondent's payment of
  restitution to ATC was forced or compelled, and thus was neither an aggravating nor a mitigating circumstance.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In light of the seriousness of respondent's conduct, and considering the permanent disbarment
  guidelines set forth in Appendix E to the Rules of Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, the committee recommended that
  respondent be permanently disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an objection to the sanction recommended by the hearing committee, contending
  that permanent disbarment is too harsh and that no more than a three-year suspension should be imposed given the
  mitigating factors present in this case.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-07-21_02-DB-063.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the record, the disciplinary board concurred in the hearing committee's factual
  findings and its application of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<a name="fnref6" class="fn" href="#fn6"
  id="fnref6">6</a> Likewise, the board agreed with the committee that respondent engaged in multiple instances of
  intentional conversion of client funds with substantial harm to the client, and pleaded guilty to serious criminal
  conduct involving misrepresentation, fraud, misappropriation, and theft. Respondent's conduct violated duties owed to
  his client, the public, and as a professional. The board also agreed that disbarment is the baseline sanction for
  respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board adopted the aggravating and mitigating factors found by the committee. In addition, the
  board found the record supports the mitigating factor of the <span class="ABAstandard">imposition of other penalties
  or sanctions</span>, in the form of the sentence imposed in respondent's criminal case.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Turning to the issue of an appropriate sanction, the board rejected respondent's argument that
  the mitigating factors present justify the imposition of a sanction less than permanent disbarment. The board found
  respondent's conduct is serious and fits within <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 1</span> of the permanent
  disbarment guidelines ("repeated or multiple instances of intentional conversion of client funds with substantial
  harm"), as well as <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 6</span> (insurance fraud). The board noted that respondent
  engaged in calculated and dishonest conduct by engaging in multiple instances of intentional conversion of client
  funds, which resulted in substantial harm to his client. Furthermore, respondent participated in a scheme to defraud
  ATC by having the company pay non-existent or non-viable claims for damages. Although ATC was self-insured, the board
  found that "insurance fraud" is a broad concept, and accordingly, determined Guideline 6 is applicable to
  respondent's misconduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on this reasoning, the board recommended respondent be permanently disbarred. The board
  also recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the disciplinary board's
  recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). When the disciplinary proceedings involve an attorney who has been convicted of a crime, the conviction is
  conclusive evidence of guilt and the sole issue presented is whether respondent's crimes warrant discipline, and if
  so, the extent thereof. Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 19(E); <span class="cite">In re: Boudreau, 02-0007 (La. 4/12/02),
  <a href="2002-04-12_2002-0007.htm">815 So. 2d 76</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v.
  Wilkinson, <a href="1990-06-04_1989-2016.htm">562 So. 2d 902</a> (La. 1990)</span>. The discipline to be imposed
  depends on the seriousness of the offense and the extent of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Perez, <a href="1989-10-23_1987-1967.htm">550 So. 2d 188</a> (La.
  1989)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the instant case, respondent stands convicted of one count of the interstate transportation of
  a check obtained by fraud. Respondent's conduct is both criminal and unethical, and clearly warrants serious
  discipline. The only issue that we must resolve is the appropriate sanction to be imposed.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">We recognize that several mitigating factors are supported by the record, including the absence
  of a prior disciplinary record, character and reputation, imposition of other penalties or sanctions, and remorse.
  Respondent has also demonstrated a cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings. Nevertheless, these
  mitigating factors do not diminish either the egregious nature of the conduct at issue or the substantial actual harm
  that results to the integrity of the profession whenever a lawyer is convicted of a serious crime.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent has admitted that he planned and entered into a scheme with Mr. Bennett to obtain
  payment of fraudulent tort claims. Respondent recruited another attorney, Fritz Stoller, to assist in negotiating the
  fraudulent claim checks by posing as counsel for fictitious clients. Respondent also received payment for legal
  services he had purportedly rendered to his client, ATC Leasing Company, when in fact, he had not provided the legal
  services and was not entitled to the payment. Respondent's client lost approximately $96,000 as a direct result of
  the fraudulent schemes perpetrated by respondent and Mr. Bennett. It is particularly disturbing that respondent used
  his skills as an attorney to facilitate the commission and concealment of these schemes, going so far as to
  manufacture a defense file in connection with the "settlement" of the prescribed Shannon Williams claim.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, disbarment is clearly appropriate. However, in their respective
  reports, the hearing committee and the disciplinary board have concluded that respondent's offenses are so egregious
  that he should be permanently prohibited from applying for readmission to the bar.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">We agree. In Appendix E to Supreme Court Rule XIX, we set forth guidelines illustrating the types
  of conduct which might warrant permanent disbarment. While these guidelines are not intended to bind this court in
  its decision-making process, they present useful information concerning the types of conduct we might consider worthy
  of permanent disbarment. For purposes of the instant case, Guidelines 1 and 6 are relevant. Those guidelines
  provide:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>GUIDELINE 1. Repeated or multiple instances of intentional conversion of client funds with substantial harm.</p>

    <p>GUIDELINE 6. Insurance fraud, including but not limited to staged accidents or widespread runner-based
    solicitation.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">While the misconduct at issue here is different from the kinds of conversion typically seen by
  this court, Guideline 1 is nonetheless applicable. Much like the lawyer who pockets his client's settlement funds or
  steals money earmarked for a medical provider, the fraudulent schemes in which respondent participated resulted in a
  conversion of funds to the detriment of his client. Guideline 6 is also implicated, as the undisputed evidence shows
  respondent manufactured fraudulent personal injury claims in an attempt to defraud ATC. This conduct is precisely the
  type of reprehensible conduct we sought to address in Guideline 6.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under the circumstances of this case, the imposition of any sanction less than permanent
  disbarment would require us to ignore the seriousness of respondent's conduct and the grave harm he has visited upon
  his client and the legal profession. We will therefore accept the disciplinary board's recommendation and permanently
  disbar respondent.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that that the name of Lawrence A. Mann, Louisiana Bar Roll number 9096, be
  stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked.
  Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered that respondent be permanently prohibited from
  being readmitted to the practice of law in this state. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against
  respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the
  date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
