  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-1971</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: E. ROLAND CHARLES</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that
  respondent commingled client funds with his own and failed to supervise a non-lawyer employee who embezzled client
  funds. Prior to the filing of formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent
  discipline. Having reviewed the petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that E. Roland Charles,
  Louisiana Bar Roll number 4092, be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of one year and one
  day. This suspension shall be fully deferred, subject to respondent's successful completion of a two-year period of
  supervised probation governed by the conditions set forth in the petition for consent discipline. Any violation of
  the conditions of probation, or any other misconduct during the probationary period, may be grounds for making the
  deferred suspension executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
