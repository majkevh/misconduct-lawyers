  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-0853</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: BOBBY K. PITRE</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, Bobby K. Pitre, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana, but currently
  ineligible to practice.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Since respondent was admitted to the bar in 1985, he has been declared ineligible to practice law
  on numerous occasions between 1992 through the present for failing to pay his bar dues and/or the disciplinary
  assessment and for failing to comply with the mandatory continuing legal education ("MCLE")
  requirements.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a> While ineligible to practice law, respondent
  filed pleadings in the Fourteenth Judicial District Court on fourteen occasions between August 17, 1998 and May 4,
  2000. Specifically, during this time period, respondent filed four petitions for damages; one petition for custody;
  one answer after being appointed to represent the interests of an absentee; one petition to disavow paternity; four
  petitions for divorce; one petition to establish paternity; and two motions.<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2"
  id="fnref2">2</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Furthermore, on October 22, 2001, again while ineligible for failing to comply with his
  professional obligations, respondent filed a writ application in this court on behalf of the plaintiff in Carter v.
  Lin, No. 01-C-2827. Upon determining respondent was ineligible to practice, this court's clerk's office advised
  respondent to take the appropriate steps to become eligible or arrange for other counsel to represent his
  client.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a> Respondent did neither. This court denied the writ
  application on January 4, 2002. On January 17, 2002, respondent filed an application for reconsideration, at which
  time he was still ineligible to practice law.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent. The formal
  charges alleged that respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.1(b)</span> (failure to comply with the minimum requirements of continuing legal
  education), <span class="allegedrules">3.4(c)</span> (knowing disobedience of an obligation under the rules of a
  tribunal), <span class="allegedrules">5.5(a)</span> (engaging in the unauthorized practice of law),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct),
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(b)</span> (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on the lawyer's honesty,
  trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), <span class="allegedrules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving
  dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct
  prejudicial to the administration of justice). The formal charges further alleged that respondent violated Supreme
  Court <span class="allegedrules">Rule XIX, § 8(A)</span>-(F) (disciplinary assessment and attorney registration
  statement requirements and guidelines) and violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, which constitutes a ground for
  discipline under <span class="allegedrules">Rule XIX, § 9(a)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The formal charges were served upon respondent by certified mail.<a name="fnref4" class="fn"
  href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a> Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges. Accordingly, the
  factual allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to
  Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). No formal hearing was held, but the parties were given an opportunity to file
  with the hearing committee written arguments and documentary evidence on the issue of sanctions. Respondent filed
  nothing for the hearing committee's consideration.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-09-22_03-DB-057.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After consideration of the ODC's submission in response to the deemed admitted order, the hearing
  committee found that respondent began running a deficit in his MCLE requirements in 1996, when he earned no hours at
  all. The MCLE hours taken each year thereafter were applied retroactively to satisfy deficits in previous years, but
  were still insufficient. Respondent was ultimately declared MCLE ineligible on August 6, 1998 and did not become
  eligible until October 17, 2000. He was again declared MCLE ineligible on July 26, 2001 and has remained so ever
  since. Respondent continued to practice law during his periods of ineligibility. He also continued to hold himself
  out as an attorney authorized to practice law by virtue of the sign at his office.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on these findings, the committee determined that respondent violated the Rules of
  Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges. The baseline sanction for this conduct is disbarment. The
  committee did not address the aggravating factors present but noted a lack of mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Relying on Guideline 8 of the permanent disbarment guidelines found in Supreme Court Rule XIX,
  Appendix E,<a name="fnref5" class="fn" href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a> and in the interest of protecting the public
  from respondent's "repeated failures to meet his obligations," the committee recommended that respondent be
  permanently disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an objection to the hearing committee's recommendation.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2005-03-23_03-DB-057.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing this matter, the disciplinary board found that respondent violated the Rules of
  Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal charges as well as Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 8(A) and (C)6 and § 9(A).
  Respondent failed to timely pay the required disciplinary assessment on several occasions and failed to submit an
  attorney registration statement. Respondent also failed to comply with the MCLE requirements and was ineligible for
  this reason from August 6, 1998 to October 17, 2000 and from July 26, 2001 to the present. Furthermore, respondent
  ignored a request by the clerk of the Supreme Court to bring his status up to date or to substitute counsel following
  his filing of a writ application. He also continually practiced law during periods of ineligibility.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon these findings, the board determined that respondent knowingly violated duties owed to
  his clients, the public, the legal system, and the profession. He harmed his clients by leading them to believe he
  was eligible to represent them. He violated a duty owed to the public by holding himself out to be a licensed
  attorney eligible to practice law and by accepting new clients. The duty he owed to the legal system was violated
  when he filed pleadings he should not have filed because he was ineligible. Finally, his conduct has shown that he
  has little regard for the profession by his failure to maintain MCLE requirements or pay the required bar dues. The
  record does not reveal any actual harm to respondent's clients, but the potential for serious injury existed.
  According to the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the baseline sanction for this conduct is
  disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the board recognized respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">prior
  disciplinary offenses</span>,<a name="fnref7" class="fn" href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a>
  <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith obstruction of the
  disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the rules or orders of the disciplinary
  agency</span>,<a name="fnref8" class="fn" href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a> and <span class="ABAstandard">substantial
  experience in the practice of law</span> (admitted 1985). The board determined that the record does not support any
  mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Addressing the hearing committee's reliance on Guideline 8 of the permanent disbarment
  guidelines, the board determined that the guideline is reserved for attorneys who have resigned, been suspended, or
  been disbarred. It reasoned that ineligibility is not the same as suspension imposed by a disciplinary agency. As a
  result, the board determined that respondent does not fall within the categories included in Guideline 8.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board recognized that respondent continued to engage in the practice of law notwithstanding
  that various parties notified him of his ineligibility. Respondent was also admonished for similar misconduct but
  filed pleadings for clients on at least fourteen separate occasions. Indeed, in November 2004 respondent wrote a
  letter to the board on his office letterhead stationery. Under these circumstances, and considering this court's
  prior jurisprudence, the board recommended that respondent be disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters fall within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316
  (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. In cases in which the
  lawyer does not answer the formal charges, the factual allegations of those charges are deemed admitted. Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). Thus, the ODC bears no additional burden to prove the factual allegations contained in
  the formal charges after those charges have been deemed admitted. However, the language of § 11(E)(3) does not
  encompass legal conclusions that flow from the factual allegations. If the legal conclusion the ODC seeks to prove
  (i.e., a violation of a specific rule) is not readily apparent from the deemed admitted facts, additional evidence
  may need to be submitted in order to prove the legal conclusions that flow from the admitted factual allegations.
  <span class="cite">In re: Donnan, 01-3058 (La. 1/10/03), <a href="2003-01-10_2001-3058.htm">838 So. 2d
  715</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the deemed admitted facts and other evidence in the record, we find respondent violated
  the Rules of Professional Conduct. The record clearly establishes that respondent represented clients despite his
  ineligibility to practice law as a result of his failure to pay bar dues and/or the disciplinary assessment and to
  fulfill his MCLE requirements. Having found this professional misconduct, the sole issue presented for our
  consideration is the appropriate sanction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain
  high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct.
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La.
  1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses
  involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As a threshold issue, we agree with the disciplinary board's conclusion that Guideline 8 of the
  permanent disbarment guidelines is inapplicable in this case. Guideline 8 provides that a lawyer may be permanently
  disbarred for "engaging in the unauthorized practice of law subsequent to resigning from the Bar Association, or
  during the period of time in which the lawyer is suspended from the practice of law or disbarred." Although
  practicing law while ineligible constitutes the unauthorized practice of law for purposes of Rule
  5.5(a),<a name="fnref9" class="fn" href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a> Guideline 8 focuses on attorneys who have engaged in
  the unauthorized practice of law following resignation, suspension, or disbarment. Because respondent has not
  resigned from the Louisiana State Bar Association, nor has he been suspended or disbarred, it follows that Guideline
  8 is inapplicable here.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <span class="cite">In re: Hardy, 03-0443 (La. 5/2/03), <a href="2003-05-02_2003-0443.htm">848
  So. 2d 511</a>,</span> this court reviewed the applicable jurisprudence relating to cases in which an attorney
  practices law while ineligible to do so. We concluded that prior opinions imposed sanctions ranging from a six-month
  suspension to disbarment:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In cases in which an attorney has engaged in the practice of law while ineligible to do so for failing to pay
    bar dues or failing to comply with the mandatory continuing legal education requirements, this court has imposed
    suspensions to disbarment, with the baseline sanction generally being a one year and one day suspension from the
    practice of law. See <span class="cite">In re: Richard, 00-1418 (La. 8/31/00),
    <a href="2000-09-01_2000-1418.htm">767 So.2d 36</a></span> (disbarment imposed upon an attorney without a prior
    disciplinary record who engaged in the practice of law while ineligible for more than six years);
    <span class="cite">In re: Withers, 99-2951 (La. 11/19/99), <a href="1999-11-19_1999-2951.htm">747 So.2d
    514</a></span> (six-month suspension imposed upon an attorney without a prior disciplinary record who represented a
    client while ineligible, became involved in a "highly improper" relationship with her client, and failed to
    cooperate with the ODC in its investigation); <span class="cite">In re: Grady, 99-0440 (La. 4/9/99),
    <a href="1999-04-09_1999-0440.htm">731 So.2d 878</a></span> (one year and one day suspension imposed upon an
    attorney who failed to terminate a representation after he became ineligible and failed to advise his client of the
    status of her case; numerous aggravating factors present); <span class="cite">In re: Brough, 98-0366 (La. 4/3/98),
    <a href="1998-04-03_1998-0366.htm">709 So.2d 210</a></span> (one year and one day suspension imposed upon an
    attorney who practiced law while ineligible, filed a suit without a good faith basis for doing so, and failed to
    cooperate with the ODC in its investigation; numerous aggravating factors present); <span class="cite">In re:
    Jones, 98-0207 (La. 3/27/98), <a href="1998-03-27_1998-0207.htm">708 So.2d 413</a></span> (one year and one day
    suspension, with six months deferred, imposed upon an attorney who practiced law while ineligible; numerous
    aggravating factors present); and <span class="cite">In re: Geiss, 97-1726 (La. 9/26/97),
    <a href="1997-09-26_1997-1726.htm">701 So.2d 967</a></span> (one year and one day suspension imposed upon an
    attorney who practiced law while ineligible, neglected a legal matter, failed to communicate with his client, and
    failed to refund an unearned fee).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The facts of the instant case support a sanction on the upper end of this range. Unlike cases
  involving a single instance of practicing while ineligible, respondent filed multiple pleadings over a period of
  several years. Most significantly, he continued to practice despite being admonished in 1999 by the disciplinary
  board for practicing while ineligible and after being advised by this court's clerk's office that he was
  ineligible.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">There is no justification for respondent's contumacious refusal to comply with the eligibility
  requirements we impose on all attorneys. Considering respondent's utter disregard for his obligations as a member of
  the bar of this state, we conclude he lacks the fitness to practice law. See <span class="cite">In re: Domm, 04-1194
  (La. 10/8/04), <a href="2004-10-08_2004-1194.htm">883 So. 2d 966</a></span> ("Respondent's long history of failing to
  pay his bar dues and the disciplinary assessment, and of failing to complete his MCLE requirements, demonstrate that
  he has no respect for his obligations as a professional.").</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we find respondent must be disbarred.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Bobby K. Pitre, Louisiana Bar Roll number 17094, be and he hereby is
  disbarred. His name shall be stricken from the roll of attorneys and his license to practice law in the State of
  Louisiana shall be revoked. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with
  Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's
  judgment until paid.</p>
