<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This disciplinary matter arises from a petition for consent discipline filed by respondent, Carmen Madera, prior to the institution of formal charges.&nbsp; The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) concurred in the petition, and the disciplinary board recommended the petition be accepted.</p>
