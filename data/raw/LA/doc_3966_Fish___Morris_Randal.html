<p><font color="#0000AA">SHORTESS, Justice Pro Tempore</font></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Louisiana State Bar Association has instituted&nbsp; disciplinary proceeding against Morris Randal Fish.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No involving&nbsp;&nbsp; one&nbsp;&nbsp; specification&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; misconduct,&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp;&nbsp; sent&nbsp; by registered mail and received </font><font size="3"><u>by</u></font><font size="3"> him on March 1, 1988.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Committee on Professional Responsibility (Committee held&nbsp; a formal investigative hearing on March 14 and 15, Fish failed to appear and was not represented by counsel.&nbsp; Committee, by a unanimous vote, found that Fish had violated the laws of this state relating to the professional conduct of ( lawyers and to the practice of law of sufficient gravity and evidence a lack of moral fitness for the practice of law.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On April 19, 1988, the Committee fi</font>led a Petition Disciplinary Action and the next day an order was signed this court requiring Fish to answer the petition within fifteen days of service.&nbsp; The matter was forwarded to the Sheriff of Travis County, Texas, the county of Fish's last known address.&nbsp; The Sheriff, however, was unable to serve him.&nbsp; The Committee filed a Motion to Appoint A Curator Ad Hoc, and George W. Healy, III, was appointed by this court to represent Fish.&nbsp; Healy filed an answer on November 7, 1988.&nbsp; Hani E. Dehan was later appointed Commissioner and after an extension of time on the Commissioner's motion, a hearing was held on March 10, 1989.&nbsp; Fish appeared and was represented by Mr. Healy.&nbsp; On January 8, 1989, the Commissioner filed his findings with this court and recommended that a public reprimand issue; that Fish be ordered to refund $2,500.00 in unearned legal fees to Mr. Charles Bayne within ninety days of the recommendation becoming final; that proof of such payment be furnished to the Committee; and that upon failing to furnish proof of payment, Fish be suspended from the practice of law until payment is made in full.&nbsp; The Committee concurred with the Commissioner's recommendation of discipline.&nbsp; The matter was set for oral argument before this court on the Committee's motion; however, Fish did not respond, nor did he except to the Commissioner's findings.</span></p>
<p><span class="BodyText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Bar Association has the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that Fish was guilty of the alleged specification of misconduct. </span><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial'>Louisiana State Bar Association v. Dowd, 445 So.2d 723 (La. 1984).&nbsp; </font></span><font face='Times New Roman'>The misconduct alleged is as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in your capacity as Attorney at Law, you were retained to represent the interest of one Mr. Charles Bayne in a matter involving a criminal case.&nbsp; That you were paid a fee in advance in the amount of $5,000.00. That you did fail, neglect, or refuse to provide meaningful services for your client.&nbsp; That you did in fact not complete the representation in the criminal case and have failed, neglected, and refused to account to your client for the $5,000.00 fee paid in advance and have failed, neglected, or refused to refund to your client the unearned portion of the fee paid </font><span class="BodyText">in advance.&nbsp; All of the above in violation of </span>Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.16'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a> (d), and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a> (c) <font face='Times New Roman'>of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the Louisiana State Bar Association.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman'>The evidence taken at the hearings established that Charles Bayne went to Fish and sought legal representation in a criminal matter, as he had been charged with forcible rape.&nbsp; A retainer fee of $5,000.00 was set on August 20, 1986.&nbsp; The retainer was paid in installments, with the final and full payment made on January 8, 1987.&nbsp; Fish did not place the retainer in a trust fund, and none of it was ever refunded to Bayne.&nbsp; Fish made one courtroom appearance, conducted pre-trial discovery, and had laboratory tests done on Bayne's behalf.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the latter part of 1986, Fish experienced various personal problems which resulted in a precipitous loss of weight, marital problems, and a deteriorating financial position due to a decline in his legal practice.&nbsp; He decided to leave the practice of law and in February 1987 moved to </font><font face='Times New Roman'><b>Texas.&nbsp; </b></font><font face='Times New Roman'> Before leaving, Fish made arrangements with S. Patrick Phillips to handle some of his files, including Bayne's.&nbsp; Fish testified that he instructed Bayne to contact Phillips.&nbsp; Bayne denies receiving such instructions.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On or about February 10, 1987, Bayne went to court for a hearing, and when</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> Fish failed to appear, Bayne went to his office only to discover that he had moved to Texas and transferred Bayne's file to Phillips.&nbsp; Bayne then visited Phillips.&nbsp; Phillips testified that when he examined the file, he found it to be extensive and fairly complete.&nbsp; He further stated that Fish had reached an agreement with the District Attorney which would permit Bayne to plead guilty to a reduced charge of second degree battery.&nbsp; Phillips also told Bayne that if he did not accept the plea and the matter proceeded to trial on the charge of forcible rape, an additional fee would be charged.&nbsp; Bayne informed Phillips that he did not want his services and would find other counsel.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bayne then contacted Susan Scott, an attorney who had rented office space with Fish.&nbsp; Scott volunteered to represent Bayne, pro bono, as a favor to Fish.&nbsp; She was joined by Ronald Interbitzin, an established criminal attorney.&nbsp; The record indicates that Scott and Interbitzin diligently performed services for Bayne which culminated in a plea bargain on July 27, 1987.&nbsp; No fees were paid by Bayne to either of them.&nbsp; The plea agreement was similar to the one Fish had arranged earlier.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whether a fee paid in advance of services is classified as belonging to the client or to the attorney depends on the purpose of the payment.&nbsp; A retainer which secures general availability to the client and which is not related to the fee for a particular representation belongs to the attorney and need not be placed in a trust account.&nbsp; On the other hand, an advanced fee for particular services not yet performed constitutes funds of the client which should be placed in a trust account and not withdrawn or withheld without the consent of the client.&nbsp; Lawyers, Manual on Professional Conduct S 45:101 (1984); </font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">Louisiana State Bar Association v. Williams, 512 So.2d 404 (La. 1987).</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the Bar Association proves that the attorney failed to deposit his client's funds in an identifiable bank account, the burden is on the attorney to </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="2">show there was no conversion to his own use. </font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">Louisiana State Bar Association v. Krasnoff, 448 So.2d 1002 (La. 1986); Louisiana State Bar Association v. Williams, supra; Louisiana State Bar v. Alker, 530 So.2d 1138 (La. 1988).</font></span></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fees in this case were for legal services not yet provided and should have been placed in a trust account.&nbsp; Fish admitted that he had converted these funds to his own use.&nbsp; This was a violation of </font>Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next issue is whether Fish, after terminating his representation, took steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect Bayne's interests, such a</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b>s giving</b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="1"><b> </b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="2">reasonable notice of termination, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property, and refunding any advance payment of unearned fees, in compliance with</font> Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.16'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a>(d)<font face='Times New Roman' size="2"> of the Rules of Professional&nbsp; Conduct.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The evidence established that Bayne did not have notice of termination nor time to employ other counsel.&nbsp; He appeared in court on a forcible rape charge and assumed that Fish would be there to represent him.&nbsp; Bayne's testimony also indicates that he did not know that Fish had terminated his legal services.&nbsp; It is unlikely that Bayne would have gone to court unrepresented on such a serious charge had he been informed and been given reasonable notice to obtain new counsel.&nbsp; Fish did not protect his client's interests, as required by </font>Rule <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.16'><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"></span></a>(d)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3">.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Further, according to his own testimony, Fish made no attempt to document or account </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3"><b>for </b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">the work done, nor did he refund any unearned portion of the fee.&nbsp; Fish did provide substantial services to Bayne, as his file contained witness statements, police reports, lab reports, research, and notes on the case.&nbsp; Fish also negotiated a favorable plea bargain that was similar to the plea that Bayne ultimately accepted.&nbsp; The fact remains, however, that Bayne had to seek additional counsel after Fish left the state.&nbsp; It was Scott and Interbitzin who completed the legal work in this case.&nbsp; They completed the file, prepared for trial, and negotiated the final plea bargain accepted by Bayne.</font></p>
<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The purpose of lawyer disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer but rather to maintain appropriate standards of Professional conduct to saf</font><font face='Times New Roman'>eguard the public, to preserve the integrity of the legal Profession, and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp; The discipline to be imposed will&nbsp; depend upon the seriousness of the offense involved and the facts and circumstances of each case.&nbsp; The court will take into account both aggravating and</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="2"> </font><font face='Times New Roman'>mitigating circumstance</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="2">s. </font><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">Louisiana State Bar Association v.

<p><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An official public reprimand is the appropriate disciplinary action for Fish's misconduct in this matter.&nbsp; Since substantial additional legal services were necessary to complete this case, the Commissioner's and Committee's recommendations that half of the $5,000.00 fee paid be returned to Bayne is reasonable</font><span class="footnotereference"><font face='Times New Roman' size="1" color="#008000">.</font></span></p>

</font><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respondent's misconduct appears to warrant a harsher penalty than a public reprimand. </font></span><span class="footnotereference"><font face='Times New Roman' size="1" color="#008000">1</font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"> Nevertheless, the handling of advanced fees for particular services remains an unsettled question at this time. </font><span class="footnotereference"><font face='Times New Roman' size="1" color="#008000">2 </font></span><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">Moreover, respondent performed substantial investigative and research services and negotiated the same plea bargain which was ultimately reached </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000"><b>by </b></font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3" color="#000000">new counsel at no expense to the client, who ultimately suffered no detriment from being foresaken by respondent.&nbsp; I therefore concur in the penalty imposed.</font></p>
<p class='footnotetitle'>FOOTNOTES:</p>

</font><span class="BodyText"><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">I respectfully dissent.&nbsp; The majority inconsistently implies that the respondent wrongfully dealt with his client's money but that he nevertheless earned the entire fee.&nbsp; If Fish did earn the fee, he should have been merely publicly reprimanded.&nbsp; </font></span><span class="Style2"><font face='Arial' size="2">LSBA v.
