<p class="headingstyle">IN RE: CLIFFORD L. WILLIAMS</p>
<p class="headingstyle">ORDER</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On October 1, 1996, respondent was declared ineligible to practice law for 
failure to pay his
bar dues and the disciplinary assessment. Respondent has not been reinstated to 
practice since that
time. Nevertheless, respondent continued to practice law and handled at least 
seventeen civil and
criminal cases during the period of his ineligibility. In 2005, the Office of 
Disciplinary Counsel
("ODC") filed formal charges against respondent arising out of his misconduct. 
Respondent now
seeks to permanently resign from the practice of law in lieu of discipline. The 
ODC has concurred
in respondent's petition.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Having considered the Petition for Voluntary Permanent Resignation from the 
Practice of
Law filed by Clifford Lee Williams, Louisiana Bar Roll number 17398, and the 
concurrence thereto
filed by the ODC,</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the request of Clifford Lee Williams for permanent 
resignation in lieu
of discipline be and is hereby granted, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 
20.1 and Rule 5.5(c)
of the Rules of Professional Conduct, as amended March 24, 2004.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Clifford Lee Williams shall be permanently prohibited
from practicing law in Louisiana or in any other jurisdiction in which he is 
admitted to the practice
of law; shall be permanently prohibited from seeking readmission to the practice 
of law in this state
or in any other jurisdiction in which he is admitted; and shall be permanently 
prohibited from
seeking admission to the practice of law in any jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the proceedings in 07-B-0287 be dismissed as moot.</p>
