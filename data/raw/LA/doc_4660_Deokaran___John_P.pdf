  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: JOHN P. DEOKARAN</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This matter arises from a petition for consent discipline filed by respondent, John P. Deokaran,
  an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana but currently on interim suspension based upon his conviction of a
  serious crime for purposes of Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 19.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>  For his misconduct, respondent proposed that he be permanently disbarred from the practice of
  law.  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") concurred in respondent's petition, and the disciplinary board
  recommended the proposed discipline be accepted.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">From May 1984 until September 1999, respondent was employed by Allstate Insurance Company as a
  "frontline performance expert."  In this capacity, respondent was authorized to issue checks on Allstate's behalf in
  settlement of claims made against homeowner's insurance policies held by Allstate's policyholders.  Between September
  1996 and August 1999, respondent issued 40 settlement checks totaling $564,862.29 to C.S., Inc., C.S. Plumbing &amp;
  Repair, Inc., or C.S. Pipe &amp; Drain, Inc., each of which were fictitious companies that respondent fabricated in
  order to defraud Allstate.  Moreover, the address to which the settlement checks were sent corresponded to a post
  office box rented by respondent.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On November 8, 2001, a Tangipahoa Parish grand jury returned an indictment charging respondent
  with eight counts of money laundering, each a felony, in violation of La. R.S. 14:230(B)(5).<a href="#_ftn2"
  name="_ftnref2" class="fn" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>  On August 20, 2002, respondent pleaded guilty to one count of money
  laundering and was sentenced to serve five years in prison, suspended, and placed on five years probation with the
  special condition that he make full restitution of $434,862.29.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" class="fn"
  id="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <h3>Petition for Consent Discipline</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Prior to the institution of formal charges, respondent filed a petition for consent discipline,
  admitting he was convicted of a serious crime pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 19.  Furthermore, petitioner
  admitted his conduct violated Rules <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct), <span class="Rules">8.4(b)</span> (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on the lawyer's
  honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), and <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct
  involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) of the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct.  For his
  misconduct, respondent proposed that he be permanently disbarred.  The ODC concurred in respondent's petition.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2003-06-02_02-DB-120.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The disciplinary board found that respondent knowingly and intentionally violated duties owed to
  the public, the legal system, and the profession.  Respondent's actions caused serious injury to Allstate and
  adversely affected the public's perception of the legal profession, resulting in actual injury to the profession. 
  The board concluded the baseline sanction for this misconduct is disbarment.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based upon its review of the record, the board determined the following aggravating factors are
  present: <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of
  misconduct</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>.  The mitigating factors present include
  <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">full and free
  disclosure to the disciplinary board and a cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings</span>,
  <span class="ABAstandard">inexperience in the practice of law</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">imposition of
  other penalties or sanctions</span>.  The board noted that respondent's conduct meets
  <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 6</span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" class="fn" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> of the
  permanent disbarment guidelines set forth in Appendix E to the Rules of Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, and
  concluded that permanent disbarment is warranted for the multiple instances of insurance fraud engaged in by
  respondent.  Accordingly, the board recommended the petition for consent discipline be accepted.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Although this matter arises from a petition for consent discipline, Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
  20(B) provides that the extent of discipline to be imposed is subject to review.  In determining an appropriate
  sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect
  the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct.  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana
  State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>.  The
  discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered
  in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.  <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v.
  Whittington</i>, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The parties submit respondent's conduct in this case warrants permanent disbarment. The
  guidelines for permanent disbarment are set forth in Appendix E to Supreme Court Rule XIX.  As the preamble to this
  appendix explains, the guidelines were not intended to bind this court in its decisionmaking, but to provide "useful
  information to the public and to lawyers concerning the types of conduct the Court might consider to be worthy of
  permanent disbarment." </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Guideline 6 of Appendix E provides that permanent disbarment may be warranted when an attorney
  engages in insurance fraud.  That guideline is unquestionably applicable here, as respondent has admitted he
  knowingly and intentionally engaged in fraudulent and deceitful conduct that deprived his former employer, Allstate
  Insurance Company, of more than $500,000.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the petition for consent discipline.  Pursuant to that petition, we
  will permanently disbar respondent from the practice of law in Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Upon review of the petition for consent discipline, the findings and recommendation of the
  disciplinary board, and considering the record filed herein, it is ordered that the name of John P. Deokaran,
  Louisiana Bar Roll number 26261, be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the
  State of Louisiana be revoked.  Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered that respondent be
  permanently prohibited from being readmitted to the practice of law in this state.  All costs and expenses in the
  matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to
  commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
