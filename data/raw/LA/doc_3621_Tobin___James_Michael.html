  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">LOUISIANA ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE:  JAMES MICHAEL TOBIN</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 99-DB-015</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on an admission of the formal charges filed by the Office
  of Disciplinary Counsel (herein "ODC").  The respondent is James Michael Tobin (herein "Respondent") formerly of New
  Orleans, Louisiana.</p>

  <h2><b>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</b></h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">ODC filed formal charges, consisting of three counts, against Respondent on March 11, 1999.  On
  April 12, 1999, Respondent, pro se, answered the formal charges admitting the facts alleged but objecting to the
  severity of the violations ODC charged.  Respondent, now residing in Maryland, requested that this matter be resolved
  without a formal hearing, as he did not have the means to travel to Louisiana and conduct a defense.  On July 2,
  1999, Hearing Committee Number 9 granted ODC's Motion to Submit Matter and the matter was ordered for submission on
  the documents on August 26, 1999.  The Respondent and ODC submitted no further documents.  Hearing Committee Number
  9's report was due October 29, 1999.  The Chairman of Hearing Committee Number 9 was unable to complete the report
  and the matter was transferred to Hearing Committee Number 8 (herein the "Committee") on April 17, 2000.  The
  Committee submitted its report on May 3, 2000.  The Committee unanimously recommended that the Respondent receive an
  admonition for his conduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">ODC objected to the Committee's recommendation of admonition and asserted that the Committee
  failed to take into account certain aggravating factors, such as Respondent's prior discipline record.  The
  Respondent did not file a response to ODC's objection or to the Committee's report.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">A panel of the Board heard this matter June 29, 2000.  ODC was represented by James T. Daly and
  Respondent did not appear.</p>

  <h3>FORMAL CHARGES</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The formal charges consist of three counts arising out of Respondent's failure to mail a copy of
  a pleading to a party pursuant to Respondent's endorsement of the certificate of service.   Respondent has admitted
  the allegations of the counts.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Count I:  Respondent failed to mail a pleading to a counsel of record despite having executed the
  certificate of service indicating that all counsel of record had been served by mail.  Despite a request by the
  Complainant for a copy of the document, Respondent still failed to forward a copy.  ODC avers that Respondent's
  conduct violates Rule <span class="allegedrules">3.3(a)(1)</span><a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" class="fn"
  id="_ednref1">[i]</a>, making a false statement to a tribunal, and Rule
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span><a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn" id="_ednref2">[ii]</a>, conduct
  that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Count II:  Respondent failed to keep the Louisiana State Bar Association informed of his current
  address which delayed the service of the complaint for two years.  ODC asserts that Supreme Court
  <span class="allegedrules">Rule XIX, Section 8(c)</span><a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" class="fn"
  id="_ednref3">[iii]</a> has been violated.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Count III:  Respondent's combined actions constitute a violation of Rule
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span><a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" class="fn" id="_ednref4">[iv]</a>, which is
  the violation or attempted violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2000-05-03_99-DB-015.htm">FINDINGS OF THE HEARING COMMITTEE</a></span></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Committee found that Respondent failed to serve one party in connection with his certificate
  of service attached to a pleading.  The Committee found that this was an isolated, negligent act and that there was
  no indication in the record of harm or injury due to Respondent's conduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Respondent has received two prior disciplinary sanctions<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"
  class="fn" id="_ednref5">[v]</a>.  The Committee rejected ODC's suggestion that the aggravating factors of "pattern
  of misconduct", "multiple offenses", "bad faith" and "substantial experience" under Standard 9.22(c), (d), (e) and
  (i) apply.  The Committee stated this was a single act of negligence by a practitioner whose practice of law spanned
  about only five years and whose prior discipline was unrelated to the instant matter.  Respondent has relocated to
  Maryland and it appeared to the Committee that he is no longer practicing law.  The Committee did find that the
  aggravating factor of prior disciplinary action under Standard 9.22(a) applied.  Neither ODC nor the Committee found
  any mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Committee expressed its concern regarding a public reprimand as the appropriate sanction. 
  The Committee stated its concern that the disciplinary system "must be careful to avoid potential abuse of the system
  by disgruntled litigants; thus, this Committee views complaints lodged by opposing litigation counsel as almost
  presumptively suspect."  Hearing Committee Opinion No. 8, p. 4.  While the Committee underscored the importance of a
  tribunal's procedural rules, it noted that the parties could have more efficiently remedied the complaint of failure
  to mail a pleading.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Committee recognized that Respondent does have obligations to forward pleadings and to update
  his address and that he does have a prior disciplinary record.  Because Respondent may seek to re-enter the practice
  of law, some degree of discipline is warranted.  The Committee recommended an admonition. </p>

  <h3>OBJECTION TO THE HEARING COMMITTEE'S REPORT</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">ODC objects to the Committee's recommendation of admonition and argues that the Committee failed
  to give Respondent's prior discipline record sufficient weight as an aggravating factor.  ODC argues that once formal
  charges have been issued the sanction of admonition is no longer available.  Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section
  10A(5).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">According to ODC, both of Respondent's prior disciplinary actions involved his failure to
  cooperate in the process.  ODC argues that Respondent's failure to serve all counsel of record and failure to file
  his change of address ("even after being reminded by the Office of the Disciplinary Counsel") evidences Respondent's
  disregard for the Rules of Professional Conduct and the disciplinary system.  According to the ODC, the instant
  matter is a continuation of the Respondent's disregard for the disciplinary rules and process.  ODC asserts that a
  public reprimand is the baseline sanction and recommends suspension.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <h3>I.          THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">In as much as the Board is serving in an appellate capacity, the standard of review applied to
  findings of fact is that of "manifest error".  <span class="CITE"><u>Arceneaux v. Domingue</u>, 365 So.2d 1330
  (La.1978)</span>;  <span class="CITE"><u>Rosell v. Esco</u>, 549 So.2d 840 (La. 1989)</span>.  The Board conducts a
  <u>de</u> <u>novo</u> review of the hearing committee's application of the Rules of Professional Conduct. 
  <span class="CITE"><u>In re Hill</u>, <a href="1992-01-22_90-DB-004.htm">90-DB-004</a></span>.</p>

  <h3>II.         THE MANIFEST ERROR INQUIRY</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">ODC did not object to the facts found by the Committee.   The record supports the Committee's
  findings of fact.</p>

  <h3>III.       DE NOVO REVIEW OF THE APPLICATION OF THE RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">After reviewing the record in this matter and considering ODC's brief and oral argument, the
  Board finds the Respondent has violated the following rules:</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">1. Supreme Court <span class="Rules">Rule XIX, Section 8(c)</span> has been violated.  A lawyer
  is required to submit a change of address to the Louisiana State Bar Association within thirty days of the change. 
  Respondent has admitted that he failed to timely change his address with the State Bar Association.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">2. Rule <span class="Rules">3.3(a)(1)</span> has been violated.   The Rule sets forth that "a
  lawyer shall not knowingly:  (1) Make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal".  Respondent admitted
  in his letter dated August 12, 1998, and again on April 9, 1999, "that, if, in fact, I did fail to forward the
  pleading (whatever is [sic] was), it was an administrative oversight for which I apologized".  On its face, a
  certificate of service is a lawyer's pledge that he or she has complied with the service requirements.  Taken as a
  purely technical violation, Respondent violated the Rule.  However, ODC has not demonstrated that Respondent's
  failure to mail a pleading to one party in the case rises to the level of making a false statement of material fact
  to a court.  The record is bare of harm or prejudice to Complainant, Complainant's client, the court, or to any
  aspect of the case.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">3. Rule <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> has been violated.  It is professional misconduct for a
  lawyer to violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do
  so, or to do so through the acts of another.  Rule 3.3(a)(1) and Rule 8.4(d) have been violated which constitutes a
  violation of 8.4(a).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">4. Rule <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> has been violated.   It is professional misconduct for
  a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.  Per his written responses dated
  August 12, 1998, and April 9, 1999, Respondent admitted and apologized for his failure to forward a copy of a
  pleading.  Respondent also admitted that he failed to keep the State Bar apprised of his current mailing address,
  which delayed the ODC's investigation by almost two years.  These two acts have caused prejudice to the
  administration of justice by slowing the process.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C), states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system or to the
    profession;</p>

    <p>(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly or negligently;</p>

    <p>(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p>(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Board finds the Respondent has violated duties owed to the legal system and the profession by
  failing to keep his address current with the Bar, failing to abide by the certificate of service, violating the Rules
  of Professional Conduct and delaying the disciplinary investigation by an obsolete address.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court has stated, " [a]n admonition cannot be imposed after formal charges
  have been issued".  Supreme Court Rules, Section 10A(5).  The Committee relied upon <u>A.B.A. Standards for Imposing
  Lawyer Sanction</u> Standards <span class="ABAstandard">6.14</span> and <span class="ABAstandard">6.24</span> in
  recommending that Respondent be admonished for his conduct.  Respondent has not objected to the Committee's
  findings.  ODC recommended Respondent, at the least, be publicly reprimanded.  In its pre-hearing memorandum, ODC
  suggested that suspension is the appropriate discipline.   ODC relied upon <u>A.B.A. Standards for Imposing Lawyer
  Sanction</u> standards 6.14 and <span class="ABAstandard">6.23</span>.  Neither ODC, the Respondent nor the Committee
  cited any case law.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The penalty for violation of Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 8C (the maintenance of a current
  registration statement) is "a notice of delinquency and imminent certification of ineligibility to practice law".  If
  an attorney fails to comply with the notice by August 31<sup>st</sup>, he is assessed a $25 fine and will be
  "summarily certified ineligible to practice law".   The record is void of information as to whether Respondent was
  assessed and/or paid the $25 fine and was certified ineligible to practice law.  Respondent now resides in Maryland
  and the Committee believes he no longer practices law.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Under <u>A.B.A. Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanction,</u> Standard 6.14 applies to Rule
  3.3(a)(1) which addresses duties owed as a professional.  Standard <span class="ABAstandard">6.14</span> states
  "[a]dmonition is generally appropriate when a lawyer engages in an isolated instance of neglect in determining
  whether submitted statements or documents are false or in failing to disclose material information upon learning of
  its falsity, and causes little or no actual or potential injury to a party, or causes little or no adverse or
  potentially adverse effect on the legal proceeding".  The Committee noted that the record is bare of harm or
  prejudice caused by Respondent's failure to mail a pleading.  In April 1996, Complainant states that he learned of
  the pleading from another counsel of record who received a copy of the pleading.  In Complainant's April 1997 letter
  to the Disciplinary Counsel, he states " Mr. Tobin has still never served me with copies of pleadings he has filed in
  this litigation as I complained of".  Complainant, while he may have been inconvenienced by having to obtain his own
  copy from the court or other counsel of record, never says that he, his client, the court or the case was
  harmed.      </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Under <u>A.B.A. Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanction,</u> Standards
  <span class="ABAstandard">6.23</span> and 6.24 apply to Rule 8.4(d) which applies to duties owed to the legal
  system.  Standard 6.23 provides "[r]eprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer negligently fails to comply with
  a court order or rule, and causes injury or potential injury to a client or other party, or causes interference or
  potential interference with a legal proceeding".  Standard 6.24 permits an admonition for "an isolated instance of
  negligence in complying with a court order or rule, and causes little or no actual or potential injury to a party, or
  causes little or no actual or potential interference with a legal proceeding".</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Respondent has two prior discipline actions.  Respondent was admonished in August 1996, for
  failure to determine his client's objectives, lack of diligence in completing the work, failure to keep his client
  informed and failure to cooperate in the investigation of the complaint. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In November 1996, Respondent was reprimanded primarily for his failure to respond to the charges
  and timely defend himself.  Initially, Respondent was charged with failing to complete the representation of a
  client, act with diligence, promptness or proper communication, provide an accounting and cooperate with the
  disciplinary investigation.  Despite faulty Bar Association records used in sending information to a wrong address,
  eventually, the Respondent did receive notice that his failure to respond would have the effect of the charges being
  deemed admitted.  Respondent did not respond until the briefing period and the Hearing Committee had already signed
  an order providing the counts were deemed admitted.  From the Respondent's brief, the Board noted the difficulty in
  representing the Complainant and commented that Respondent appeared to have more than earned the fee charged. 
  However, the Board recommended Respondent be reprimanded for his failure to timely defend himself of the charges.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">ODC argues that the Committee has not given Respondent's prior history of disregard for the
  disciplinary system proper weight in determining sanctions in the instant matter.  Unlike the prior matters,
  Respondent did respond to the charges in the instant matter and admitted the underlying facts.  The Committee
  determined that Respondent's conduct in this matter is unrelated to the two prior proceedings and is not evidence of
  a pattern of misconduct.  The Committee refused to consider the prior discipline in reaching its recommended sanction
  in this matter.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">A.B.A. Standard <span class="ABAstandard">8.4</span> provides "[a]n admonition is generally not
  an appropriate sanction when a lawyer violated the terms of a prior disciplinary order or when a lawyer has engaged
  in the same or similar misconduct in the past".   The comments indicate that an admonition is appropriate only when
  the act "causes little or no injury to a client, the public, the legal system or the profession and where the lawyer
  is unlikely to engage in further misconduct".  Respondent did not violate a prior disciplinary order or commit the
  same or similar misconduct.  As already mentioned, there is no evidence of harm caused to anyone.  Respondent is no
  longer practicing law in Louisiana, if at all.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">A reprimand under Standard <span class="ABAstandard">8.3</span> is appropriate when the
  respondent violates a prior disciplinary order or has previously been admonished for the same or similar misconduct
  and continues to engage in similar acts that cause injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal
  system or the profession.  The Board finds the Respondent's conduct is an isolated, single event that is not related
  to his prior disciplinary proceedings.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Pursuant to the <u>A.B.A. Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanction,</u> aggravating and mitigating
  factors may be taken into account when determining the sanction.  The Board finds the aggravating factors of
  Standards 9.22(c), (d), (e) and (i) do not apply.  Respondent's conduct does not reflect a "pattern of misconduct" or
  "multiple offenses" because this is a single act of negligence and Respondent's prior discipline is unrelated. 
  Furthermore, the Board does not find bad faith obstruction of the legal system or Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section
  8(C) (the maintenance of a current registration statement).  Instead, the Board believes that Respondent left
  Louisiana and the practice of law and that his failure to update his address was an oversight that was not intended
  to violate court rules.  Respondent's five years of practice did not make him a "substantially experienced"
  attorney.  Like the Committee, the Board recognizes Standard 9.22(a), <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary
  offenses</span>, as the only aggravating factor.  The Board finds no mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Under the A.B.A. Standards, a sanction of suspension in this matter is inappropriate but an
  admonition or reprimand is proper.  A reprimand is the minimum sanction permitted by the Louisiana Supreme Court
  given the fact that formal charges were issued.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">After considering the Hearing Committee's Report, ODC's brief and oral argument and the record,
  the Disciplinary Board finds the Respondent violated Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 8(c), and Rules of Professional
  Conduct 3.3(a)(1), 8.4(a) and (d).  The Disciplinary Board therefore orders the Respondent, James Michael Tobin, be
  issued a public reprimand and assessed all disciplinary costs associated with the disciplinary investigation and
  these disciplinary proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of the
  Ruling until paid.</p>
