<p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) commenced an

Respondent now seeks to permanently resign from the practice of law in lieu of 
discipline. The ODC has concurred in respondent&#39;s petition.</p>

Resignation from the Practice of Law filed by Mel L. Credeur, Louisiana Bar Roll
