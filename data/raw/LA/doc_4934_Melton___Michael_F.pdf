  <p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-0409</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: MICHAEL F. MELTON</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, Michael F. Melton, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana, but currently
  suspended from practice.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On May 30, 2003, we suspended respondent from the practice of law for a period of three years.
  <span class="cite">In re: Melton, 03-0516 (La. 5/30/03), <a href="2003-05-30_2003-0516.htm">848 So. 2d 519</a></span>
  ("Melton I").<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a> Respondent did not apply for a rehearing of
  our judgment; accordingly, the judgment became final and his suspension became effective on June 13, 2003.
  Nevertheless, respondent appeared in court as counsel for the defendant, Clarence Foy, on June 26, 2003, July 10,
  2003, and July 17, 2003, during motion hearings in the matter entitled State v. Foy, No. 436-990 on the docket of the
  Orleans Parish Criminal District Court.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit notified the ODC of respondent's misconduct by correspondence
  dated August 11, 2003. The ODC forwarded a copy of the complaint to respondent by certified mail on August 20, 2003.
  Respondent refused to claim the certified mail, and accordingly, the ODC's investigator personally served respondent
  with a copy of the complaint. Respondent failed to reply to the complaint, necessitating the issuance of a subpoena
  compelling him to appear on October 8, 2003 and answer the complaint under oath. Respondent failed to appear on that
  date.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent, alleging that
  his conduct violated Rules <span class="Rules">5.5(a)</span> (engaging in the unauthorized practice of law),
  <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation), and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) of the Rules of
  Professional Conduct. The formal charges were served upon respondent by certified mail.<a name="fnref2" class="fn"
  href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent did not file an answer to the formal charges, and the factual allegations contained
  therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence. Thereafter, respondent requested to be
  heard in mitigation, and the matter was set for a hearing before the hearing committee for that purpose. Despite
  notice, respondent did not appear at the hearing.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-07-26_04-DB-022.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee determined that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as
  alleged in the formal charges. Respondent appeared in court as counsel for a criminal defendant after his suspension
  in Melton I was final. This conduct may have constituted grounds upon which to overturn the defendant's conviction or
  guilty plea, and was substantially prejudicial to the administration of justice. Respondent also refused to cooperate
  with the ODC in its investigation of this matter. The baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is disbarment.
  The committee found the following aggravating factors are present: <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary
  offenses</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally
  failing to comply with the rules or orders of the disciplinary agency</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">substantial
  experience in the practice of law</span> (admitted 1986), and <span class="ABAstandard">illegal conduct</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The committee found there are no mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Because respondent intentionally engaged in the practice of law at a time when his license was
  suspended and when he knew he was prohibited from practicing, and considering the absence of mitigating
  circumstances, the committee recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2005-02-03_04-DB-022.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board agreed that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as
  charged in the formal charges. The board found that respondent intentionally violated duties owed to the legal system
  and the profession. Respondent's representation of a defendant in a criminal proceeding at a time when he was
  suspended from practicing law could have tainted the proceeding. Actual injury to the disciplinary system is present
  in that the system's resources were unduly depleted because of respondent's failure to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation of this matter.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board adopted the aggravating factors found by the hearing committee, and agreed that no
  mitigating circumstances are present.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board then turned to a discussion of the sanction of permanent disbarment. Respondent's
  conduct fits within <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 8</span> of the permanent disbarment guidelines, which
  provides that permanent disbarment may be warranted for "following notice, engaging in the unauthorized practice of
  law subsequent to resigning from the Bar Association, or during the period of time in which the lawyer is suspended
  from the practice of law or disbarred." Here, respondent received a three-year suspension in Melton I, which became
  final on June 13, 2003. Despite this suspension, respondent appeared in criminal court as counsel for the defendant
  in the Foy case on June 26, 2003, July 10, 2003, and July 17, 2003. Such action clearly shows respondent's disregard
  for his client and for the authority of this court.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Further, <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 9</span> provides that permanent disbarment may be
  considered for instances of serious attorney misconduct which are "preceded by suspension or disbarment for prior
  instances of serious attorney misconduct." Serious attorney misconduct is defined for purposes of the guidelines as
  "any misconduct which results in a suspension of more than one year." Respondent's actions in the instant proceeding
  unquestionably constitute serious attorney misconduct, and were preceded by respondent's three-year suspension in
  2003.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board concluded that respondent's actions in the instant matter, combined with his previous
  misconduct, demonstrate that he should be permanently disbarred. The board also recommended that respondent be
  assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters fall within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316
  (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In cases in which the lawyer does not answer the formal charges, the factual allegations of those
  charges are deemed admitted. Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). Thus, the ODC bears no additional burden to prove
  the factual allegations contained in the formal charges after those charges have been deemed admitted. However, the
  language of § 11(E)(3) does not encompass legal conclusions that flow from the factual allegations. If the legal
  conclusion the ODC seeks to prove (i.e., a violation of a specific rule) is not readily apparent from the deemed
  admitted facts, additional evidence may need to be submitted in order to prove the legal conclusions that flow from
  the admitted factual allegations. <span class="cite">In re: Donnan, 01-3058 (La. 1/10/03),
  <a href="2003-01-10_2001-3058.htm">838 So. 2d 715</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the deemed admitted facts and other evidence in the record, we find respondent violated
  the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged. The undisputed evidence establishes that respondent knowingly practiced
  law after being suspended by this court.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the sole issue presented for our
  consideration is the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct. In determining a sanction, we are mindful that
  disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the
  integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis,
  <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon
  the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and
  mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">It is well settled in the jurisprudence that the unauthorized practice of law by a suspended
  attorney is a serious violation of the professional rules. Disbarment is clearly appropriate for such misconduct.
  However, in their respective reports, the hearing committee and the disciplinary board have concluded that
  respondent's offenses are so egregious that he should be permanently prohibited from applying for readmission to the
  bar.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">We agree. In Appendix E to Supreme Court Rule XIX, we set forth guidelines illustrating the types
  of conduct which might warrant permanent disbarment. While these guidelines are not intended to bind this court in
  its decision-making process, they present useful information concerning the types of conduct we might consider worthy
  of permanent disbarment.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">For purposes of the instant case, Guidelines 8 and 9 are relevant. Those guidelines detail the
  following conduct:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>GUIDELINE 8. Following notice, engaging in the unauthorized practice of law subsequent to resigning from the Bar
    Association, or during the period of time in which the lawyer is suspended from the practice of law or
    disbarred.</p>

    <p>GUIDELINE 9. Instances of serious attorney misconduct or conviction of a serious crime, when the misconduct or
    conviction is preceded by suspension or disbarment for prior instances of serious attorney misconduct or conviction
    of a serious crime. Serious crime is defined in Rule XIX, Section 19. Serious attorney misconduct is defined for
    purposes of these guidelines as any misconduct which results in a suspension of more than one year.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Guideline 8 is clearly applicable to this case, as the undisputed evidence shows that respondent
  represented a defendant in Orleans Parish Criminal District Court on three occasions after we suspended his law
  license in 2003.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Likewise, Guideline 9 is implicated. Respondent's unauthorized practice of law is unquestionably
  serious attorney misconduct and was preceded by his three-year suspension in Melton I for prior instances of serious
  attorney misconduct. In this regard, it is significant that one of the charges for which we disciplined respondent in
  Melton I was practicing law while he was ineligible to do so. Nonetheless, respondent engaged in similar misconduct
  in the days and weeks after his suspension in Melton I became final.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In <span class="cite">In re: Jefferson, 04-0239 (La. 6/18/04),
  <a href="2004-06-18_2004-0239.htm">878 So. 2d 503</a></span>, we addressed a case in which the attorney practiced law
  after he was previously disciplined for the unauthorized practice of law. In concluding the attorney must be
  permanently disbarred, we stated:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Respondent has flouted the authority of this court by practicing law after being prohibited from doing so. In
    the face of this indisputable evidence of a fundamental lack of moral character and fitness, we can conceive of no
    circumstance under which we would ever grant readmission to respondent. Accordingly, he must be permanently
    disbarred.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As in Jefferson, respondent's actions reveal a fundamental lack of moral character and fitness.
  Given these facts, we can conceive of no circumstance under which we would ever grant readmission to respondent.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board's recommendation and impose permanent
  disbarment.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that the name of Michael F. Melton, Louisiana Bar Roll No. 17323, be
  stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be revoked.
  Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered that respondent be permanently prohibited from
  being readmitted to the practice of law in this state. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against
  respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the
  date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> The misconduct at issue in that case
  arose from three separate sets of formal charges, involving neglect of legal matters, failure to communicate with
  clients, failure to account for or refund unearned fees, making false statements to a tribunal, practicing law while
  ineligible to do so, engaging in dishonest and deceitful conduct and conduct prejudicial to the administration of
  justice, and failure to cooperate with the ODC.</p>
