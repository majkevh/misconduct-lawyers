<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This case arises from one count of formal charges 
filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Larry S. 
Bankston.<a href="#fn1"><span style="vertical-align: super">[1]</span></a></p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS </h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">On October 4, 1996, respondent, 
and five other defendants were indicted in the United States District Court for 
the Eastern District of Louisiana. Of the nineteen-count indictment, respondent 
was indicted on five counts of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy and 
interstate communication in aid of racketeering. After trial by jury, respondent 
was convicted on two counts of the superseding indictment.<a href="#fn2"><span style="vertical-align: super">[2]</span></a> 
Essentially, these counts alleged respondent, who was a Louisiana State Senator 
at the time, received a bribe in the form of a “sham” rental of his condominium 
from a person seeking protection of his video poker interests. Following his 
conviction, respondent received a 41-month term of imprisonment and a fine of 
$20,000.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent’s conviction and 
sentence were affirmed on appeal. <span class="CITE"> <i>United States v. Bankston</i>, 182 F.3d 296 
(5th Cir. 1999)</span>. In finding the evidence sufficient to support respondent’s 
conviction, the court stated:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">Larry Bankston contests the sufficiency of the evidence as 
 to his conviction on two counts of violating the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952 
 (1997). The first count involved an interstate telephone call on June 20, 1995, 
 from Fred Goodson to Meyer Realty to set up what was alleged to have been a 
 bribe in the form of a &quot;sham&quot; rental of Bankston and his wife's Gulf Shores 
 condominium. The second involved Fred Goodson's use of an interstate commercial 
 carrier on June 22, 1995, to forward a $1,555.01 check to Meyer Realty as 
 payment for the condominium rental. The essential elements for a Travel Act 
 conviction are:</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p align="justify">(1) travel or use of the mail or any facility in interstate 
  or foreign commerce;<br>
  (2) with the specific intent to promote, manage, establish, or carry on - or 
  distribute the proceeds of - unlawful activity; and<br>
  (3) knowing and willful commission of an act in furtherance of that intent 
  subsequent to the act of travel or use of the mail or facility of interstate 
  or foreign commerce. See United States v. Logan, 949 F.2d 1372, 1380-81 (5th 
  Cir. 1991). Under Louisiana law, an elected official is guilty of public 
  bribery if he accepts anything of apparent present or prospective value with 
  the specific intent to be influenced in&nbsp; his employment, position, or 
  duty. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 14:118 (West Supp. 1999).</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p align="justify">Bankston attacks the sufficiency of the evidence on three 
 separate grounds: (1) insufficient proof that he had the requisite intent to be 
 influenced in his official conduct by the condominium rental; (2) insufficient 
 proof that the condominium rental amounted to anything more than a legal gift; 
 and (3) insufficient proof that he committed an overt act in furtherance of the 
 alleged bribery after the interstate communications at issue. The evidence at 
 trial does not support Bankston's claim. The evidence showed that in February 
 1995 Bankston and his wife discussed establishing an arrangement whereby a 
 proposed &quot;renter&quot; would pay to use their Alabama condominium despite the 
 renter's true intention not to do so. Records from Meyer Realty showed that 
 Fred Goodson rented the Bankstons' condominium and paid for the rental by 
 check. Testimony from FBI agents revealed that the Bankston family, not 
 Goodson, used the condominium during the rental week in question. Finally, the 
 jury heard many intercepted conversations between Bankston and others in which 
 Bankston indicated that he would use the power of his office to protect 
 Goodson's video poker interests during the legislative session. Based upon this 
 evidence, we affirm Bankston's conviction on the two Travel Act counts. 182 
 F.3d at 316.<br>

<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Motion for Interim Suspension</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Shortly after respondent’s 
conviction, the ODC filed a motion for interim suspension pursuant to Supreme 
Court Rule XIX, § <a href="#!-- #ID:r19s19 --#">19</a>. Respondent concurred in 
the motion. On November 19, 1997, this court granted the motion and placed 
respondent on interim suspension. <span class="CITE"> <i>In re Bankston</i>, 97-2628 (La. 11/19/97), 
702 So.
2d 1386</span>.</p>
<h3>Formal Charges </h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed 
one count of formal charges against respondent. The formal charges alleged 
respondent’s federal conviction was a serious crime warranting the imposition of 
discipline.&nbsp; Formal Hearing At the formal hearing, the ODC introduced the 
federal indictment and opinion
of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirming 
respondent’s conviction. The ODC asserted respondent accepted money from an 
individual with
the intent to use the power of his office to protect the individual’s video 
poker interests. The expected benefit was a two year period of protection from 
adverse legislation, which was valued at $1.4 million. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent did not deny his 
conviction, but presented evidence in mitigation.&nbsp; He testified on his own 
behalf, and introduced the testimony of nine witnesses, including judges, former 
law partners and long time friends.&nbsp; </p>
<h3><a href="#!-- ID:97-DB-079.HC --">Recommendation of the Hearing Committee</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee made a 
finding of fact that respondent has been convicted of intentional criminal acts 
that reflect adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer. 
It found his actions reflected adversely on the legal profession and the public 
perception of the legislature.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Citing Standard 5.11 of the <i>ABA 
Standards for Imposing Lawyer Discipline</i>, the committee found the baseline 
sanction for respondent’s misconduct was disbarment. As mitigating factors, the 
committee recognized respondent’s absence 3 of a prior disciplinary record, the 
imposition of other penalties and sanctions (based on respondent’s prison 
sentence) and his good reputation as a lawyer. As aggravating factors, it found 
respondent had a dishonest motive, lacked remorse, refused to recognize his 
wrongdoing, had substantial experience in the practice of law and engaged in 
illegal conduct. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The committee concluded that the 
mitigating factors did not outweigh the aggravating factors and did not justify 
a deviation from the baseline sanction of
disbarment. Accordingly, the committee recommended respondent be disbarred. </p>
<h3><a href="#!-- ID:97-DB-079.BD --">Disciplinary Board Recommendation </a> 
</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In the disciplinary board, 
respondent filed an objection to the hearing committee’s recommendation. 
Respondent contended the hearing committee failed to consider his state of mind 
at the time of the acts, at which time he allegedly believed that he was 
permitted to receive the “gift” and was not engaging in criminal conduct.&nbsp; 
Respondent also pointed out no client was involved or harmed by his acts, and 
there was no economic loss to the governmental entity. Additionally, respondent 
objected to the committee’s finding of lack of remorse as an aggravating factor, 
because he believed he has demonstrated remorse and acceptance of his 
conviction.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on its review of the hearing 
transcript and the documentary evidence, the disciplinary board found no error 
in the factual conclusions of the hearing committee. Likewise, it adopted the 
aggravating and mitigating factors recognized by the committee.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In determining an appropriate 
sanction, the disciplinary board rejected respondent’s argument that his role in 
the bribery scheme for legislative protection of the video poker industry was 
minimal and the value of the “gift” he received (the condominium rental) was 
negligible, thus justifying suspension rather than disbarment. Citing this 
court’s opinion in <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Naccari</i>, 97-1546 (La. 12/19/97),
<a href="#!-- #ID:705%20So.2d%20734 --#">705 So. 2d 734</a>,</span> the board observed that 
an attorney who alleged he had limited involvement in an insurance scheme was 
disbarred even though he was not the master-mind of the scheme. Therefore, the 
board concluded the sanction of disbarment was appropriate.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC 
filed a timely objection in this court to the recommendation of the disciplinary 
board. However, after the time for filing
objections under Supreme Court Rule XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s11 --#">11</a>(G)(1) 
had expired, respondent sought to file a “late” objection. This court denied the 
request, but allowed respondent to file a written brief (without oral argument) 
on the issue of sanctions.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. 
Wilkinson</i>, <a href="#!-- ID:562%20So.2d%20902 --">562 So.2d 902</a> (La. 1990)</span>, this court set forth the considerations 
present in a disciplinary proceeding based on the attorney’s conviction of a 
criminal offense:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p align="justify">In an attorney disciplinary proceeding based on the lawyer's 
 criminal conviction, the issue of his guilt may not be relitigated. Because the 
 lawyer's conviction, whether based on adjudication or guilty plea, is 
 tantamount to a finding of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the 
 clear-and-convincing standard of proof that applies to disciplinary proceedings 
 has already been satisfied. <i>Maryland State Bar Assn. v. Rosenberg</i>, 273 
 Md. 351, 329 A.2d 106 (1974). Thus, due process does not require a second 
 opportunity for the lawyer to refute the criminal charges. <i>Florida Bar v. 
 Lancaster</i>, 448 So.2d 1019 (Fla.1984). A criminal conviction, based on 
 either an adjudication or a plea of guilt, is considered to be conclusive proof 
 that the attorney committed the essential elements of the offense. <i>LSBA v. 
 Frank</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:472%20So.2d%201 --#">472 So.2d 1</a> (La.1985); <i>
 LSBA v. Loridans</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:338%20So.2d%201338 --#">338 So.2d 1338</a> 
 (La. 1976); <i>In re Esposito</i>, 96 N.J. 122, 474 A.2d 254 (1984); See 
 Articles of Incorporation, La. State Bar Assn., Art. XV, § 8(a)(7)(d); ABA 
 Model Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 19(E) (1989). In this 
 type of proceeding the sole issue to be determined is whether the crime 
 warrants discipline and, if so, the extent thereof. <i>Id</i>. A disciplinary 
 proceeding inquires into a lawyer's fitness to practice, not just into whether 
 the alleged misconduct occurred, and therefore matters relevant to aggravation 
 or mitigation of the sanction to be imposed are relevant. <i>LSBA v. Brumfield</i>,
 <a href="#!-- #ID:449%20So.2d%201017 --#">449 So.2d 1017</a> (La. 1984); <i>LSBA 
 v. Frank</i>, supra.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Bodycopy">In the instant case, respondent’s 
conviction conclusively establishes that he accepted a bribe, in the form of a 
sham condominium rental, in exchange for using his legislative office to protect 
an individual holding a video poker license from unfavorable legislation. 
Clearly, this crime is a serious one which reflects upon
respondent’s moral fitness to practice law. Supreme Court Rule XIX, §<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s19 --#">19</a>(B).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The baseline sanction for 
convictions involving bribery is disbarment. <span class="CITE"> <i>In re: Mithun</i>, 00-3174 (La. 
1/5/01), <a href="#!-- #ID:776%20So.2d%20426 --#">776 So. 2d 426</a></span>;
<span class="CITE"> <i>In re: 
Hingle</i>, 98-0774 (La. 9/18/98), <a href="#!-- #ID:717%20So.2d%20636 --#">717

(La. 1985)</span>. Nonetheless, respondent urges us to consider a lesser sanction, 
based on the presence of mitigating facts.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">While we recognize several 
mitigating factors are present in this case, we find respondent’s actions are 
particularly egregious because they occurred while he was a state senator. This 
court has held an attorney occupying a position of public trust is held to even 
a higher standard of conduct than an ordinary attorney. <span class="CITE"> <i>In re Naccari</i>, 
97-1546 (La. 12/19/97), <a href="#!-- #ID:705%20So.2d%20734 --#">705 So.2d 734</a>;</span>

<a href="#!-- #ID:694%20So.2d%20906 --#">694 So. 2d 906</a>.</span> Respondent’s 
highly-publicized conviction caused inestimable harm to the public’s perception 
of the legal profession. Under these circumstances, we cannot deviate from the 
baseline sanction of disbarment.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and 
recommendation of the disciplinary board, and considering the record filed 
herein, it is ordered that the name of Larry S. Bankston be stricken from the 
roll of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana 
be revoked. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent 
in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § <a href="#!-- #ID:r19s10.1 --#">10.1</a>, 
with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this 
court’s judgment until paid.</p>
