<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA<br>
No. 98-B-0291.<br>
IN RE: ADAM SAMUEL COHEN</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class='SupremeCourtCaption'>PER CURIAM. (FN*)</p>
<p><font size="3">*************************************************************************************</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first proceeding involves nine counts of formal charges arising from eight complaints filed with the ODC by former clients of the respondent.&nbsp; The first complaint arises from the respondent's representation of Fabiola Blass, who in November of 1994 retained respondent to institute bankruptcy proceedings on her </font></p>
<p><font size="3">behalf.&nbsp; When Ms. Blass subsequently moved out of state barring the necessity of filing in Louisiana, respondent failed to withdraw from representation in the matter and failed to communicate with Ms. Blass.&nbsp; Nor did he provide an accounting or promptly return the unearned fee and used costs in the amount of $410.00.&nbsp; In February 1996, seven months following the filing of the complaint by Ms. Blass, the unearned fees and costs were returned.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The second complaint arose from respondent's representation of Evie Lenser.&nbsp; In&nbsp; October of 1994, Ms. Lenser retained respondent to handle a community property matter for the sum of $500.00.&nbsp; When respondent failed to perform any of the retained services or communicate with his client, she filed a complaint with the ODC.&nbsp; Respondent later pursued the case and obtained a judgment on his client's behalf;&nbsp; however, he failed to&nbsp; comply with a court order mandating the appointment of a Special Master for final disposition of the community.&nbsp; As a result, Ms. Lenser's case was not completed.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In an unrelated matter, a complaint was instituted against the respondent arising from his representation of Keith Nutton.&nbsp; In July of 1994, respondent was retained and paid $360 by Mr. Nutton to institute a bankruptcy proceeding on his behalf.&nbsp; The respondent failed to file the suit, and misrepresented to his client that he had.&nbsp; Despite repeated requests, the respondent failed to return the unearned fees until seven months after the complaint was filed.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another complaint was filed against respondent by Vera Chandler, who retained the respondent in August of 1994 to file a bankruptcy proceeding on her behalf.&nbsp; The complaint alleged respondent failed to file the suit, failed to communicate and advise of the change in his office address and failed to account for or return the unearned fees and costs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A complaint was filed on August 15, 1995 by Karen Byes alleging she retained respondent to represent her in a domestic matter.&nbsp; Although she paid respondent $225.00 in fees and $221.75 in costs a year before, he failed to perform any legal services, failed to communicate with her and failed to return the </font></p>
<p><font size="3">unearned fee and unused costs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In May of 1995, respondent was retained to institute a bankruptcy proceeding on behalf of David Lee Webster for which respondent was paid $410.00 in fees and costs.&nbsp; Two months later, Mr. Webster advised respondent he did not wish to file the bankruptcy matter.&nbsp; Respondent subsequently failed to communicate with </font></p>
<p><font size="3">his client, failed to account for or return the unearned fee or costs until five months after a complaint was filed by Mr. Webster.&nbsp; The ODC had closed its investigatory file based upon respondent's assertion that he would utilize the Alternative Dispute Arbitration Program of the Louisiana State Bar Association to resolve the matter.&nbsp; Respondent never utilized the program, despite being provided with the necessary documentation.&nbsp; Nor did&nbsp; he returnthe unearned fee or provide an accounting.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In an unrelated matter, Mario Robania retained respondent for $250.00 to review documents to determine whether Mr. Robania had a legal cause of action against a certain financial institution.&nbsp; Subsequently, respondent failed to return the file and original documents, despite his client's many requests.&nbsp; When it was </font></p>
<p><font size="3">later discovered respondent lost the file and the documents, Mr. Robania filed a complaint with the ODC.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, respondent was retained by randy Black, Sr. to file an appellate brief with the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Respondent timely filed the appeal, but later failed to promptly inform his client of the adverse outcome.&nbsp; As a result, Mr. Black was barred from seeking review with this court.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ODC directed numerous requests for information to the respondent regarding the complaints.&nbsp; Respondent failed to reply in a prompt manner, resulting in the issuance of subpoenas compelling his testimony and production of documents.<br>
</font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On October 18, 1996, the ODC filed formal charges alleging violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically,</font><span class="AllRules" field="AllRules"> Rules <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.3'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.4'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.15'></a>, <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.16'></a>(d), <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.1'></a>(b)(c) and <a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE8.4'></a>(a), (d) and (g)<font face='Times New Roman' size="3">. </font><font face='Times New Roman'> </font><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">Respondent failed to respond to the charges and, as a result, they were deemed admitted pursuant to </font><a href='#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s11'><font face='Times New Roman' size="3">).<br>

</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font size="3">The second proceeding involves two counts of formal charges arising from a complaint instituted by Claudia Rockwood, who retained respondent in 1994 to file a bankruptcy proceeding on her behalf.&nbsp; At the time of retention, respondent was paid $260.00 in fees.&nbsp; On August 16, 1996, she filed a complaint alleging respondent failed to file the suit and neglected the matter in its entirety.&nbsp; She also alleged he failed to communicate and advise of the change in location of his office and failed to account for or return the unearned fees and costs, as well as lost her file.<br>
</font>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font size="3">The ODC instituted an investigation into the complaint.&nbsp; When respondent failed to comply with the ODC's requests for information, a subpoena was issued compelling his assistance in the matter.<br>

<p><font size="3">While respondent did not avail himself of the opportunity to submit written argument on the issue of</font> sanctions, the ODC filed a brief maintaining a lengthy suspension was appropriate.&nbsp; <font size="3">No hearing was conducted on the matter.<br>
</font><span class="PlainText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On May 15, 1997, the ODC's Motion to Consolidate the two disciplinary proceedings pending against respondent was granted, and the hearing committee that rendered the eighteen month suspension in </span><span class="CITE">98-B-0292</span><span class="PlainText"> was assigned the formal charges pending in</span><span class="CITE"> 98-B-0291.<br>
</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On June 4, 1997, the committee rendered its findings noting the conduct charged was similar to and occurred contemporaneously with the misconduct set forth in the consolidated proceeding.&nbsp; Further, it recognized the presence of the same aggravating factors.&nbsp; The committee recommended a three month suspension with </p>
<p><font size="3">restitution and the return of the clients' property&nbsp; prior to reinstatement, as well as assessment of costs.&nbsp; It further recommended the three month suspension run consecutive to the eighteen month suspension proposed earlier.&nbsp; Thus, the &quot;consolidated recommendation&quot; to the board was a twenty-one month suspension with restitution and return of client property as conditions to reinstatement.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The board issued its recommendation proposing a three year suspension, with all but twenty-one months deferred, followed by a two year period of unsupervised probation, and two additional hours of continuing legal education in ethics and two additional continuing legal education hours in law office management.&nbsp; As </font></p>
<p><font size="3">conditions to reinstatement, it suggested payment of restitution, return of client property and payment of proceeding costs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither the ODC, nor the respondent, filed an objection to the board's recommendation.<br>
