<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 02-B-0903</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: EDWARD L. HENDERSON</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p><b>PER CURIAM</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from five counts of formal charges 
filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Edward 
L. Henderson, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana, 
but currently suspended by judgment of this court in <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Henderson</i>, 99-3593 
(La. 5/26/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:761%20So.2d%20523 --#">761 So. 2d 523</a></span> (“<i>Henderson I</i>”).<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> </p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<h3>Count I </h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In November 1992, Margaret Mills retained respondent to represent her in a 
wrongful death/medical malpractice case arising out of the stillbirth of her 
child on October 3, 1992. On October 27, 1993, over one year after the alleged 
malpractice occurred, respondent instituted suit on behalf of his client. The 
suit was eventually dismissed on an exception of prescription. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After the suit was dismissed, respondent provided her with a check in the amount 
of $500, which he characterized as an advance payment of a “settlement” in the 
case.<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> Thereafter, respondent delivered a $9,000 check to Ms. Mills. At that 
time, she signed a release presented to her by respondent, which released the 
defendants in the dismissed lawsuit and respondent from any liability for his 
malpractice in the case. Respondent failed to advise Ms. Mills to seek 
independent counsel prior to executing the release. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent’s conduct in this matter violates the following 
provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rule <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.2 --#">1.2</a>(a)</span> (exceeding scope of 
representation), Rule <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.3 --#">1.3</a></span> (neglect of legal matters), Rule

<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.8 --#">1.8</a>(h)</span> 
(making an agreement prospectively limiting lawyer’s malpractice liability), 
Rule <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(a)</span> (violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional 
Conduct), Rule <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(b)</span> (commission of a criminal act adversely reflecting on a 
lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer) and Rule 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(c)</span> 
(engaging in conduct involving deceit, dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation).</p>
<h3>Count II</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">On May 11, 1999, respondent issued a check in the amount of $600 to Dr. Douglas 
Brown for medical services rendered to respondent’s client, James Cooper, in 
connection with a personal injury matter. The check, which was drawn on 
respondent’s client trust account, was returned to Dr. Brown for insufficient 
funds. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Brown reported the matter to the Ouachita Parish 
District Attorney’s Office and to the ODC. Respondent ultimately provided 
restitution to Dr. Brown, but did not do so until six weeks after Dr. Brown 
filed a complaint with the ODC.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges respondent’s actions violate Rule 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(b)</span> (commission of a 
criminal act adversely reflecting on a lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or 
fitness as a lawyer) and Rule <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving deceit, 
dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation).</p>
<h3>Count III</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In connection with its investigation of Dr. Brown’s complaint (which forms the 
basis of Count II), the ODC issued a subpoena to respondent, requesting he 
appear for deposition and produce financial documents. Respondent appeared for 
deposition, but failed to produce the requested documents. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges respondent’s actions violated Rule 3.4(c) (failure to comply 
with tribunal orders), Rule <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.1 --#">8.1</a>(b)</span> (failure to respond to a lawful demand for 
information from a disciplinary authority), Rule <span class="Rules">

<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s9c --#">XIX, § 9(c)</a></span> (knowing 
failure to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority).</p>
<h3>Count IV</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In July 1994, Beatrice Spivey retained respondent to represent her in a personal 
injury matter. Less than one year later, respondent settled the case on behalf 
of Ms. Spivey for $8,200. On March 27, 1995, respondent provided an accounting 
and disbursed $3,224.02 to her. Respondent retained $615.97 of the settlement to 
pay third-party medical providers who rendered services to Ms. Spivey. However, 
respondent failed to pay the third party medical providers, and instead 
commingled and converted the funds to his own use. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">During its investigation of this matter, the ODC issued a subpoena to 
respondent, compelling his appearance for deposition and requesting production 
of certain financial records. While respondent appeared for the deposition, he 
failed to produce the requested documents. At the deposition, respondent agreed 
to produce the financial documents, but subsequently failed to do so. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges respondent’s actions violated Rule 
<span class="Rules">3.4(c)</span> (failure to comply 
with tribunal orders), Rule <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.1 --#">8.1</a>(b)</span> (failure to respond to a lawful demand for

<a href="#!-- #ID:r19s9C --#">XIX, § 9(c)</a></span> (knowing 
failure to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority).</p>
<h3>Count V </h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">On December 2, 1999, respondent registered for a continuing legal education 
program sponsored by the Center of Continuing Professional Development at 
Louisiana State University (“LSU”) Law Center. At that time, respondent tendered 
payment with a check in the amount of $335 drawn on his attorney at law 
account.<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> Subsequently, respondent’s bank dishonored the check due to 
insufficient funds. Between January and April 2000, Glynn P. Pellegrin, Director 
of the Center of Continuing Professional Development at LSU Law Center, made 
numerous formal requests for payment, but to no avail.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On May 3, 2000, Mr. Pellegrin filed a complaint with the ODC. On August 21, 
2000, respondent, through counsel, provided restitution to the LSU Law Center.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges respondent’s actions violate Rule 
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(b)</span> (commission of a 
criminal act adversely reflecting on a lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or 
fitness as a lawyer). </p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed formal charges against respondent. Respondent 
filed an answer to the formal charges. Accordingly, the matter was set for a 
formal hearing before the committee.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-082.HC --#">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">As to the Mills matter, the hearing committee made a finding of fact that 
respondent failed to file suit timely. Based on this finding, it concluded that 
respondent failed to provide competent representation or act with diligence and 
promptness in representing Ms. Mills. However, the committee found no clear and 
convincing evidence that respondent concealed the late filing of the suit from 
Ms. Mills. In support, the committee observed that Ms. Mills had testified at 
the hearing on the exception of prescription. Finally, the committee determined 
that respondent improperly settled his malpractice liability and failed to 
advise Ms. Mills to seek independent counsel.<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In the Brown matter, the committee determined the ODC proved by clear and 
convincing evidence that respondent issued a $600 N.S.F. check to Dr. Brown and 
did not make good on the check until after the matter had been reported to the 
district attorney’s office. The committee also determined respondent failed to 
cooperate in the disciplinary investigation, because he did not produce the 
requested records.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Regarding the Spivey matter, the committee found the ODC proved by clear and 
convincing evidence that respondent failed to disburse funds to third party 
medical providers. However, the committee noted that respondent’s conduct may 
have been more negligent than intentional. In support, it observed because of 
respondent’s incomplete records and inattentiveness to these matters, he may 
have been unaware the third party providers were not paid. The committee further 
found respondent failed to cooperate in the ODC’s investigation of this matter.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As to the final count relating to the LSU matter, the committee recognized that 
respondent testified he believed there were sufficient funds in the account to 
cover the check at the time it was tendered. Nonetheless, it determined the ODC 
proved by clear and convincing evidence that at the time respondent wrote the 
check, there were insufficient funds in his account to cover it. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In addressing sanctions, the committee concluded the baseline sanction for 
respondent’s misconduct was disbarment. As aggravating factors, it recognized 
respondent’s prior discipline, selfish and dishonest motive, pattern of 
misconduct, multiple offenses, obstruction of the disciplinary process, refusal 
to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct, and substantial experience in 
the practice of law (admitted 1981). In mitigation, the committee noted 
respondent’s partial restitution, personal problems (including financial 
hardship), and perhaps the lack of knowledge that the third party medical 
providers had not been paid. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on these factors, the committee recommended that respondent be suspended 
from the practice of law for a period of three years, with the suspension to run 
consecutively to respondent’s earlier suspension in <i>Henderson I</i>. The committee 
further recommended that the third year of the suspension be deferred, subject 
to the conditions that respondent make restitution to the third party health 
care providers, obtain additional continuing legal education, and comply with 
various supervision and reporting requirements.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed an objection to the leniency of the hearing committee’s proposed 
sanction. </p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-082.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board concluded the record supported the factual findings of 
the hearing committee in all respects. However, the disciplinary board 
determined the committee erred as a matter of law in deviating from the baseline 
sanction of disbarment. Given the multiple violations and the numerous 
aggravating factors, the board recommended that respondent be disbarred from the 
practice of law and ordered to make full restitution to the third party medical 
providers.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the 
recommendation of the disciplinary board.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. 
La. Const. art. V, § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an 
independent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has 
been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Quaid</i>, 94 1316 (La. 
11/30/94), <a href="#!-- #ID:646%20So.2d%20343 --#">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; 
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Boutall</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:597%20So.2d%20444 --#">597 So. 2d 444</a> 
(La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in any way by the findings and 
recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held 
the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee’s factual findings. 
See <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Caulfield</i>, 96 1401 (La. 11/25/96), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:683%20So.2d%20714 --#">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; 
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93 
2865 (La. 3/11/94), <a href="#!-- #ID:633%20So.2d%20150 --#">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on our review, we conclude the record supports the committee’s factual 
findings. The record clearly demonstrates that respondent neglected Ms. Mills’ 
legal matter, allowing it to prescribe. Respondent then created a conflict of 
interest by attempting to settle his liability for legal malpractice without 
advising his client to seek the advice of independent counsel prior to entering 
into the settlement. In the Brown and LSU matters, respondent issued checks 
which were subsequently dishonored for insufficient funds, and did not make good 
on the checks in a prompt manner. In the Spivey matter, respondent failed to pay 
third party medical providers from settlement funds as he promised to do, and 
commingled and converted these funds to his own use. Finally, respondent failed 
to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the Brown and Spivey matters. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Having found violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, we now turn to a 
determination of an appropriate sanction for this misconduct. The purpose of 
disciplinary proceedings is not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to 
maintain the appropriate standards of professional conduct, to preserve the 
integrity of the legal profession and to deter other lawyers from engaging in 
violations of the standards of the profession. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Vaughan</i>, 00 1892 (La. 
10/27/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:772%20So.2d%2087 --#">772 So. 2d 87</a></span>; 
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Lain</i>, 00 0148 (La. 5/26/00), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:760%20So.2d%201152 --#">760 So. 2d 1152</a></span>; 
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Levy</i>, 
<a href="#!-- #ID:400%20So.2d%201355 --#">400 So. 2d 1355</a> (La. 1981)</span>. The discipline to 
be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the 
offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Redd</i>, 95 1472 (La. 9/15/95), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:660%20So.2d%20839 --#">660 So. 2d 839</a></span>; 
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana 
State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent’s misconduct is serious in nature and has caused actual harm. He 
deprived Ms. Mills of the opportunity to determine whether his offer to settle 
his legal malpractice liability was adequate under the facts. By failing to 
disburse funds to the third party medical providers, he has deprived these 
providers of their funds for an extended period of time. Respondent’s issuance 
of dishonored checks in the Brown and LSU matters required Dr. Brown and LSU to 
undergo the additional time and expense to obtain their money. His failure to 
cooperate with the ODC resulted in the delay of these proceedings, and required 
the ODC to expend additional resources and time. Given the actual harm visited 
by respondent on both clients and third parties in this case, the baseline 
sanction is unquestionably disbarment. See, e.g., <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Gros</i>, 97-1295 (La. 
9/24/97), <a href="#!-- #ID:699%20So.2d%20384 --#">699 So. 2d 384</a></span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, we recognize respondent’s prior discipline in 
<i>Henderson 
I</i>, his substantial experience in the practice of law, a pattern of misconduct 
and multiple offenses. We are unable to find any mitigating factors from the 
record.<a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> Under these facts, we see no basis to deviate from the baseline 
sanction of disbarment. Accordingly, we will disbar respondent from the practice 
of law in the State of Louisiana.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and 
disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is the decision of this court 
that the recommendation of the disciplinary board be accepted. Accordingly, it 
is ordered that the name of Edward L. Henderson be stricken from the roll of 
attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be 
revoked. Respondent is ordered to provide restitution to his victims. All costs 
and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with 
Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from 
the date of finality of this court’s judgment until paid.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<hr noshade="" color="#000000" align="left" width="100" size="1">
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> In <i>Henderson I</i>, respondent was suspended from the practice of law for 
a period of eighteen months for failing to maintain settlement funds in a trust 
account, failing to remit payment to a third-party health care provider, failing 
to cooperate in a disciplinary matter and commingling and conversion of client 
funds. Respondent has not sought reinstatement from that suspension.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> This check was returned by the bank for insufficient funds. Respondent 
ultimately made good on the check, after Ms. Mills notified the Winn Parish 
District Attorney’s Office regarding the matter.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> While the record makes reference to respondent’s “attorney at law account,” it 
appears to have been utilized as his operating account, although it is not 
specifically designated as such.</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> Respondent testified that in connection with the underlying suit in the Mills 
matter, a representative of an insurer informed him that the insurer was willing 
to settle the case for $10,000 as “nuisance value.” Therefore, respondent 
testified he considered the $9,000 as an “advance” on this settlement, with the 
understanding that it would be respondent’s loss if he were unable to get the 
money back from the insurer. The committee also heard testimony from the 
attorney who represented the defendant physician. That attorney testified no 
offer of settlement was ever made. In light of this testimony, the committee 
found respondent’s testimony was “at best inconsistent and at worst, 
intentionally misleading.”</p>

<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5">5</a> While the committee found partial restitution as a mitigating factor, we note 
that restitution was not paid until after the affected parties filed 
disciplinary complaints or sought assistance from the district attorney. 
Likewise, we find no evidence in the record (other than respondent’s 
self-serving statements) to support his claim of personal problems.</p>
