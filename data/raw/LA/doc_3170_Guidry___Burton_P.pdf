  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: BURTON P. GUIDRY</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 99-DB-098</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE"><b>RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</b></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary matter based on the filing of formal charges by the Office of Disciplinary
  Counsel ("ODC") against the respondent, Burton P. Guidry, of Slaughter, Louisiana ("Respondent").</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On October 4, 1999, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel filed formal charges against Respondent.
  Pursuant to Rule XIX, Section 13(A), Respondent was served with the formal charges on October 13, 1999, as evidenced
  by the Domestic Return Receipt in the file. According to Rule XIX, Section 8(C), service pursuant to Section 13(A)
  constitutes adequate notice for purposes of the disciplinary rules.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent failed to answer the charges and the hearing committee chair, Christopher H. Riviere,
  ordered the factual allegations contained the formal charges deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing
  evidence on November 24, 1999. In the same order, the parties were given until January 14, 2000, to file written
  arguments and documentary evidence on the issue of sanctions.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC filed its deemed admitted submission on sanctions and urged that Respondent be publicly
  reprimanded. Hearing Committee Number Twenty-Five (herein "Committee") filed its report on July 10, 2000, and
  recommended that Respondent be publicly reprimanded.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Oral argument before the Disciplinary Board was held on August 31, 2000. Deputy Disciplinary
  Counsel Mimi T. Nguyen appeared on behalf of ODC; Respondent did not appear.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was charged with one count involving the improper classification of an hourly fee
  deposit as a retainer, improper handling and commingling of funds, and inadequate and inaccurate accounting to
  complainants that resulted in the wrong amount being refunded to the clients. Agnes Mincin, Charles Simmons and Doris
  Dunlap, brother and sisters, engaged Respondent's services in October 1995 to interdict their seventy-eight-year-old
  sister, Louise Sibley, and to nullify a donation and lease. Mincin and Simmons filed a complaint with ODC on June 24,
  1998. Dunlap did not join the complaint.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Prior to the formal charges, Respondent answered the complaint, submitted several years of trust
  account bank statements, submitted the clients' file, and appeared before ODC and gave a sworn statement on December
  4,1998. In his statement, he admitted that because of $500 he did not know that he had received from his clients, he
  did owe the clients a refund of $372.75. Before the complaint was filed, Respondent refunded the balance of their
  account in escrow, $816.25 to Mincin and Dunlap on April 20, 1998. As of December 4, this refund check had not been
  negotiated.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC charged Respondent with violating Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.5(f)(3)</span><a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" class="fn" id="_ednref1">[i]</a> ,
  <span class="allegedrules">1.15(a)</span>(b) and (c)<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn"
  id="_ednref2">[ii]</a> , <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span><a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" class="fn"
  id="_ednref3">[iii]</a> and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> and (c)<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"
  class="fn" id="_ednref4">[iv]</a> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. ODC recommended in its submission on
  sanctions to the Committee that Respondent's conduct was negligent and caused injury or potential injury to his
  clients. ODC suggested that the A.B.A. <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> (herein "Standard") Standard
  4.13 provided the appropriate baseline sanction of public reprimand. ODC identified the following aggravating
  factors: prior disciplinary offenses<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" class="fn" id="_ednref5">[v]</a> (9.22(a)), a
  pattern of misconduct (9.22(c)) and substantial experience in the practice of law (9.22(i)).</p>

  <h2><span class="cite"><a   href="../HC/2000-07-10_99-DB-098.htm">THE HEARING COMMITTEE'S
  REPORT</a></span></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Committee found that based upon the deemed admitted rule and supporting documentation that
  ODC had proven the necessary facts by clear and convincing evidence to support Respondent's violation of Rules
  1.5(f)(3), 1.15(a)(b) and (c), 1.16(d) and 8.4(a) and (c). The Committee found that Respondent's sworn statement
  supported the finding that the "contract inappropriately classified the clients' hourly-fee deposit as a retainer."
  HC Report p. 1, <i>citing,</i> ODC Exhibit D, pp. 32-35. After the termination of his services (April 8, 1998),
  Respondent failed to give a proper accounting to Mincin and Simmons and caused him to refund an insufficient amount
  to his clients. The Committee further found that based upon Respondent's admissions, he owed Mincin and Simmons an
  additional $372.75. HC Report p.1, <i>citing,</i> ODC Exhibit D, p. 41. In Respondent's sworn statement, ODC
  suggested to Respondent that he make the refund check to Mincin and Dunlap.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the formal charges, ODC alleged that Respondent had "failed to properly deposit and handle
  said hourly fee deposit and inappropriately commingled funds." ODC Formal Charges p. 1. The Committee did not make
  any factual findings as to this allegation of misconduct but did find that Respondent had violated Rule
  1.5(f)(3).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Committee relied upon Standard 4.13 which states "reprimand is generally appropriate when a
  lawyer is negligent in dealing with client property and causes injury or potential injury to a client." The Committee
  found the baseline sanction was public reprimand and recommended that a public reprimand be issued to Respondent.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <h3>I. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The powers and duties of the Disciplinary Board are defined in Section 2 of the Louisiana Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement. Subsection (G) (2)(a) states that the Board is "to perform
  appellate review functions, consisting of review of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of
  hearing committees with respect to formal charges. . . and prepare and forward to the court its own findings, if any,
  and recommendations."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Inasmuch as the Board is serving in an appellate capacity, the standard of review applied to
  findings of fact is that of "manifest error." <i>Arceneaux v. Domingue</i>, 365 So. 2d 1330 (La. 1978); <i>Rosell v.
  Esco</i>, 549 So. 2d 840 (La. 1989). The Board conducts a <i>de novo</i> review of the hearing committee's
  application of the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct. <span class="cite"><i>In re Hill</i>,
  <a href="1992-01-22_90-DB-004.htm">90-DB-004</a></span>.</p>

  <h3>II. THE MANIFEST ERROR INQUIRY</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court has approved of the Disciplinary Board's application of the manifest
  error standard in its review of the Committee's factual findings. <span class="cite"><i>In re Caulfield</i>, No.
  96-1401, p. 4 (La. 11/25/96); <a href="../SC/1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>, 717; <i>citing,</i>
  <span class="cite"><i>In re Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La.3/11/94), <a href="../SC/1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d
  150</a></span>. "In civil cases, the appropriate standard for appellate review of factual determinations is the
  manifest error-clearly wrong standard which precludes the setting aside of a trial court or jury's finding of fact
  unless those findings are clearly wrong in light of the record reviewed in its entirety." <i>Caulfield</i>, No.
  96-1401, p. 4; 683 So. 2d 714, 717; <i>citing, Alexander v. Pellerin Marble &amp; Granite,</i> 93-1698 (La.1/14/94),
  630 So. 2d 706; <i>Rosell v. Esco</i>, 549 So. 2d 840 (La.1989).</p>

  <h4>A. The Evidence Does Not Prove The Improper Classification Of An Hourly Fee Deposit As </h4>

  <p class="Bodycopy"><b>A Retainer</b></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC charged and the Committee found "the improper classification of an hourly fee deposit as a
  retainer." ODC did not submit and the Committee did not review the retainer agreement between the Respondent and his
  clients. The Board notes that in some situations a retainer may be exhausted by hourly charges against it. In fact,
  that is what was done here based upon the Respondent's testimony. <i>See</i> Exhibit 1, p. 31, ln. 24 and p. 32, ln.
  19-22. The Committee cited pages 32-35 of Exhibit 1 to support its finding of the improper classification of the
  deposit. Pages 32-35 reflect a possible failure to place the monies received from the clients in Respondent's trust
  account and the Respondent's error in describing the retainer as "non-refundable," but do not support a finding of
  the improper classification of the deposit. In the context of the instant matter, it is not clear what is meant by
  the allegation and finding of "the improper classification of an hourly fee deposit as a retainer." The deemed
  admitted rule does not relieve ODC of its responsibility to prove a <i>prima facie</i> case by competent evidence and
  the Board is not relieved of its obligation to ensure that ODC's burden of proof was satisfied.
  <span class="cite"><i>In re Bishop</i>, <a href="0000-00-00_90-DB-027.htm">90-DB-027</a></span>;
  <span class="cite"><i>In re Crittenden</i>, <a href="1995-08-09_94-DB-001.htm">94-DB-001</a></span>;
  <span class="cite"><i>In re Elloie</i>, <a href="1996-01-10_94-DB-016.htm">94-DB-016</a></span>. The Committee's
  finding is clearly wrong in light of the record reviewed as a whole and the absence of the retainer agreement for an
  independent review.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"><b>B. The Evidence Does Not Prove The Improper Handling And Commingling Of Funds</b></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">ODC offered the Respondent's sworn statement to prove the allegation of improper handling and
  commingling of funds. The Committee made no factual findings as to the allegation but found a rule violation of
  1.5(f)(3). In the sworn statement, Respondent asserted that based upon the retainer agreement he was justified in
  placing the money directly into the operating account. Pursuant to Rule 1.5(f)(2),<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6"
  class="fn" id="_ednref6">[vi]</a> in certain cases where the client pays all or part of a fixed fee for particular
  services to be rendered in the future, the funds become the property of the lawyer and may be deposited into the
  operating accounting.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Of the money received, Respondent testified that $1,000 was placed in the trust account for costs
  and expenses. Further, Respondent stated that it was their agreement to handle the two cases for $2,000 each.
  <i>See</i> Exhibit 1, p. 31, ln. 20 thru p. 33, ln. 22. There is no evidence that Respondent billed the clients above
  the money he was paid or that he intended to bill them when the retainer was exhausted. The retainer agreement was
  not submitted to the Committee and is not available for the Panel's independent review. There is no clear and
  convincing evidence in the record to support the allegation of improper handling and commingling. The Committee's
  findings are clearly wrong based upon the Respondent's sworn statement and the lack of any other evidence.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"><b>C. ODC Did Prove By Clear And Convincing Evidence That Respondent Gave An Inadequate and
  Inaccurate Accounting</b></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Respondent admits in his sworn statement that he was wrong about the amount of money he
  actually received from the clients. Resp. Sworn Statement p. 8, ln. 2-21, and p. 35, ln.1-12. Respondent could not
  account for his apparent receipt of $500 from the clients based upon his office accounting records. Respondent had
  refunded $816.25 to the clients approximately two months prior to the complaint. However, it was not until he was
  preparing for his sworn statement that he realized he did receive $500 more than he thought and, as a consequence, he
  owed the clients an additional $372.75. Resp. Sworn Statement p. 8, ln. 8-21, and p. 41, ln. 12 thru p. 42, ln. 1.
  These admissions provide clear and convincing evidence that Respondent gave an inadequate and inaccurate accounting,
  which resulted in the wrong amount being refunded to the clients.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"><b>D. Conclusion</b></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board finds that the Committee's factual finding are manifestly erroneous in part and are not
  manifestly erroneous in part, as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">1. That the allegation of "the improper classification of an hourly fee deposit as a retainer"
    is manifestly erroneous;</p>

    <p class="inverted">2. That the allegation of improper handling and commingling of funds is manifestly erroneous;
    and</p>

    <p class="inverted">3. That the allegation of inadequate and inaccurate accounting, which resulted in the wrong
    amount being refunded to the clients, is <u>not</u> manifestly erroneous.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>III. DE NOVO REVIEW OF THE APPLICATION OF THE RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the record in this matter, the Board makes the following findings concerning the
  Committee's determination of violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">A.   Rule 1.5(f)(3) does not appear to have been violated. It is professional misconduct for a
    lawyer not to place an advance deposit in a trust account for fees, which are to accrue at an hourly rate. In light
    of Respondent's sworn statement and rule 1.5(f)(2), ODC has not proven by clear and convincing evidence
    Respondent's violation of Rule 1.5(f)(3).</p>

    <p class="inverted">B.   Rule 1.15(a), failure to keep complete records of clients' funds, and Rule 1.16(d),
    failure to refund unearned fees, appears to have been violated. Based upon Respondent's own records and his
    admission, he failed to accurately record the amount paid to him, which caused him to owe an additional refund of
    $372.75 to his clients. ODC has proven by clear and convincing evidence the violation of Rules 1.15(a) and
    1.16(d).</p>

    <p class="inverted">C.   Rules 1.15(b) and (c) do not appear to have been violated.<br />
    <br />
     Rule 1.15 (b) refers to funds received by the lawyer from sources other than the client and in which the client
    may have an interest. In the instant matter, there is no testimony or evidence that Respondent received funds from
    any source other than from his clients. The record does not support a violation of 1.15 (b) by clear and convincing
    evidence.<br />
    <br />
     Rule 1.15 (c) requires a lawyer to keep property, in which he and the client both claim an interest, separate from
    the lawyer's property until there is an accounting and severance of their interests. The only information regarding
    this violation was Respondent's sworn statement. The sworn statement merely points out a disagreement between
    Respondent and ODC about whether all the money should have been placed in the trust account. Respondent testified
    that the money, except for the $1,000 placed in trust, was the predetermined amount to handle the two legal
    matters. ODC did not prove by the sworn statement, the retainer agreement or any other means that the clients
    maintained an ownership interest in the money after it paid to Respondent.<br />
    <br />
     Rule 1.15 (c) also requires any portion of property in dispute shall be kept separate until the dispute is
    resolved. ODC did not prove that Respondent failed to place money in dispute in a separate account until there was
    an accounting and severance of interests. Complainants did not state in their complaint any specific amount or
    range of money that was in dispute. Instead, the Complainants alleged that Respondent took too long, did not
    communicate with them and charged too much money for the work he performed. Respondent had already refunded $816.25
    prior to the lodging of the complaint. It was not until the Respondent received ODC's subpoena (one and one-half
    days prior to the day set for his appearance for his sworn statement) that he determined the clients were owed an
    additional $372.75 due to his oversight of an additional $500 paid by the clients. Resp. Sworn Statement p. 6, ln.
    9-22; p. 38, ln. 13-21; p. 41, ln.12 thru p. 42, ln.1. According to the sworn statement, Respondent was to
    immediately mail the $372.75 refund to Mincin and Dunlap. Resp. Sworn Statement p. 39, ln. 17-25. Respondent's
    sworn statement and ODC's documentation do not support by clear and convincing evidence a violation of Rule 1.15
    (b) or (c).</p>

    <p class="inverted">D.   Rule 8.4(a), violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, appears to have been violated
    based on Respondent's violation of Rules 1.15(a) and 1.16(d). ODC has proven by clear and convincing evidence a
    violation of 8.4(a).</p>

    <p class="inverted">E.    Rule 8.4(c), conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation, does not
    appear to have been violated. The record supports only Respondent's negligence in failing to keep accurate
    accounting records and provide an adequate accounting to his clients. ODC has not proven by clear and convincing
    evidence that Respondent engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon the facts and violations proven by the record, Respondent has violated a duty owed to
  his clients to provide an accurate and adequate accounting accompanied with an accurate refund to his clients.
  Respondent's actions in this regard were negligent. The Board adopts the hearing committee's finding of the
  aggravating factors of <span class="ABAstandard">prior discipline</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of
  misconduct</span>, and <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span>. <i>See</i>
  <i>A.B.A. Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, Standard 9.2.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> to
  determine the baseline sanction by "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's mental state and the extent of the injury
  caused; and then adjust the sanction in accordance with the aggravating and mitigating factors present."
  <span class="cite"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94); <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d
  343</a>, 350</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The proposed sanction is in line with the ABA guidelines. Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.13</span> states a reprimand is appropriate "when a lawyer is negligent in dealing with
  client property and causes injury or potential injury to a client." The commentary suggests that a reprimand is
  appropriate when a lawyer fails to follow his established procedures or is negligent in supervising and training his
  office staff in monitoring a client's account. Under the A.B.A. Standards, a public reprimand is appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, the Disciplinary Board recommends the issuance of a public reprimand based upon a
  violation of Rules 1.15(a), 1.16(d), and 8.4(a).</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, the Disciplinary Board rejects the portion of the Committee's report
  relevant to a violation of Rules 1.5(f)(3), 1.15(b)(c) and 8.4(c). The Board adopts the portion of the Committee's
  report relevant to a violation Rules <span class="Rules">1.15(a)</span>, <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span> and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span>, as well as the Committee's recommended sanction. The Board further orders that the
  Respondent, Burton P. Guidry, be issued a public reprimand and that he be assessed with all costs and expenses of
  these proceedings.</p>

    <h2>CONCURRENCE</h2>

    <p class="Bodycopy">  The record does not reflect whether or not Respondent was served with the deemed admitted
    order. However, the H.C. report was served on Respondent and it made no finding of fact that is not contained in
    Respondent's response to Office of Disciplinary Counsel's inquiries prior to formal charges. Respondent has
    steadfastly ignored the disciplinary process after his first, rather extensive, response to the complaint. While I
    urge strict conformity with, and proof of, all notice requirements, Respondent does not seem to have been
    prejudiced. He was notified of the Board hearing but did not appear.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">I admit to being troubled by Respondent's history of prior discipline (six times), and also by
    Respondent's apparent cavalier attitude toward the disciplinary process. However, his initial response before
    charges were filed seems to have been complete, and he had made an accounting and refund to his clients,
    <u>before</u> the complaint was filed. Further, he discovered an error in that refund and made the further refund
    voluntarily.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">I can support finding a violation of Rules 1.15(a) and 1.16(d), but believe it was minimal and
    in good faith. I do not concur in finding a violation of Rule 8.4(a). It adds nothing to say that violation of
    Rules 1.15(a) and 1.16(d) constitutes a separate violation of Rule 8.4(a). This case does not involve an unrealized
    attempt to violate the rules, or assisting or inducing another to do so, or violation through the acts of another.
    I therefore dissent from the holding of a Rule 8.4(a) violation.</p>

    <p class="Bodycopy">I concur in the proposed sanction of a public reprimand.</p>
