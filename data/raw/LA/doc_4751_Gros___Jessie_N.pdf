  <p class="headingstyle"> SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 03-B-3076</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: JESSIE N. GROS, III</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from nine counts of formal charges filed by the Office of
  Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") against respondent, Jessie N. Gros, III, a disbarred attorney. For the reasons assigned,
  we now permanently disbar respondent from the practice of law in Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 1995, respondent was disbarred from the practice of law based on six counts of misconduct,
  which included misleading a client about the status of a matter, failing to respond to discovery resulting in the
  dismissal of a client's suit, and commingling and converting client funds. <span class="cite"><i>In re: Gros</i>,
  95-0890 (La. 9/15/95), <a href="1995-09-15_1995-0809.htm">660 So. 2d 434</a></span> (<i>"Gros I"</i>).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In April 1996, the ODC filed additional charges against respondent for neglecting to file a suit,
  failing to communicate with a client, and commingling and converting client funds. We concluded that such conduct
  warranted disbarment. Because respondent was already disbarred as a result of Gros I, we extended by five years the
  minimum period within which he could apply for readmission. <i><span class="cite">In re:
  Gros</span></i><span class="cite">, 97-1295 (La. 9/24/97), <a href="1997-09-24_1997-1295.htm">699 So. 2d
  384</a></span> (<i>"Gros II"</i>).</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In July 1997, the ODC filed formal charges alleging that respondent neglected to file a suit,
  failed to communicate with a client, and commingled and converted  client funds. We concluded that disbarment was
  appropriate considering respondent engaged in some of the most serious professional misconduct an attorney can
  commit, and there were no mitigating factors present. However, because the conduct subject of the 1997 formal charges
  occurred within the same time frame as <i>Gros I</i> and <i>Gros II</i>, we determined it was appropriate to add the
  additional violations to respondent's record for consideration in the event he applied for readmission.

  799</a></span> (<i>"Gros III"</i>).<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>

  <h3>Counts I and II - The Porche Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Murphy Porche retained respondent to represent him in a personal injury matter. Respondent filed
  suit after prescription had run and the suit was dismissed as prescribed in 1989. Nevertheless, for a period of
  several years, respondent falsely informed his client that the suit was still pending. Mr. Porche's family discovered
  the truth in 1996 and filed a complaint with the ODC concerning respondent's conduct. Respondent failed to cooperate
  with the ODC in its investigation of the complaint.</p>

  <h3>Counts III and IV - The Knobloch Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In late 1993, James Knobloch, Jr. retained respondent to represent him in two separate legal
  matters. At the time respondent agreed to represent Mr. Knobloch, he was ineligible to practice law due to his
  failure to comply with his mandatory continuing legal education ("MCLE") requirements. Furthermore, respondent
  continued to handle Mr. Knobloch's legal matters after he was disbarred in September 1995. In November 1995,
  respondent informed Mr. Knobloch that one of the matters would soon be settled. In August 1996, respondent advised
  Mr. Knobloch that his case would be or had been settled. To date, respondent has failed to provide Mr. Knobloch with
  any documentation verifying that a suit was even filed. Further, respondent has not provided Mr. Knobloch with any
  settlement documentation or funds. Finally, respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the
  complaint filed against him by Mr. Knobloch.</p>

  <h3>Counts V and VI - The Menendez Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 1994, Diego Menendez retained respondent to represent him in a suit against the former First
  National Bank of Jefferson Parish. At the time respondent agreed to represent Mr. Menendez, he was ineligible to
  practice law due to his failure to comply with MCLE requirements. Furthermore, respondent continued to handle Mr.
  Menendez's legal matter after he was disbarred in September 1995. Respondent gave false information to Mr. Menendez
  about the status of his case, advising that the suit was active and that the court would soon render a decision. In
  1997, respondent ceased to communicate with Mr. Menendez entirely. Respondent has never furnished Mr. Menendez with
  any documentation confirming that he even filed suit nor has he furnished any settlement documents or funds. Further,
  respondent failed to provide Mr. Menendez with his file. Finally, respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in its
  investigation of the complaint filed against him by Mr. Menendez.</p>

  <h3>Counts VII and VIII - The Henderson Matter</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On November 1, 1992, respondent's uncle, Edward Henderson, was killed in an automobile accident.
  Respondent approached Mr. Henderson's family and offered to handle the wrongful death case as well as the estate
  without taking a fee. In late November and early December 1992, respondent received checks from South Farm Bureau
  Insurance totaling $25,500. Respondent forged the endorsements of Mr. Henderson's family members and converted the
  funds to his own use. In 1993, respondent passed the act of sale for the family home and converted the proceeds of
  that transaction to his own use. To conceal his misconduct, respondent misled the decedent's widow and children - his
  aunt and cousins - for a period of years. The Henderson heirs finally became aware of respondent's misconduct in
  early 1999 and filed a complaint with the ODC. Respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of
  the complaint.</p>

  <h3>Count IX - Respondent's Conviction</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On January 13, 1998, following his guilty plea in the United States District Court for the
  Eastern District of Louisiana, respondent was convicted of two felony counts of mail fraud. The conviction stemmed
  from respondent's conversion of $230,000 in settlement funds belonging to eight clients. On February 2, 2000,
  respondent was sentenced to serve eighteen months in prison, followed by a three-year period of supervised release,
  and fined $4,000.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On April 8, 2002, the ODC filed nine counts of formal charges against respondent, alleging that
  his conduct violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules
  <span class="Rules">1.1(a)</span> (failure to provide competent representation to a client),
  <span class="Rules">1.1(b)</span> (failure to comply with the mandatory continuing legal education requirements),
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client),
  <span class="Rules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a client), <span class="Rules">1.8</span> (prohibited
  transactions between a lawyer and a client), <span class="Rules">1.14</span> (client under a disability),
  <span class="Rules">1.15</span> (safekeeping property of clients or third persons),
  <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span> (termination of the representation), <span class="Rules">3.4(a)</span> (unlawfully
  obstructing another party's access to evidence), <span class="Rules">3.4(c)</span> (knowing disobedience of an
  obligation under the rules of a tribunal), <span class="Rules">5.5(a)</span> (engaging in the unauthorized practice
  of law), <span class="Rules">8.1(b)</span> (knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand for information from a
  disciplinary authority), <span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation),
  <span class="Rules">8.4(a)</span> (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct), <span class="Rules">8.4(b)</span>
  (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer),
  <span class="Rules">8.4(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation),
  <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation). The ODC further alleged
  that respondent's knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority
  constituted a violation of Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 9(c), and that he was convicted of a serious crime pursuant to
  Supreme Court <span class="Rules">Rule XIX, § 19(B)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges. Accordingly, the factual
  allegations contained therein were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3). No formal hearing was held, but the parties were given an opportunity to file with the
  hearing committee written arguments and documentary evidence on the issue of sanctions. In its submission, the ODC
  recommended the imposition of permanent disbarment for respondent's unauthorized practice of law and conviction of
  mail fraud, all of which occurred after his prior disbarments. Respondent filed nothing for the hearing committee's
  consideration.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2003-02-07_02-db-034.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Noting the factual allegations of the formal charges were deemed admitted pursuant to Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3), the hearing committee agreed that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct
  as charged, except that the committee found respondent's failure to cooperate with the ODC (specifically his failure
  to produce subpoenaed files and/or financial records during sworn statements) did not constitute dishonest or
  fraudulent conduct in violation of Rule 8.4(c). After reviewing the documentary evidence submitted by the ODC in
  response to the deemed admitted order, the committee concluded that the baseline sanction in this matter is
  disbarment. The committee found no mitigating factors are present but noted in aggravation that respondent has a
  prior history of similar disciplinary violations.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Relying on <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain</i>,
  <a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 So. 2d 470</a> (La. 1991)</span>, the committee determined that since some of
  the misconduct at issue in this matter occurred during the same time period as the misconduct forming the basis for
  respondent's previous disbarments, the discipline imposed should be determined as if all the proceedings were before
  the court simultaneously. Therefore, the committee did not consider permanent disbarment, but instead recommended
  that another disbarment be added to respondent's record for consideration in the event he should ever apply for
  readmission after becoming eligible to do so.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's failure to recommend permanent
  disbarment.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2003-11-05_02-DB-034.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board found the hearing committee's factual findings are not manifestly
  erroneous, and that the committee correctly applied the Rules of Professional Conduct. The board found the following
  aggravating factors are supported by the record: <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary offenses</span>;
  <span class="ABAstandard">dishonest or selfish motive</span>; <span class="ABAstandard">pattern of misconduct</span>;
  <span class="ABAstandard">multiple offenses</span>; <span class="ABAstandard">failure to comply with the rules or
  orders of the disciplinary agency</span>; <span class="ABAstandard">vulnerability of the victims</span>;
  <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span> (admitted 1981);
  <span class="ABAstandard">indifference to making restitution</span>; and <span class="ABAstandard">criminal
  conduct</span>. The board agreed with the committee's determination that the record does not support a finding of any
  mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board found that respondent intentionally violated duties owed to his clients, the public,
  the legal system, and the profession, causing actual injury. Respondent allowed Mr. Porche's personal injury claim to
  prescribe and misled him for years about the status of the matter. He agreed to represent Mr. Knobloch and Mr.
  Menendez during periods of ineligibility and misled both of them about the status of their suits. He converted funds
  in the two matters he was handling for the Henderson family. He failed to cooperate with the ODC's investigation of
  the complaints, causing undue cost and burden to the disciplinary system. His criminal conviction has also harmed the
  reputation of the legal community.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board agreed with the hearing committee that some of the misconduct at issue in this
  proceeding occurred during the same time period as the misconduct forming the basis of respondent's previous
  disbarments. However, the board noted that the misconduct alleged in Counts II, IV, VI and VIII (failure to cooperate
  with the ODC in its investigations), Count V (involving the unauthorized practice of law), and Count IX (respondent's
  conviction) occurred after the time frame of the misconduct forming the basis of the prior disbarments.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The board reviewed this court's guidelines for permanent disbarment and concluded respondent's
  conduct fell within at least two of the guidelines. In particular, it found respondent engaged in the practice of law
  in the Menendez and Knobloch matters after his 1995 disbarment in Gros I, conduct which fell under
  <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 8</span>. Further, he pled guilty to mail fraud, a felony which reflects upon his
  moral fitness to practice law, following the 1997 extension of that disbarment in Gros II, conduct which fell under
  <span class="Guidelines">Guideline 9</span>. Under these circumstances, the board recommended that respondent be
  permanently disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite"><i>In re: Quaid</i>,
  94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>; <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana
  State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall</i>, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The deemed admitted facts in this case support a finding of professional misconduct that is
  unquestionably serious in nature. Respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law after being disbarred by
  this court and, in fact, did so on more than one occasion and in more than one client matter. Furthermore, respondent
  has been convicted of a serious felony offense in connection with his conversion of $230,000 in settlement funds
  belonging to some eight different clients. No less serious is respondent's failure to cooperate in the numerous
  disciplinary investigations conducted by the ODC.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional misconduct, we now turn to a determination of the appropriate sanction.
  In doing so, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect
  the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana
  State Bar Ass'n v. Reis</i>, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline
  to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in light
  of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Whittington</i>,
  <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As a threshold matter, we recognize that some of respondent's misconduct in the instant matter
  occurred during the same general time as the misconduct at issue in Gros I, Gros II and Gros III. In <i>Louisiana
  State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain</i>, <a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 So. 2d 470</a> (La. 1991), we observed that
  it is generally inappropriate to discipline an attorney a second time for misconduct that occurred before or
  concurrently with the misconduct at issue in a prior disciplinary proceeding. Nonetheless, we find that the most
  serious misconduct in this case, including respondent's unauthorized practice of law, his guilty plea to two counts
  of felony mail fraud, and his failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigations, occurred after the time frame
  at issue in the prior proceedings. Under such circumstances, we decline to employ the Chatelain approach.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The sheer magnitude of respondent's misconduct requires this court to consider whether permanent
  disbarment is warranted. In Appendix E to the Rules of Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, we have set forth several
  guidelines illustrating the types of cases which might warrant permanent disbarment. These guidelines were not
  intended to bind this court in its decisionmaking, but to provide "useful information to the public and to lawyers
  concerning the types of conduct the Court might consider to be worthy of permanent disbarment." We find respondent's
  conduct in the matters at issue falls squarely within Guidelines 8 and 9, which provide for permanent disbarment
  under the following circumstances:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>GUIDELINE 8. Following notice, engaging in the unauthorized practice of law subsequent to resigning from the Bar
    Association, or during the period of time in which the lawyer is suspended from the practice of law or
    disbarred.</p>

    <p>GUIDELINE 9. Instances of serious attorney misconduct or conviction of a serious crime, when the misconduct or
    conviction is preceded by suspension or disbarment for prior instances of serious attorney misconduct or conviction
    of a serious crime. Serious crime is defined in Rule XIX, Section 19. Serious attorney misconduct is defined for
    purposes of these guidelines as any misconduct which results in a suspension of more than one year.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">We do not lightly impose the sanction of permanent disbarment. <span class="cite"><i>In re:
  Morphis</i>, 01-2803 (La. 12/4/02), <a href="2002-12-04_2001-2803.htm">831 So. 2d 934</a></span>. Nonetheless, we are
  firmly convinced that we would be remiss in our constitutional duty to regulate the practice of law if we did not
  impose that sanction here. Respondent's actions in the instant matter, combined with his extensive prior disciplinary
  record, convincingly demonstrate he does not possess the requisite moral fitness to practice law in this state. He
  must be permanently disbarred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will accept the disciplinary board's recommendation and impose permanent
  disbarment.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Jessie N. Gros, III, Louisiana Bar Roll No. 6352, be permanently
  disbarred. Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered that respondent be permanently
  prohibited from being readmitted to the practice of law in this state. All costs and expenses in the matter are
  assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty
  days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> In addition to the three proceedings
  in this court, respondent was also admonished by the disciplinary board on eight occasions between 1990 and 1995 for
  failing to cooperate with the ODC in its investigations.</p>
