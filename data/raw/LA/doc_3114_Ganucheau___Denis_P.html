  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: DENIS P. GANUCHEAU</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 96-DB-069</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of formal charges against Respondent, Denis
  P. Ganucheau.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Formal charges were filed against the Respondent on September 18, 1996 consisting of two counts.
  These counts allege that the Respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct by failing to safe keep client
  property, failing to return client property, failing to properly supervise his nonlawyer assistant, and failing to
  cooperate in a disciplinary investigation. Thereafter, the Respondent filed a pleading entitled "First Response of
  Respondent" on November 15, 1996.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On December 11, 1996, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") filed a prehearing memorandum in
  this matter. A hearing on the merits before hearing committee #10 was held on June 23, 1997. The hearing committee's
  report was issued on May 19, 1998. The hearing committee found that the Respondent had neglected a legal matter with
  which he was entrusted and failed to return client property. The committee recommended that the Respondent be issued
  a public reprimand and assessed with all costs of the proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On June 29, 1998, the oral argument in this matter was continued without date, to be reset with
  two other matters involving the Respondent, 98-DB-015 c/w 98-DB-039. Oral argument before the Board was held on
  September 30, 1999. Respondent appeared on his own behalf, and the Deputy Disciplinary Counsel Bernadine Johnson
  appeared on behalf of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.</p>

  <h2><b>FORMAL CHARGES</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Count I of the formal charges alleges that on or about May 30, 1992, the Respondent was retained
  to represent Floyd Ketchum in a claim for property damages against Terminix. The Respondent is alleged to have
  charged and collected advance costs of $400.00. Although the Respondent thereafter assured his client that he had
  filed a lawsuit on his behalf, in fact the Respondent failed to protect his client's interests by timely filing legal
  proceedings. Respondent failed, refused or neglected to act in the matter, and misled Mr. Ketchum about the status of
  the case. On or about February 1, 1995, Mr. Ketchum terminated Respondent's services and requested that Respondent
  release his file to his new attorney. Despite repeated requests by Mr. Ketchum and his attorney, Respondent failed,
  refused, or neglected to release the file, withdraw from representation and failed to account for and refund
  unexpended funds. Respondent subsequently stated that he was unable to locate Mr. Ketchum's file, that he had no
  clear recollection of the matter, but that he did remember having instructed a member of his clerical staff to
  reproduce the file and forward it as requested. Respondent failed to safe keep client property, failed to return
  client property, and fail to properly supervise his nonlawyer assistant. Respondent's conduct is alleged to have
  violated Rules <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> , <span class="allegedrules">1.4</span> ,
  <span class="allegedrules">1.5(f)(4)</span>, <span class="allegedrules">1.15(b)</span>,
  <span class="allegedrules">1.16(a)</span>(d), <span class="allegedrules">5.3(b)</span>(c), and
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span>(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Count II alleges that a copy of the complaint which is the subject of Count I was forwarded to
  the Respondent by certified mail dated June 14, 1995 to his registration address. Pursuant to his professional
  obligations, Respondent was directed to submit a written response to the compliant filed by Mr. Ketchum. Respondent
  failed, refused, or neglected to submit a response. On December 4, 1995, Respondent was served with a subpoena,
  issued pursuant to the authority of the Supreme Court of Louisiana, ordering him to appear before Disciplinary
  Counsel at 10:30 a.m. on December 12, 1995 to testify in the investigation of a complaint relative to the matter in
  Count I. Respondent was subsequently asked to respond to Mr. Ketchum's continuing compliant concerning Respondent's
  efforts to locate his file and to account for the unexpended funds. Respondent failed, refused, or neglected to
  submit a supplemental response. Respondent has disobeyed an obligation under the rules of a tribunal and failed to
  cooperate in a disciplinary investigation. Respondent's conduct is alleged to have violated Louisiana Supreme Court
  Rule XIX, Section 9(a)(c), and Rules 8.1(b)(c), and 8.4(a)(g) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2><span class="cite"><a   href="../HC/1998-05-19_96-DB-069.htm">FINDINGS OF THE HEARING
  COMMITTEE</a></span></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">At the hearing held in this matter, the ODC called Floyd J. Ketchum as a witness. The ODC also
  submitted the affidavit of Mr. Ketchum's new attorney, Jerry Sullivan, in lieu of live testimony. The Respondent
  testified on his own behalf. He also called as a witness Arthur Dupre, an associate in Mr. Sullivan's office, in
  order to question him concerning the current status of the case. The ODC also submitted seven exhibits into
  evidence.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing the evidence and the testimony, the hearing committee issued its report on May
  19, 1998. The hearing committee found that the Respondent neglected a legal matter with which he was entrusted (a
  violation of Rule <span class="Rules">1.3</span>) and failed to return client property when requested to do so (a
  violation of Rule <span class="Rules">1.15(b)</span>). The hearing committee also found that the other violations
  with which Respondent was charged were not proven by clear and convincing evidence. Since the Complainant and ODC do
  not assert a claim for the $400.00 in advance costs, these funds were presumably refunded.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee noted as mitigating factors: 1) <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a
  prior disciplinary record</span>; 2) <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a selfish or dishonest motive</span>; 3)
  <span class="ABAstandard">full and free disclosure</span>; and 4) <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>. No
  aggravating factors were found.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In light of the violations and the mitigating factors, the hearing committee recommended that the
  Respondent be issued a public reprimand for his conduct and that he be cast for all costs of these proceedings. No
  objection to the hearing committee's report was filed by either party. The absence of an objection by the ODC is
  significant here in that it had sought suspension, instead of reprimand, as the sanction in this matter.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As noted above, the Hearing Committee made the factual finding that the Respondent neglected Mr.
  Ketchum's legal matter. The Respondent objected to this finding at the oral argument held before the Disciplinary
  Board. After reviewing the record, including the transcript of the hearing, the Board determines that the Hearing
  Committee's finding was correct and does not constitute manifest error. <u>Rosell v. Esco</u>, 549 So.2d 840 (La.
  1989). The transcript indicates that the Respondent was either retained or employed to investigate the termite
  situation at Mr. Ketchum's home in May of 1992. He realized that to continue with a lawsuit, a succession proceeding
  pertaining to Mr. Ketchum's first wife would have to be completed. Judgment of possession in this proceeding was
  signed on March 1, 1994, and no suit in the Terminix matter was filed through the date the Respondent was discharged
  on February 1, 1995. (Trans., p. 57-58). In response to the hearing committee's question of why no action was taken
  during the March 1, 1994 and February 1, 1995 time period, the Respondent only stated that he "was again evaluating
  the situation," and securing the necessary expert witnesses. (Trans., p. 58). This is contrary to the Respondent's
  previous testimony that at the time he was relieved as counsel in the case, the pleadings were in the process of
  being drafted and the expert witnesses were retained. (Trans., p. 39). Although the Respondent testified that prior
  to the time he was discharged, Mr. Ketchum had in fact signed a retainer agreement with one of the contractors to
  serve as an expert witness in court, no such documentation was submitted into evidence nor were any other documents
  submitted to indicate that the Respondent had in fact worked on the matter during this time period. The Board must
  deduce from such testimony and lack of documentation that the Respondent simply had neglected the matter at least
  from March 1, 1994 until February 1, 1995. Accordingly, the Board must find that the Respondent's objection to this
  finding of the Hearing Committee is without merit.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board finds that the Respondent has violated duties owed to his client and that he acted
  negligently. Although no actual injury befell Mr. Ketchum, potential injury existed in that Mr. Ketchum's case could
  have prescribed had subsequent counsel not been obtained. The Board also accepts the mitigating factors found by the
  hearing committee and finds no aggravating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Under A.B.A. <i>Standard for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>, Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span>, a reprimand is appropriate when a lawyer is negligent and does not act with
  reasonable diligence in representing a client. Under Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.13</span>, a reprimand is
  appropriate when a lawyer is negligent in dealing with client property and causes injury or potential injury to a
  client.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This matter is similar to the recent case of <span class="cite"><u>In re Dolbear</u>,
  <a href="1999-02-24_98-DB-061.htm">98-DB-061</a> (2/24/99)</span>. In that case, Dolbear was given the criminal file
  of a potential client to review. When the individual decided not to retain the Respondent, he requested the return of
  the file; however, Respondent was unable to promptly return the file becaue he had negligently lost it. Respondent
  also accepted a retainer from four Mexican nationals to try to obtain their release from jail. He agreed to refund
  the money if he was unsuccessful. When he was unsuccessful, he failed to promptly return the fee. He also failed to
  cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the complaints. Bd. Op. at 1-2. The Board found that Dolbear
  negligently failed to act with reasonable diligence and negligently handled client property. A proposed consent
  discipine of a public reprimand was submitted by the parties and accepted by the Board. <u>Id.</u> at 2-3.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Here, as in <u>Dolbear</u>, the Respondent was given a case to investigate and to proceed to suit
  against Terminix if warranted. When Mr. Ketchum decided to fire Mr. Ganucheau and retained Mr. Sullivan to proceed
  with the suit, he requested, via correspondence, the return of his file. Respondent testified that the file had been
  lost during a move or misplaced in another attorney's closed files. He was therefore unable to return the file
  promptly, despite his allegedly diligent efforts to find the file. The evidence submitted shows that it took
  Respondent over two years to return the file to Mr. Sullivan. Fortunately, the record in this matter indicates that
  Mr. Ketchum did not claim any injury from this delay; Mr. Sullivan apparently filed suit timely on Mr. Ketchum's
  behalf.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Given the A.B.A. standards cited above and the holding in <u>Dolbear</u>, the recommendation of
  the hearing committee of a public reprimand, along with payment of the costs of these proceedings, is proper.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, the Disciplinary Board orders that the Respondent, Denis P. Ganucheau, receive a
  public reprimand and further orders that Respondent be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings,
  with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this Order until paid.</p>
