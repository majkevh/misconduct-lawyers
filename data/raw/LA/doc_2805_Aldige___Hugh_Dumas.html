  <h2>LOUISIANA ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY BOARD</h2>

  <h2>IN RE: HUGH D. ALDIGE</h2>

  <h2>NUMBER 00-DB-118</h2>

  <h2><b>RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a Petition for Consent Discipline
  (herein "Petition") by the respondent, Hugh D. Aldige (herein "Respondent"), of Metairie, Louisiana, prior to the
  filing of formal charges. The Board accepts the Petition and orders a public reprimand be issued against
  Respondent.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As a result of two complaints received from clients of Respondent, the Office of Disciplinary
  Counsel (herein "ODC") initiated investigative matters numbers 0008292 and 0007740. In response to these
  investigations, prior to the institution of formal charges, Respondent filed a Petition for Consent Discipline and a
  Stipulation of Facts on September 20, 2000. On the same day, ODC filed a concurrence with the Petition. On September
  28, 2000, a panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed the documents filed in this matter.</p>

  <h2>STIPULATED FACTS</h2>

  <h3>Helmker Complaint</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">According to the stipulated facts filed by Respondent, Mr. Helmker retained Respondent to assist
  him in a criminal matter. The division of the fee and all attorneys who would be assisting in the representation were
  not clearly delineated to the client in writing. In connection with this matter, Respondent admits to violating Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.5</span><a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" class="fn" id="_ednref1">[i]</a> and
  <span class="allegedrules">1.7</span><a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn" id="_ednref2">[ii]</a> of the Rules
  of Professional Conduct, by not properly having a division of fees between lawyers who were not in the same firm.</p>

  <h3>Cefalu Complaint</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In September 1998, ODC received a complaint on behalf of a Mr. Cefalu. In 1993, Mr. Cefalu
  retained Respondent to defend him from a suit by American Medical Supply, Inc. for a disputed debt.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In January 1996, Respondent took action to judicially reinscribe a judgment on a note in an
  unrelated matter. At the time, the current owner of the note was D'Aquin Property, solely owned by Respondent's wife.
  The reinscription was done before Respondent withdrew from the earlier representation. Respondent admits no
  discussion was made to either client regarding possible conflicts in the matter in violation of Rule 1.7 of the Rules
  of Professional Conduct.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" class="fn" id="_ednref3">[iii]</a></p>

  <h2>PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent tenders a conditional admission to the misconduct in exchange for a stated form of
  discipline, to wit, a public reprimand, with the following special conditions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">a. Respondent shall enroll in and attend one full day of Ethics School administered by the
    LSBA's Practice Assistance and Improvement Committee;</p>

    <p class="inverted">b.  Respondent shall cooperate completely with any and all investigations by the Office of
    Disciplinary Counsel and promptly respond to any and all complaints; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">c. Respondent shall refrain from engaging in any violation of the Rules of Professional
    Conduct.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system,
  or  to the profession;</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board finds that Respondent's actions violated duties owed to his clients. Respondent asserts
  that his actions in this matter were unintentional. While the documents filed in this matter do not specify what
  harm, if any, was suffered by Respondent's clients, Respondent further asserts that he has taken steps to "rectify
  any harm he may have caused his prior clients."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Aggravating factors were not identified to the Board. Respondent notes that "in his thirty-two
  (32) years of practicing law, [Respondent] has never been sanctioned or disciplined." The Board finds the mitigating
  factor of <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span> [Standard 9.32(a)] and the
  aggravating factor of <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span> [Standard
  9.22(i)] are present in this matter. The mitigating factor of timely good faith effort to make restitution or to
  rectify consequences of misconduct is present [Standard 9.32(d)].</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <h3><b>I.</b> ABA Standards</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanction</i>
  (herein "Standard") to determine the baseline sanction by "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's mental state and
  the extent of the injury caused; and then adjust the sanction in accordance with the aggravating and mitigating
  factors present." <span class="cite"><i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94);
  <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 350</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.63</span> provides for reprimand when "a lawyer negligently
  fails to provide a client with accurate or complete information, and causes injury or potential injury to the
  client." In the Helmker matter, Respondent admits to failing to properly have a division of fees between lawyers who
  were not in the same firm, and failing to clearly delineate this information to the client in writing. As noted, the
  nature of the injury to Mr. Helmker is not outlined in the documents submitted by Respondent. However, the potential
  for injury exists when an attorney neglects his duty to provide a client with complete information.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.33</span> provides for reprimand when "a lawyer is negligent
  in determining whether the representation of a client may be materially affected by the lawyer's own interests, or
  whether the representation will adversely affect another client, and causes injury or potential injury to a client."
  In the Cefalu matter, Respondent admits that he failed to discuss with Mr. Cefalu the existence of possible conflicts
  between his representation of Mr. Cefalu and his representation of the owner of the note. While the documents
  submitted in this matter fail to elaborate upon any injury sustained by these clients, the potential for injury to
  either or both clients existed.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based upon the ABA guidelines, reprimand is an appropriate baseline sanction for Respondent's
  violation of Rules 1.5, and 1.7 of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h3><b>II. </b> Relevant Case Law</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Board also looks to relevant case law for assistance in determining an appropriate sanction
  for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. However, as noted by ODC, "finding jurisprudence that will
  mirror a disciplinary case is difficult, if not impossible . . . ." Research into cases of attorney misconduct
  involving violations of Rules 1.5 and 1.7 has failed to disclose any cases that are factually similar to the instant
  matter. The cases identified by this research seem to be limited to situations involving conduct on the part of the
  attorney more egregious than is present in this matter.</p>

  <h3><b>III.  </b> Conclusion</h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The commentary to Standard <span class="ABAstandard">2.5</span> states that, "A reprimand is
  appropriate in cases where the lawyer's conduct, although violating ethical standards, is not serious enough to
  warrant suspension or disbarment." The ABA guidelines applying this principle suggest that the proposed sanction is
  appropriate for Respondent's violation of Rules <span class="Rules">1.5</span> and <span class="Rules">1.7</span> of
  the Rules of Professional Conduct. Furthermore, the jurisprudence of the Court suggests that the nature of
  Respondent's misconduct in this matter does not warrant the imposition of a harsher sanction.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the petition for consent discipline be accepted, and
  that a public reprimand be issued against the respondent, Hugh D. Aldige, with the following special conditions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">a. Respondent shall enroll in and attend one full day of Ethics School administered by the
    LSBA's Practice Assistance and Improvement Committee;</p>

    <p class="inverted">b.  Respondent shall cooperate completely with any and all investigations by the Office of
    Disciplinary Counsel and promptly respond to any and all complaints; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">c. Respondent shall refrain from engaging in any violation of the Rules of Professional
    Conduct.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="Bodycopy">It is further ordered that Respondent be assessed the costs and expenses of these proceedings,
  with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this ruling until paid.</p>
