<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 02-B-2155</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: JOSEPH R. CASANOVA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by 
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Joseph R. 
Casanova, an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Two sets of formal charges were filed against respondent by 
the ODC. The first, 98-DB-078, was filed on October 23, 1998 and encompasses 
eighteen counts of<br>
misconduct involving six of respondent’s clients. The second, 99-DB-030, was 
filed on April 23, 1999 and encompasses three counts of misconduct involving 
three of respondent’s clients. The two sets of formal charges were consolidated 
by order of the hearing committee chairman on May 5, 1999. </p>
<h3>98-DB-078</h3>
<h4>Counts I - III (The Green Matter)</h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">Carla Green retained respondent to handle a divorce and 
child custody matter. Respondent neglected the matter, failed to refund the 
unearned portion of the legal fee he was paid, and failed to return Ms. Green’s 
file to her upon the termination of the representation. In addition, respondent 
failed to answer the complaint filed against him by Ms. Green, necessitating the 
issuance of a subpoena by the ODC.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent’s conduct in the Green 
matter violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span> (failure to act with diligence and promptness in 
representing a client), <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span> (termination of the representation), 
<span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span> 
(failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation), and 
<span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> (failure to 
cooperate with the ODC in its investigation) of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct. Respondent answered the formal charges and generally denied any 
intentional misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Ms. Green did not appear to testify at the formal hearing on 
the merits. As a result, the hearing committee recommended that Counts I and II 
be dismissed,1 maintaining only Count III, pertaining to respondent’s failure to 
cooperate in the investigation of Ms. Green’s complaint. After consideration, 
the hearing committee concluded the ODC proved this violation by clear and 
convincing evidence.</p>
<h4>Counts IV - VII (The Margiotta Matter)</h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">Frank Margiotta retained respondent to handle a divorce 
matter. Respondent neglected the matter, failed to communicate with his client, 
failed to refund the unearned portion of the legal fee he was paid, and failed 
to return Mr. Margiotta’s file to him upon the termination of the 
representation. In addition, respondent failed to answer the complaint filed 
against him by Mr. Margiotta, necessitating the issuance of a subpoena by the 
ODC.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent’s conduct in the Margiotta 
matter violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, <span class="Rules">1.4</span> (failure to communicate with a client), 
<span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span>, 
<span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent answered the 
formal charges and generally denied any intentional misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Mr. Margiotta did not appear to testify at the formal 
hearing on the merits. As a result, the hearing committee recommended that 
Counts IV through VI be dismissed, maintaining only Count VII, pertaining to 
respondent’s failure to cooperate in the investigation of Mr. Margiotta’s 
complaint. After consideration, the hearing committee concluded the ODC proved 
this violation by clear and convincing evidence.</p>
<h4>Counts VIII - IX (The Ban Matter)</h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">Bonnie Ban retained respondent to handle a bankruptcy 
matter. Respondent failed to provide competent representation to his client and 
failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the complaint filed by 
Ms. Ban.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent’s conduct in the Ban matter 
violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.1(a)</span> (failure to provide competent representation to a client), 
<span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent answered the 
formal charges and generally denied any intentional misconduct. Ms. Ban did not 
appear to testify at the formal hearing on the merits. As a result, the hearing 
committee recommended that both counts relating to the Ban matter be dismissed.</p>
<h4>Counts X - XIII (The Bourgeois Matter)</h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">In July 1995, Garry Bourgeois retained respondent to handle 
a wrongful death claim arising out of the drowning of his daughter, Dana 
Bourgeois. Respondent timely filed suit in the matter, but thereafter neglected 
the case, failed to communicate with his client, and failed to return Mr. 
Bourgeois’ file to him upon the termination of the representation. In addition, 
respondent failed to answer the complaint filed against him by Mr. Bourgeois, 
necessitating the issuance of a subpoena by the ODC.&nbsp; The ODC alleges that 
respondent’s conduct in the Bourgeois matter violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, 
<span class="Rules">1.4</span>, <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span>, 
<span class="Rules">8.1(c)</span>, and <span class="Rules">8.4(g)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent answered the formal charges and generally denied 
any intentional misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After consideration, the hearing committee concluded the ODC 
proved these violations by clear and convincing evidence.</p>
<h4>Counts XIV - XV (The Demarest Matter) </h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">Candace Demarest retained respondent to handle a divorce and 
child custody matter. Respondent neglected the matter and failed to cooperate 
with the ODC in its investigation of the complaint filed by Ms. Demarest.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent’s conduct in the Demarest 
matter violated Rules 1.3, 8.1(c), and 8.4(g) of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct. Respondent<br>
answered the formal charges and generally denied any intentional misconduct Ms. 
Demarest did not appear to testify at the formal hearing on the merits. As<br>
a result, the hearing committee recommended that both counts relating to the 
Demarest matter be dismissed.</p>
<h4>Counts XVI - XVIII (The Gullage Matter)</h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">In May 1997, Sonja Tillery Gullage retained respondent to 
handle a domestic matter. Respondent received filing fees from Ms. Gullage, but 
he did not pay the fees to the court. In addition, respondent neglected the 
matter he was retained to handle and he failed to answer the complaint filed 
against him by Ms. Gullage, necessitating the issuance of a subpoena by the ODC.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent’s conduct in the Gullage 
matter violated Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span>, 1.15 (safekeeping property of clients or third 
persons), 8.1(c), and 8.4(g) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent 
answered the formal charges and generally denied any intentional misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After consideration, the hearing committee concluded the ODC 
proved by clear and convincing evidence that respondent neglected Ms. Gullage’s 
legal matter and failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation of the 
complaint Ms. Gullage filed. However, the committee found there was conflicting 
testimony regarding the sums paid by Ms. Gullage to respondent, and whether 
those funds were intended for court costs or for attorney’s fees. Accordingly, 
the committee concluded the ODC did not prove by clear and convincing evidence 
that respondent violated Rule 1.15 by failing to pay to the court sums intended 
for filing fees or other costs.</p>
<h3>99-DB-030</h3>
<h4>Count I (The Hymel Matter)</h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">Troy Hymel paid respondent $650 to handle two criminal 
matters. Respondent neglected the matters and failed to communicate with his 
client. In addition, respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in its 
investigation of the complaint filed by Mr. Hymel.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent’s conduct in the Hymel 
matter violated Rules 1.3, 1.16, 8.1(c), and 8.4(g) of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct. Respondent answered the formal charges and denied any misconduct. Mr. 
Hymel did not appear to testify at the formal hearing on the merits. As a 
result, the hearing committee recommended that Count I relating to the Hymel 
matter be dismissed. </p>
<h4>Count II (The Kraus Matter)</h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">In 1995, Robert Kraus, Sr. retained respondent to handle a 
divorce and child custody matter. Respondent obtained the divorce and an interim 
custody judgment in a reasonable period of time; however, over the following two 
years, he failed, despite repeated requests, to obtain a judgment of permanent 
custody or to provide any adequate reason for the delay. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleges that respondent’s conduct in the Kraus 
matter violated Rules 1.3 and 1.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct. 
Respondent answered the formal charges and denied any misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After consideration, the hearing committee concluded the ODC 
did not prove the alleged violations by clear and convincing evidence. The 
committee found that the complaint filed by Mr. Kraus stemmed from a 
misunderstanding with respondent regarding the objectives of the representation, 
and that in any event, the two-year period of inactivity did not adversely 
affect Mr. Kraus’ interests or prejudice or compromise his rights.</p>
<h4>Count III (The Marquet Matter)</h4>
<p class="Bodycopy">In March 1998, Carolyn Marquet retained respondent to handle 
a divorce and ancillary matters. Respondent filed a petition for divorce and 
obtained interim spousal support for Ms. Marquet, but he never finalized the 
matter and failed to communicate with his client. Eventually, Ms. Marquet’s 
husband obtained a divorce and a reduction of the interim spousal support 
previously ordered; however, respondent did not notify Ms. Marquet of this fact. 
Moreover, although Ms. Marquet terminated respondent’s representation and 
requested an accounting, respondent failed to provide the accounting, failed to 
refund the unearned portion of the legal fee he was paid, and failed to return 
Ms. Marquet’s file to her.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">After consideration, the hearing committee concluded the ODC 
proved by clear and convincing evidence that respondent neglected Ms. Marquet’s 
legal matter and failed to communicate with her. However, the committee found no 
evidence that respondent failed to release Ms. Marquet’s file to her in a timely 
fashion after being discharged, and hence concluded that he did not violate Rule 
1.16(d).<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> </p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:98-DB-078.HC --#">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering the record, the hearing committee found that the 
baseline sanction for respondent’s misconduct is at least a reprimand but not 
more than a suspension from the practice of law. The committee determined that 
several aggravating factors exist, including prior disciplinary offenses,<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> 
pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, bad faith obstruction of the 
disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the rules or 
orders of the disciplinary agency, and substantial experience in the practice of 
law (admitted 1987). The committee also recognized several mitigating factors, 
including personal or emotional problems,<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> good character and 
reputation, and remorse. The committee concluded, however, that while the 
aggravating factors heavily outweigh the mitigating factors, respondent is 
nonetheless reformable:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Respondent herein does not appear to be completely unable to discharge his 
  professional duties. In fact, Respondent seems to be a basically competent 
  lawyer but lacks or has forgotten skills related to the business aspects of 
  practicing law — heretofore unable to recognize and correct serious problems 
  with his business practices and unwilling to place limitations upon his 
  practice and the number of clients which might be adequately, professionally 
  served by him. Respondent also seems to lack a sincere and healthy respect for 
  the disciplinary process, exhibiting a reluctantly reactive rather than 
  proactive approach to addressing disciplinary matters that involve him.</p>
  <p>There seems to be a good chance for Respondent’s reform — but not without 
  serious correction, rehabilitation and, unfortunately, deterrence. Four 
  separate previous admonitions for similar professional negligence did not have 
  the effect of correcting Respondent’s professional shortcomings nor of 
  deterring Respondent from committing further similar acts of misconduct nor of 
  protecting the public or the legal profession as a whole. . . . A license to 
  practice law is both a privilege and [a] responsibility which must not be 
  taken for granted. The safety and confidence of the general public — 
  especially those individuals who might one day become Respondent’s clients — 
  together with the integrity of the legal profession and the disciplinary 
  process demand more than just another simple, easily-forgotten warning to 
  Respondent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on this reasoning, the committee recommended 
respondent be suspended from the practice of law for eighteen months, with all 
but six months deferred. Prior to reinstatement, the committee recommended that 
respondent be required to attend not less than six additional hours of CLE 
specifically related to law office management, and that upon reinstatement, he 
be placed on supervised probation for a period of eighteen months “for the 
purpose of ensuring that Respondent’s list of active clients does not swell 
again to such numbers as to overwhelm and greatly exceed Respondent’s abilities 
to serve them effectively/professionally and for the purpose of monitoring 
Respondent’s office and business practices regarding the manner in which he is 
servicing those clients.”</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the 
hearing committee’s recommendation.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:98-DB-078.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board agreed that the hearing committee’s 
factual findings are supported by the record, and that the hearing committee 
correctly applied the Rules of Professional Conduct. With respect to the failure 
to cooperate charges, the board found respondent acted knowingly or negligently 
and that his actions caused harm by requiring the ODC to expend additional time 
and money in attempting to obtain information and a response from him. With 
respect to the client-related charges (neglect of legal matters, failure to 
communicate with clients, and failure to properly terminate the representation), 
the board found respondent acted negligently and that his actions, in some 
cases, caused harm or potential harm to his clients. The board concurred in the 
aggravating and mitigating factors cited by the hearing committee.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering the ABA’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer 
Sanctions and the prior jurisprudence, the board concluded the baseline sanction 
for respondent’s misconduct is a one-year suspension from the practice of law. 
In this case, however, the board felt an upward deviation was warranted in light 
of the fact that five clients were harmed by respondent’s knowing or negligent 
misconduct, and considering the aggravating factors, particularly respondent’s 
prior disciplinary record. The board agreed with the hearing committee that an 
eighteen-month suspension, followed by probation, is appropriate, and that 
deferral of a portion of the suspension is justified considering the mitigating 
factors and the protections provided by the imposition of a probationary period. 
Accordingly, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the 
practice of law for eighteen months, with all but six months deferred, followed 
by an eighteen-month period of supervised probation, subject to the conditions 
recommended by the hearing committee. The board also recommended that respondent 
be assessed with all costs and expenses of these proceedings, with legal 
interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of the 
court’s judgment until paid.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">One member of the disciplinary board agreed that an 
eighteen-month suspension is appropriate in this case, but dissented from the 
deferral of any portion of the suspension.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the 
recommendation of the majority of the disciplinary board. However, pursuant to 
Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 11(G)(1)(a), this court ordered the parties to submit 
written briefs within twenty days, addressing the appropriateness of the 
proposed sanction. Both parties timely filed briefs in response to this order.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original 
jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V, § 5(B). Consequently, we act as 
triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine 
whether the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence.
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94),
<a href="#!-- #ID:646%20So.2d%20343 --#">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>;
<span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Boutall</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:597%20So.2d%20444 --#">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. 
While we are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the 
hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error 
standard is applicable to the committee’s factual findings. See
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Caulfield</i>, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96),
<a href="#!-- #ID:683%20So.2d%20714 --#">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>;
<span class="CITE"><i>In re: Pardue</i>, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94),
<a href="#!-- #ID:633%20So.2d%20150 --#">633 So. 2d 150</a></span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on our independent review, we conclude the findings of 
the hearing committee and the disciplinary board are supported by the record. It 
is evident that respondent failed to use reasonable diligence on behalf of his 
clients and failed to communicate with them, failed to return unearned fees or 
to provide accountings, failed to properly terminate the representation of his 
clients, and failed to cooperate with the ODC.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional violations, we now turn to a 
determination of the appropriate sanction for this misconduct. In determining an 
appropriate sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed 
to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the 
integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="CITE"><i>
Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Reis</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">
513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon 
the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered 
in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>
Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Trichel</i>, 00-1304 (La. 
8/31/00), <a href="#!-- #ID:767%20So.2d%20694 --#">767 So. 2d 694</a></span>, we 
recognized that the baseline sanction for neglect of a client matter, failure to 
communicate, and failure to properly terminate the representation of one client 
was a one-year suspension from the practice of law. However, we found the 
aggravating factors in the case, particularly the respondent’s prior discipline 
for similar misconduct, justified raising the sanction to an eighteen-month 
suspension.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The instant matter involves multiple counts of neglect of 
legal matters and failure to communicate involving several clients, as well as 
charges of failure to cooperate and the failure of respondent to properly 
terminate the representation of his clients. Consequently, the baseline sanction 
in this case is greater than the one-year suspension identified in <i>Trichel</i>. 
Although some mitigating factors exist, the hearing committee properly 
recognized that they are heavily outweighed by the aggravating factors present. 
Most disturbing among the aggravating factors is respondent’s prior disciplinary 
record of four admonitions between 1996 and 1998 for misconduct <a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> 
Each of these admonitions presented respondent with an opportunity to correct 
his deficiencies, but it is obvious that he did not avail himself of the chances 
he was given. Respondent now represents to this court that he has taken steps to 
improve the management of his office, and asks for a second chance. While we 
commend respondent for his efforts, there is a limit to this court’s patience. 
We will not tolerate a pattern of conduct which places an attorney’s clients at 
risk. Quite simply, nothing less than a fairly lengthy suspension would be 
responsive to the misconduct in this case.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will suspend respondent from the practice of 
law for a period of eighteen months.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendation of the 
hearing committee and disciplinary board, and considering the record and the 
additional briefing of the parties, it is ordered that Joseph R. Casanova be 
suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of eighteen months. 
All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in 
accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence 
thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s judgment until paid.</p>

<hr noshade color="#000000" align="left" width="100" size="1">
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> The disciplinary board concurred in the dismissal of 
these charges, as well as the committee’s recommendation to dismiss the other 
charges in which the complainant did not appear to testify in person at the 
formal hearing. The ODC did not file an objection in this court to the 
dismissal. Our review of the record indicates the committee’s dismissal was 
appropriate, as there is no clear and convincing evidence of a professional 
violation by respondent with respect to these charges. Accordingly, the merits 
of these allegations of misconduct will not be discussed further.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> Respondent released Ms. Marquet’s case file to her new
