  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 05-B-1686</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: W. EUGENE JESSUP</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 21(A), the Office of Disciplinary  
  Counsel ("ODC") filed this reciprocal discipline proceeding against the respondent,  
  W. Eugene Jessup, an attorney licensed to practice law in the States of Louisiana,  
  Tennessee, and Georgia, based upon discipline imposed by the Supreme Court of  
  Tennessee.</p>

  <h2>UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In 1996, respondent began representing a client in a highly contested alimony  
  case in Tennessee. Ultimately, respondent was successful in obtaining a judgment  
  that awarded his client $57,400 plus $12,500 in attorney's fees. Based upon his  
  contractual agreement with his client, respondent charged an hourly fee for his  
  services, totaling approximately $41,000. Respondent received $17,418 of his total  
  fee. When his client refused to pay the balance, he filed suit against her in the  
  Chancery Court for Hamilton County, Tennessee. She, in turn, filed a counter-claim  
  alleging that respondent charged an excessive fee. After a jury trial, judgment was  
  rendered against respondent for charging an excessive fee, which the Court of  
  Appeals of Tennessee at Knoxville affirmed in 2004.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In February 2005, the Board of Professional Responsibility of the Supreme  
  Court of Tennessee publicly censured respondent for charging his client an excessive  
  fee, in violation of DR 2-106(A) of the Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ODC then filed a motion to initiate reciprocal discipline in Louisiana,  
  pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 21.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a> Attached to the
  motion was a certified  
  copy of the order of the Board of Professional Responsibility of the Supreme Court  
  of Tennessee filed March 4, 2005. On June 27, 2005, this court rendered an order  
  giving respondent thirty days to raise any claim, predicated upon the grounds set forth  
  in Rule XIX, § 21(D), that the imposition of identical discipline in Louisiana would  
  be unwarranted and the reasons for that claim. Respondent filed a timely response,  
  indicating he believes imposition of identical discipline in Louisiana would be  
  unwarranted.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Tennessee imposed a public censure on respondent for charging his client an  
  excessive fee in violation of DR 2-106(A). The equivalent Louisiana provision is  
  Rule <span class="Rules">1.5(a)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which provides, in pertinent part,  
  that "[a] lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable  
  fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses." The record reveals that respondent's  
  conduct constitutes a violation of this rule, warranting discipline in Louisiana.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy"><span class="cite">In re: Aulston, 05-1546 (La. 1/13/06), <a href="2006-01-13_2005-1546.htm">___
  So. 2d ___</a></span>, we held that "only under  
  extraordinary circumstances should there be a significant variance from the sanction  
  imposed by the other jurisdiction." Based on our review of the record, we find no  
  extraordinary circumstances are present which would compel a variance from the  
  Tennessee sanction.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we will impose reciprocal discipline pursuant to Supreme Court  
  Rule XIX, § 21. Because our rules do not provide for a public censure in bar  
  disciplinary cases, we will impose a public reprimand, which is the closest equivalent  
  available under our rules.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the motion for reciprocal discipline filed by the Office of  
  Disciplinary Counsel and the record filed herein, it is ordered that W. Eugene Jessup,  
  Louisiana Bar Roll number 17642, be publicly reprimanded.</p>
  <hr />

  <p><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> Reciprocal disciplinary proceedings were also instituted in
  Georgia, another state in which  
  respondent is admitted. In October 2005, the Supreme Court of Georgia imposed a formal  
  admonition upon respondent as reciprocal discipline.</p>
