  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 04-B-1990</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: CURKLIN ATKINS</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that
  respondent commingled funds, failed to promptly deliver funds to a third party upon receipt, failed to act with
  reasonable diligence and promptness in representing his clients, failed to communicate with his clients, failed to
  place funds advanced for costs and expenses in his trust account, failed to fulfill his obligations upon termination
  of the representation, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation.  Following the filing of formal
  charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent discipline.  Having reviewed the petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Curklin Atkins,
  Louisiana Bar Roll number 18769, be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of three years.  One
  year of this suspension shall be deferred, subject to respondent's successful completion of a oneyear period of
  probation governed by the conditions set forth in the petition for consent discipline. Any violation of the
  conditions of probation, or any other misconduct during the probationary period, may be grounds for making the
  deferred suspension executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
