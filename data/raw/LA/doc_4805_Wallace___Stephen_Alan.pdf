  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: STEPHEN ALAN WALLACE</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that
  respondent failed to promptly remit settlement funds to his client and practiced law while he was ineligible to do
  so. Prior to the filing of formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent discipline.
  Having reviewed the petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Stephen Alan Wallace,
  Louisiana Bar Roll number 24246, be suspended from the practice of law in Louisiana for a period of one year. It is
  further ordered that said suspension shall be fully deferred, subject to respondent's successful completion of a
  two-year period of probation governed by the conditions set forth in the petition for consent discipline.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
  in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of
  finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
