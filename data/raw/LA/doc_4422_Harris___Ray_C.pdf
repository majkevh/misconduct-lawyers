</span>This attorney disciplinary matter stems from one count of formal charges

Harris, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">UNDERLYING FACTS</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Respondent represented Robert 
Haynes in connection with a charge of burglary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On March 11, 1994, Mr. Haynes was 
convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Following the sentencing hearing, 
respondent advised Mr. Haynes he would handle his appeal on a pro bono basis, 
with the condition Mr. Haynes provide the costs of the trial transcripts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Four days later, on March 15, 1994, Mr. 
Haynes signed a written agreement which specified that he was responsible for 
the costs of all transcripts, copying, and binding fees in the amount of $1,200, 
to be paid in three $400 monthly installments.<a href="file:///G:/user/Temp/PendingSC/Harris,%20Ray%20C.%2000-B-1825.htm#_edn1" name="_ednref1" style="mso-endnote-id: edn1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">1</span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the contract stated that the 
payments were to be “made to Attorney Harris’ office and maintained there within 
my case file. . . .”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract 
further stated respondent would advise Mr. Haynes when all of the funds were 
received and would “thereafter file my appeal.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Approximately nine months later, 
on December 19, 1994, Mr. Haynes wrote to the clerk of court seeking to 
determine the status of his appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>The clerk advised that no appeal had been filed on his behalf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Several months later, on April 19, 1995, 
Mr. Haynes filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC, alleging neglect 
and lack of communication.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>Respondent filed an answer to the complaint, representing the delay 
stemmed from the court reporter’s failure to complete the trial transcripts and 
the trial court’s failure to complete the record.<a href="file:///G:/user/Temp/PendingSC/Harris,%20Ray%20C.%2000-B-1825.htm#_edn2" name="_ednref2" style="mso-endnote-id: edn2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">2</span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Based on this response, the ODC 
dismissed the complaint.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">On February 6, 1996, Mr. Haynes 
and his mother, Patricia Haynes, made the first payment of costs to 
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent sent a 
letter to Mrs. Haynes dated February 23, 1996, in which he indicated he spoke to 
the judge and expected to have the transcripts by March 1, 1996.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Mrs. Haynes continued to make 
periodic payments to respondent during the following year for a total of 
$1,100.<a href="file:///G:/user/Temp/PendingSC/Harris,%20Ray%20C.%2000-B-1825.htm#_edn3" name="_ednref3" style="mso-endnote-id: edn3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">3</span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent later admitted he did not 
place these funds in his client trust account, suggesting that he instead 
purchased money orders for each of the amounts as they were received and put 
them in his client’s file where, according to respondent, they remained for the 
entire period of the representation, as provided for in the agreement executed 
by Mr. Haynes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">At some point, Mrs. Haynes 
concluded from discussions with respondent that he waived the remaining $100 
balance and would complete the matter for the $1,100<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>amount he had already received.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, respondent failed to take any 
action in the matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result, 
on September 2, 1997, Mrs. Haynes filed a complaint with the ODC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In his response to the complaint, 
respondent contended “the appeal . . . has long been completed” and, when Mrs. 
Haynes paid him the balance of the funds, he would “take all steps possible to 
get Robert released from the Department of Corrections.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, respondent acknowledged 
the funds had never been kept in trust and, in contrast to his earlier statement 
that the appeal had been completed, respondent now stated that he would begin 
work on the appeal after he received the transcripts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">On November 21, 1997, the ODC 
filed formal charges against respondent alleging several violations of the Rules 
of Professional Conduct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The formal 
charges alleged respondent violated Rules 1.3 and 1.4 of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct by neglecting Mr. Haynes’ appeal and failing to keep him 
informed of the status of his appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>The charges further alleged respondent failed to place advanced costs in 
his trust account, as required by Rule 1.5.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the charges alleged respondent 
violated Rules 8.4(a) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct) and 8.4(d) 
(engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent filed an answer denying any 
intentional misconduct.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Shortly thereafter, respondent 
forwarded to Mr. Haynes two letters threatening civil action if he and his 
mother continued to pursue the disciplinary complaint and testify against 
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When confronted with the 
correspondence at Mr. Haynes’ deposition, respondent stated that he did not know 
his conduct was improper. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">In his deposition, Mr. Haynes 
testified as to respondent’s inaction in handling his case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He stated that after respondent agreed 
at the sentencing hearing to handle his appeal, he never saw him again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, he admitted the written 
agreement executed four days after the sentencing hearing evidenced his 
signature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ODC showed Mr. 
Haynes nine letters dated between February 6, 1996 (date of the first payment) 
and August 6, 1997 directed to him from respondent discussing the payments made 
and the balance of the costs due.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>Mr. Haynes recalled receiving some of the letters, and was unsure about 
the others.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">On July 22, 1998, a formal hearing 
was conducted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The parties 
stipulated to the basic underlying facts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>The ODC produced a written statement from the court reporter indicating 
she had never been asked for the total costs associated with transcribing Mr. 
Haynes’ case and, had she been asked, she would have charged a sum of $500.<a href="file:///G:/user/Temp/PendingSC/Harris,%20Ray%20C.%2000-B-1825.htm#_edn4" name="_ednref4" style="mso-endnote-id: edn4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">4</span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent testified he did not intend 
to order the transcripts until the full amount of the costs had been paid 
because he did not want to be “badgered” by the court for the funds in the event 
his client failed to provide payment prior to the completion of the 
transcripts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Regarding the letter 
to Mrs. Haynes dated February 23, 1996 stating he already ordered the 
transcripts, respondent testified his intention was to say that he would order 
the transcripts <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">in the future</span> 
when the balance of the costs were paid. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Respondent admitted the costs were 
not held in his trust account, but denied converting the funds to his own 
use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He alleged Mr. Haynes wanted 
the funds to be readily accessible in the event something happened to 
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent claimed that 
in an effort to comply with his client’s wishes, he immediately purchased money 
orders for the same amount when he received the payments and placed them in his 
client’s file, where they allegedly remained at all times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As evidence, respondent produced copies 
of seven money orders allegedly purchased in 1996 and 1997 that were taken from 
his client’s file.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He stated the 
originals were forwarded the day before the hearing via certified mail to Mrs. 
Haynes as full restitution at the request of ODC.<a href="file:///G:/user/Temp/PendingSC/Harris,%20Ray%20C.%2000-B-1825.htm#_edn5" name="_ednref5" style="mso-endnote-id: edn5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">5</span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because the copies of the money orders 
were blank and not dated, the record was left open at the conclusion of the 
hearing in order to obtain verification of respondent’s representations to the 
committee and the ODC.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">A few weeks after the hearing, the 
ODC obtained copies of the original money orders ultimately received by Mrs. 
Haynes.<a href="file:///G:/user/Temp/PendingSC/Harris,%20Ray%20C.%2000-B-1825.htm#_edn6" name="_ednref6" style="mso-endnote-id: edn6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">6</span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon recognizing that some of the money 
orders did not bear the same serial numbers as those submitted at the hearing, 
the ODC sought the assistance of the K&amp;B/Rite Aid Corporation, the issuer of 
the money orders, to obtain further information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although respondent claimed the money 
orders had already been mailed to Mrs. Haynes at the time of the formal hearing, 
the ODC discovered two of the money orders were in fact purchased <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">after</span> the hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, the money orders produced at 
the hearing were not purchased in 1996 and 1997, but rather in the spring of 
1998, including several on the day prior to the formal hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the ODC learned three of 
the money orders produced at the hearing were payable to the Louisiana State Bar 
Association, South Central Bell and respondent himself, respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">In light of its findings, the ODC 
sent respondent a letter on September 2, 1999, stating “[w]ithout a doubt, the 
money orders which you produced failed to support your testimony and in fact 
suggest that the testimony provided was false.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ODC indicated it was requesting that 
the hearing be reconvened for the purpose of taking additional testimony and 
indicated “[t]he purpose of this correspondence is to provide you with notice 
pursuant to Rule XIX of the allegations of misconduct so as to provide you with 
an opportunity to properly prepare.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">One month later, on October 2, 
1998, the hearing committee was reconvened and the parties stipulated to the 
ODC’s findings with respect to the money orders.<a href="file:///G:/user/Temp/PendingSC/Harris,%20Ray%20C.%2000-B-1825.htm#_edn7" name="_ednref7" style="mso-endnote-id: edn7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">7</span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent could not produce evidence to 
support his claims that he had forwarded any money orders by certified mail to 
Mrs. Haynes prior to the first hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>In an attempt to explain the inconsistencies with respect to the money 
orders, respondent tried to submit a copy of an affidavit allegedly executed by 
his sister.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the affidavit, 
respondent’s sister, who allegedly had been employed in his law office, stated 
she converted the original money orders purchased in 1996 and 1997 to her own 
use, and later purchased replacement money orders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>According to respondent, his sister died 
three days after executing the affidavit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>Respondent was the notary on the affidavit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent indicated he would not 
produce the two individuals who witnessed the affidavit, as they would be unable 
to testify to the document’s contents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The ODC objected to the 
admissibility of the affidavit as hearsay and the committee sustained the 
objection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The committee offered to 
let respondent proffer the copy of the affidavit on the condition he produce the 
original; however, he failed to do so.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The ODC filed a post-hearing brief 
proposing disbarment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent 
filed a brief denying any intentional misconduct and blaming his deceased sister 
for the money order discrepancies.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The hearing committee found the

failing to keep him informed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
committee found it was reasonable for respondent to expect his client to pay the 
costs in full prior to taking any action on the appeal, as provided by the 
written agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the 
committee noted the ODC failed to offer any precedent indicating it was improper 
for respondent to rely on his professional judgment in estimating the 
costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The committee placed great 
weight on respondent’s testimony that he spoke with and corresponded with his 
client and persons on his behalf regarding the cost payments. </p>

transcripts could have been started for $150, and by simple inquiry would have 
learned the entire cost of the transcripts would not have exceeded $500.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, respondent violated Rule <a href="file:///G:/user/Temp/PendingSC/Harris,%20Ray%20C.%2000-B-1825.htm#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=RULE1.4"></a> by failing to make any meaningful

harm to Mr. Haynes by delaying his appeal for over three years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He deprived Mr. Haynes and his mother of 
their funds for a lengthy period of time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>Respondent also made misleading statements to his client and the ODC, 
during its investigation of Mr. Haynes’ previous complaint, regarding the status 
of the appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sole mitigating 
factor is respondent’s lack of a prior disciplinary record.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, we conclude 
the appropriate sanction for respondent’s misconduct as alleged in the formal 
charges is a suspension from the practice of law for a period of eighteen 
months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this finding does 
not end the matter.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The most troubling aspect of this 
case is the alleged misconduct which occurred <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">after</span> the filing of formal charges, 
both with respect to the threatening letters respondent wrote to his client and 
the apparent misrepresentations made by respondent to the hearing committee 
regarding the money orders and the affidavit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In assessing this conduct, we must 
determine whether respondent’s post-formal charge conduct should be considered 
as an aggravating factor in connection with the original misconduct, or should 
be treated as separate and distinct misconduct.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Under the circumstances of this 
case, and in consideration of the interests of justice and due process, we 
believe this misconduct should be alleged by separate formal charges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We recognize that the ODC could not have 
anticipated respondent’s actions at the time it filed the formal charges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After the ODC concluded respondent made 
misrepresentations during the original hearing before the committee, it made an 
effort to inform respondent by letter that it would present these allegations 
when the hearing was reopened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>Nonetheless, we find the ODC’s letter is not an adequate substitute for 
the filing of formal charges pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § <a href="file:///G:/user/Temp/PendingSC/Harris,%20Ray%20C.%2000-B-1825.htm#!-- #LPAPP:SCRIPT_NAME --#?f=id&amp;id=r19s11">11</a>(E).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Without formal charges, there was

the fact that the hearing committee made no specific findings with regard to 
these allegations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the 
filing of formal charges alleging fairly serious misconduct at the original 
hearing may have caused respondent to re-evaluate his decision to represent 
himself at the subsequent hearing, and prompted him to hire separate 
counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under these facts, we 
conclude the most prudent course of action is to defer consideration of this 
conduct and remand the matter to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel to consider 
filing new formal charges.</p>

this time on respondent’s post-formal charge conduct, and remand the matter to 
the ODC for consideration of filing new formal charges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the event discipline is recommended

</span>Procedural due process requires notice and an opportunity to be 
heard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that 
disciplinary counsel in the present case provided respondent with notice of a 
hearing for additional testimony concerning the money orders, which from the 
information gathered by disciplinary counsel appear to have been fraudulently 
produced as manufactured evidence, and with an opportunity to prepare for the 
hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, respondent 
produced at the reconvened hearing a <u>copy</u> of an affidavit by his 
employee-sister in which she assumed the responsibility for the questionable 
money orders.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span>Nevertheless, this court’s requiring the issuance of separate formal 
charges for this extremely serious misconduct is appropriate in the present 
case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Hearing Committee, 
although finding respondent’s explanation for the inconsistencies in the money 
orders to be insufficient, recommended only a public reprimand, and the 
Disciplinary Board, after noting respondent’s negligent action in the 
safekeeping of the costs and “knowing, if not intentional,” false testimony, 
recommended only a six-month suspension and a period of probation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span>Because this court regards the presentation of false evidence as an 
extremely serious matter and because there may be questions surrounding the 
affidavit by respondent’s sister who died three days after its execution before 
him and two alleged witnesses, these matters should be fully aired after filing 
and service of formal charges setting out allegations of specific disciplinary 
violations. Additionally, although respondent did not choose to employ the 
assistance of counsel when he received the original formal charges, eh very well 
may have done so if he had been formally and specifically charged with the much 
more grievous conduct.</p>
