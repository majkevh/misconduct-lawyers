  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: MARTIN E. REGAN, JR.</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 00-DB-075</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of formal charges against the Respondent,
  Martin E. Regan, Jr., of New Orleans, Louisiana, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana.  For
  the reasons stated below, the Disciplinary Board orders that a public reprimand be issued against the Respondent.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Formal charges, consisting of two counts, were filed against the Respondent on June 12, 2000 by
  the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC").    In the charges, ODC alleges that the Respondent violated Rules of
  Professional Conduct 5.3(b) (failure to supervise a non-lawyer employee); 5.3(c)(1) (ordering a nonlawyer employee to
  perform acts that violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); 5.5(b) (assisting a non-lawyer in performing an
  activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law); 8.1(c) (failure to cooperate); 8.4(a) (violating and
  knowingly assisting another in violating the Rules of Professional Conduct) and 8.4(g) (failure to cooperate).  The
  Respondent filed his answer on July 24, 2000, after receiving two extensions of time in which to do so.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">A hearing before Hearing Committee Number Eleven was scheduled for November 29, 2000.  ODC filed
  a pre-hearing memorandum on November 17, 2000, and the Respondent filed a pre-hearing memorandum on November 20,
  2000.  The hearing was held as scheduled, and the hearing committee issued its report on March 6, 2001, finding a
  violation Rules 8.1(c) and 8.4(g) as alleged in Count II.  The committee dismissed all rule violations as alleged in
  Count I<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="" id="_ednref1">[i]</a>.  The committee recommended that the
  Respondent receive a public reprimand as his sanction.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's opinion on April 26, 2001, in which it argued
  that the hearing committee erred in failing to find that the rules specified in Count I had been violated. 
  Respondent filed a response to ODC's objection, maintaining that the hearing committee's decision should be affirmed
  by the Disciplinary Board.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Oral argument before Panel B of the Disciplinary Board was held on May 24, 2001.  Deputy
  Disciplinary Counsel James T. Daly appeared on behalf of ODC.  The Respondent and his counsel, Milton P. Masinter and
  Emily S. Morrison, also appeared.</p>

  <h3>THE FORMAL CHARGES</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The formal charges read, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <h4>"Count I</h4>

    <p>The Office of Disciplinary Counsel opened Investigative Matter No. 0007586, as a result of receipt of a copy of
    a deposition, in which Robert F. Monahan was participating.  Mr. Monahan was disbarred from the practice of law in
    1993, and is employed by Respondent as a non-lawyer paralegal.  On a number of occasions, in several different
    matters, Respondent has required and permitted this non-lawyer to attend and actively participate in a number of
    depositions.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="" id="_ednref2">[ii]</a>  Respondent's actions in this regard
    constitute failure to supervise a non-lawyer employee and assisting in the unauthorized practice of law.  The
    Office of Disciplinary Counsel notified Mr. Regan of the pendency of this complaint, which he received on May 7,
    1998.  Respondent answered the complaint by letter, admitted the actions complained of, but denied that these
    actions constituted violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  The actions of Respondent constitute failing
    to supervise a non-lawyer employee, in violation of Rule<span class="allegedrules"> 5.3(b)</span>; ordering a non-lawyer employee to perform acts
    that violate the rules, in violation of Rule <span class="allegedrules">5.3(c)(1)</span>; assisting a non-lawyer in performing an activity that
    constitutes the unauthorized practice of law, in violating of Rule 
	<span class="allegedrules">5.5(b)</span>; and, violating and knowingly assisting
    another in violating the Rules of Professional Conduct, in violation of Rule 
	<span class="allegedrules">8.4(a)</span> of the Rules of Professional
    Conduct.</p>

    <h4>Count II</h4>

    <p>Complaints have been filed against Mr. Regan by three complainants, Robert McDaniel (Investigative Matter No.
    0008041), Lakyia Skinner (Investigative Matter No. 0008423), and Salvador Ordonez (Investigative Matter No.
    0008470).  In each case, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel notified Mr. Regan of the complaint, via Certified
    Mail.  After receiving notification of the complaints, Mr. Regan failed to answer the complaints, which
    necessitated the issuance of three subpoenas.  The actions of Respondent constitute three counts of failure to
    cooperate with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel in its investigations, in violation of Rule 
	<span class="allegedrules">8.1(c)</span> and <span class="allegedrules">8.4(g)
	</span>of
    the Rules of Professional Conduct."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3><a   href="#!--%20#ID:00-DB-075.HC%20--#">THE HEARING COMMITTEE'S REPORT</a></h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">As noted above, the hearing committee issued its report on March 6, 2001, finding a violation
  Rules 8.1(c) and 8.4(g) as alleged in Count II.  The committee dismissed all rule violations as alleged in Count I. 
  The committee recommended that the Respondent receive a public reprimand as his sanction.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Violations Alleged in Count I</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As to the violation of Rule 5.3(b) (failure to supervise a non-lawyer employee), the committee
  found that the Respondent took "reasonable" actions and efforts to ensure that Mr. Monahan's appearance at
  depositions was compatible with the professional obligations of a lawyer under the circumstances and facts of the
  case.  These "reasonable efforts" included meeting with the other attorneys in his office about Mr. Monahan attending
  the depositions and concluding that that the practice was proper, as long as opposing counsel knew Mr. Monahan was a
  paralegal and did not object to his participation. The committee found that a violation of this rule was not
  established by clear and convincing evidence.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As to a violation of Rule 5.3(c)(1) (ordering a non-lawyer employee to perform acts that violate
  the rules), the committee found that although the Respondent instructed and had specific knowledge of Mr. Monahan's
  participation in the depositions for the firm, he took reasonable steps to determine whether such conduct was in
  violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Even though the Respondent was wrong, he believed the conditions he
  placed on Mr. Monahan's participation in the depositions were sufficient to comply with the rules.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The committee found that no violation of Rule 5.5(b) (assisting a non-lawyer in the unauthorized
  practice of law) was present either.  The committee determined that neither the Respondent nor Mr. Monahan knew that
  Mr. Monahan's actions constituted a violation of any of the Rules of Professional Conduct.    Finally, as to the Rule
  8.4(a) violation alleged under Count I, the committee found that the Respondent did not violate the Rules of
  Professional Conduct, knowingly induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Violations Alleged in Count II</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The committee found that the Respondent violated Rules 8.1(c) and 8.4(g) (failure to cooperate)
  when he failed to respond to complaints sent to him by Disciplinary Counsel even after he had been granted two
  extensions of time within which to reply.  The committee did not accept as an excuse the fact that the Respondent had
  been busy trying cases or the fact that the complaints ultimately were meritless. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In reaching its sanction determination, the committee found that the mitigating factors of
  character or reputation and remorse were present.  The committee also determined that the aggravating factors of
  prior disciplinary actions<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="" id="_ednref3">[iii]</a> and substantial
  experience in the practice of law<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="" id="_ednref4">[iv]</a> were present.  </p>

  <h3>OBJECTIONS TO THE HEARING COMMITTEE'S REPORT</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">As noted above, ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's opinion on April 26, 2001, in
  which it argued that the hearing committee erred in failing to find that the rules specified in Count I had been
  violated.  ODC Respondent filed a response to ODC's objection, maintaining that the hearing committee's decision be
  affirmed by the Disciplinary Board</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

  <h3>I.          The Standard Of Review</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">The powers and duties of the Disciplinary Board are defined in Section 2 of the Louisiana Supreme
  Court Rule XIX, Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement.  Subsection (G)(2)(a) states that the Board is "to perform
  appellate review functions, consisting of review of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of
  hearing committees with respect to formal charges . . . and prepare and forward to the court its own findings, if
  any, and recommendations."</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Inasmuch as the Board is serving in an appellate capacity, the standard of review applied to
  findings of fact is that of "manifest error."  <i>Arceneaux v. Domingue</i>, 365 So. 2d 1330 (La.1978); <i>Rosell v.
  ESCO</i>, 549 So. 2d 840 (La. 1989).  The Board conducts a <i>de novo</i> review of the hearing committee's
  application of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  <i>In re Hill</i>,
  <a href="1992-01-22_90-DB-004.htm">90-DB-004</a>.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">A review of the record in this matter indicates that the hearing committee's findings of fact are
  not manifestly erroneous.  However, a review of the committee's application of the Rules of Professional Conduct
  indicates that it improperly found that the rules as alleged in Count I were not proven by clear and convincing
  evidence. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">As pointed out by ODC, the finding that the Respondent did not violate Rules 5.3(b), 5.3(c)(1),
  and 5.5(b) was based on the erroneous premise that Respondent's conduct can be excused as a "mistake of law" or
  "ignorance of the law."  The Respondent claims that he did not know that sending Mr. Monahan to the depositions was
  prohibited under the law or the Rules of Professional Conduct.  He further argues that Rule 5.5(b) does not define
  what does and does not constitute the practice of law.  He also asserts that no reported disciplinary decisions
  existed at the time of the alleged misconduct which indicated that sending a paralegal to a deposition was prohibited
  under the rules.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="" id="_ednref5">[v]</a></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Court in <u>LSBA v. Thalheim</u>, <a  href="../SC/1987-04-06_1986-0822.htm">504
  So.2d 822</a>, 826 (La. 1987), specifically stated that ignorance of the disciplinary rules is no excuse and does
  little to mitigate misconduct in a disciplinary proceeding.   The Court has recently reiterated this proposition in
  <u>In re Kleinpeter</u>, 2000-1966 (La. 11/28/00); 
	<a href="../SC/2000-11-28_2000-1966.htm">774 So.2d 95</a>
  (ignorance of the disciplinary rules which set forth the minimum level of conduct below which no lawyer may fall
  without being subject to disciplinary action is no excuse) and <u>In re Jones</u>, 2000-1939 (La. 4/3/01);
  <a href="../SC/2001-04-03_2000-1939.htm">787 So.2d 271</a> (ignorance of disciplinary rules does not excuse a
  respondent's misconduct).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">While the Respondent is correct in his assertion that Rule 5.5(b) does not define what actions do
  and do not constitute the practice of law and that no reported cases dealing with similar misconduct existed at the
  time Mr. Monahan attended the depositions, the Board notes that LSA-R.S. 37:212 was in effect at the time Mr. Monahan
  attended the depositions.  This statute states in part that, "[t]he practice of law means and includes: (a) [i]n a
  representative capacity,  . . . the performance of any act in connection with pending or prospective proceedings
  before any court of record in this state."   Mr. Monahan's conduct at the depositions, which included his asking
  questions of witnesses and making objections, clearly constituted  "act[s] in connection with pending or prospective
  proceedings" before a court while in a representative capacity.  However, the Board finds that, while the Respondent
  did violate the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in Count I by sending Mr. Monahan to the depositions,
  Respondent's actions were negligent, and not intentional. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The Respondent also asserts that three other mitigating factors should be found by the Board,
  including <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest or selfish motive</span>, 
	<span class="ABAstandard">full and free disclosure to the discipline system</span>, and 
	<span class="ABAstandard">personal
  problems</span>.  Two of these factors are supported by the record-absence of a dishonest or selfish motive and personal
  problems.  No evidence can be found in the record to indicate any dishonest or selfish motive on the part of the
  Respondent.  Moreover, the Respondent's testimony before the hearing committee indicated that he has three children
  who are terminally ill with muscular dystrophy.  All three children are cared for at home with a staff of nurses,
  physical therapists and housekeepers.  Twenty-four hour care is provided at significant cost.  Respondent testified
  that he would never do anything to intentionally jeopardize his law license as his three children depend upon him for
  their medical care.  Based on the above, the Board will find that the mitigating factors of absence of a dishonest or
  selfish motive and personal problems are present.   The Board declines to find that the mitigating factor of full and
  free disclosure to the discipline system exists here because of Respondent's failure to promptly respond to the
  complaints described in Count II.</p>

  <h3>II.  Application of Factors To Be Considered In Imposing Sanctions</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the
    profession;</p>

    <p>(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p>(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p>(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">In the matter at hand, the Respondent has violated his duty owed to the profession.  His conduct
  was negligent.  While no evidence of actual injury to the profession is described in the record as to Count I, the
  potential for injury is present.  The Respondent allowed Mr. Monahan to attend and participate in depositions from
  January of 1997 until September of 1997.  Mr. Monahan appeared at depositions for the firm approximately twenty
  times.  As to Count II, actual injury to the profession and disciplinary system occurred because of the Respondent's
  failure to initially respond to the disciplinary complaints filed against him.  Respondent's actions unjustly delayed
  the disciplinary process and caused subpoenas to be issued for him to appear and give a response.  The issuance of
  these subpoenas imposed an additional burden upon the disciplinary system. </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The aggravating factors of <span class="ABAstandard">prior discipline</span> and 
	<span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in the practice of law</span> are
  present here.  The mitigating factors of <span class="ABAstandard">character or reputation</span>,
	<span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>, <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest or selfish motive</span>
  and <span class="ABAstandard">personal problems</span> are also present.</p>

  <h3>III.  The ABA Standards</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">Given the facts of this case, Standards 
	<span class="ABAstandard">7.3</span> and <span class="ABAstandard">7.2</span> of the <i>ABA Standards for</i> <i>Imposing
  Lawyer Sanctions</i> warrant review.   Standard 7.3 provides for reprimand "when a lawyer negligently engages in
  conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional, and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the
  public, or the legal system."   The comments to this standard state that "[c]ourts also impose reprimands on lawyers
  who are negligent in supervising their employees," and "usually there is little or no injury to the client, the
  public, or the legal system, and the purposes of lawyer discipline will be best served by imposing a public sanction
  that helps educate the respondent lawyer and deter future violations." </p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Standard 7.2 provides for suspension "when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a
  violation of a duty owed as a professional, and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, or the
  legal system."  The comments to this standard state that "suspension is appropriate when the lawyer knowingly
  violates a duty owed to the profession and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, or the legal
  system, even when a lawyer does not intentionally abuse the professional relationship by engaging in deceptive
  conduct."</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Because the Board finds that the Respondent's conduct was negligent and that the harm to the
  profession and the disciplinary system was minimal, Standard 7.3 appears to be the more appropriate standard to apply
  in this matter.</p>

  <h3>IV.       Applicable Case law</h3>

  <p class="bodycopy">As discussed earlier, the Court first addressed the issue of a non-lawyer's participation in a
  deposition in <span class="cite"> <u>In re Jones</u>, 98-0207 (La. 3/27/98); <a  href="../SC/1998-03-27_1998-0207.htm">708
  So.2d 413</a></span>.  In <u>Jones</u>, the charges arose from two instances of unauthorized practice of law during the time
  Mr. Jones was ineligible to practice law.  On one occasion, the respondent participated as a lawyer in a deposition
  in connection with a civil lawsuit.  On the second occasion, the respondent submitted a trial brief in connection
  with another civil matter.  <u>Id.</u> at 413-14.  Jones had previously received two admonitions; one issued in 1996
  for his participation in one of the civil suits while ineligible to practice law and the other issued in 1995 for
  filing three motions to recuse judges within the context of litigation without a good faith basis to do so. 
  <u>Id.</u> at 415.  The Court imposed a suspension from the practice of law for a period of one year and one day,
  with six months deferred, followed by a period of probation.  <u>Id.</u></p>

  <p class="bodycopy">In  <span class="cite"> <u>In re Cline</u>, 99-2779 (La. 2/20/00); <a href="../SC/2000-02-29_1999-2779.htm">756 So.2d
  284</a></span>, the Court again addressed the issue of an attorney's failure to properly supervise a non-lawyer employee. 
  In that matter, the respondent allowed his client to take settlement checks to her previous attorney's office for his
  endorsement.  The checks later turned up forged.  The Court opined that the respondent failed to take minimal steps
  to ensure that the checks were properly transmitted to her prior attorney and deviated from his normal office
  procedures.  Court reasoned that in such a situation the baseline sanction for a respondent's failure to supervise a
  non-lawyer would ordinarily be a public reprimand; however, in that case, the respondent's prior disciplinary record
  justified an upward deviation from this baseline sanction.  In fact, Mr. Cline had been previously admonished for
  what the Court described as "strikingly similar" misconduct which involved another forged signature.  A six month
  suspension, with three months deferred, followed by two years of supervised probation, was imposed.   <u>Id.</u>  at
  289-90.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Further, in <span class="cite"> <u>In re Williams</u>, <a href="2001-06-21_00-DB-128.htm">00-DB-128</a> (Disc. Bd.
  Op. 6/21/01)</span>, the Disciplinary Board issued a public reprimand to an attorney who failed to supervise a suspended
  attorney who was working as a paralegal in his office.  On one occasion, the suspended attorney sent correspondence
  to an individual which gave the impression that he was a practicing attorney.  No clients were harmed by the
  misconduct.  <u>Id.</u> at 3-4.  Mr. Williams also failed to cooperate with ODC in its investigation of two matters,
  leading to issuance of two subpoenas in order to obtain information from him.  Mr. Williams had no prior disciplinary
  record.  <u>Id.</u> at 2-3.  <span class="cite"> <u>See</u> <u>also</u> <u>In re Gold</u>, 98-2819 (La. 4/30/99); <a 
  href="../SC/1998-04-30_1998-2819.htm">734 So.2d 1210</a></span> (public reprimand imposed for five counts of failure to
  cooperate involving failure to respond to complaints and failure to respond to ODC's subpoenas).</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">The conduct in this matter is not as egregious as that described in <u>Jones</u>.  Unlike Mr.
  Regan, Mr. Jones had clearly been warned by ODC (through the motion for admonition filed three months prior to
  conduct which formed the basis of his formal charges leading to suspension) that his conduct would be construed as a
  violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  Jones continued his misconduct, practicing law on two more occasions
  while ineligible to do so.  Notably, Mr. Jones received an admonition for his first instance of engaging in the
  unauthorized practice of law in 1996, even though he had a prior disciplinary record of an admonition issued in 1995
  for filing three meritless motions to recuse judges.  Unlike Mr. Jones, Mr. Regan immediately ceased the questionable
  conduct at issue when he was notified by ODC that possible rule violations existed.  Consequently, the sanction
  imposed in <u>Jones</u> is too harsh a sanction to impose upon Mr. Regan.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Similar to the respondent in <u>Cline</u>, Mr. Regan also has prior discipline   However, Mr.
  Regan's prior discipline involved his failure to properly supervise an associate attorney regarding the return of a
  file, not his failure to supervise a non-lawyer employee at a deposition.   The sanction imposed in <u>Cline</u> is
  also too harsh.  Instead, the Board finds that this matter is more akin to the <u>Williams</u> matter.  In
  <u>Williams</u>, as here, the respondent failed to supervise his paralegal, who gave the impression that he was a
  practicing attorney.  Like the matter at bar, no specific client harm was discovered.  The <u>Williams</u> case also
  involved two instances of failure to cooperate with the disciplinary process.  Based upon the numerous mitigating
  factors present, and following the guidance of the <u>Williams</u> case, the Board determines that a public reprimand
  is the appropriate sanction in this matter.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the hearing committee's report be modified to include
  violations of Rules of Professional Conduct 5.3(b), 5.3(c)(1), 5.5(b), and 8.4(a).  The Board further orders that a
  public reprimand be issued against the Respondent, Martin E. Regan, Jr., and that he be assessed with all costs and
  expenses of these proceedings in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10.1.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="" id="_edn2">[ii]</a> The record in this matter
  reveals that the Respondent allowed Mr. Monahan to attend approximately twenty depositions during the time period of
  January 1997 until September 1997.  At the depositions, Mr. Monahan participated both by making objections and asking
  questions.  On one occasion an attorney did object to Mr. Monahan asking questions and, on that occasion, an attorney
  from the firm immediately appeared at the depostion to conduct the questioning.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext">The record also reveals that prior to using Mr. Monahan at the depositions, the idea was
  discussed at the firm's regular Saturday meeting of attorneys and the attorneys came to the conclusion that there
  would be no legal or ethical problem with this practice as long as the opposing attorney knew Mr. Monahan was a
  paralegal.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref3" name="_edn3" title="" id="_edn3">[iii]</a> The record indicates that the
  Respondent received an admonition in 1997 for failure to supervise an associate attorney in his office concerning the
  return of a client's file.  The associate kept part of the file in a file cabinet in his office, rather than in the
  firm's central filing system.  When the Respondent's law firm withdrew from the case, the entire file was not sent to
  the former client's new counsel.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref4" name="_edn4" title="" id="_edn4">[iv]</a> The Respondent was admitted to

  <p class="footnotetext"><a href="#_ednref5" name="_edn5" title="" id="_edn5">[v]</a> The first case issued by the
  Louisiana Supreme Court which held that a non-lawyer's participation in a depositions constitutes the unauthorized
