  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE"> LOUISIANA ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY BOARD</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE:  WILLARD JAMES BROWN, SR.</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 00-DB-016</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD<b>  </b></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based on the filing of a Joint Petition for Consent Discipline
  by Willard James Brown, Sr., (herein "Respondent") of Gretna, Louisiana, and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  (herein "ODC"). For the reasons stated below, the Board accepts the Petition and will issue a public reprimand
  against the Respondent.</p>

  <h2><b>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On February 7, 2000, ODC filed formal charges, consisting of one count, against the Respondent.
  The charges allege that the Respondent violated Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"
  class="fn" id="_ednref1">[i]</a>, 1.4(a)<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" class="fn" id="_ednref2">[ii]</a> and
  1.15(b)<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" class="fn" id="_ednref3">[iii]</a> in connection with his representation of Mr.
  Vernon Orange.  The Respondent answered the formal charges on June 20, 2000, denying the allegations as they
  pertained to violations of Rules 1.3 and 1.4, but admitting that he retained the settlement funds in the client's
  trust account for a period of nine months following the settlement.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">A hearing before Hearing Committee Number 13 was scheduled for August 22, 2000. 
  Prior to the hearing, the parties agreed to enter into a Joint Petition for Consent Discipline, and the hearing was
  continued.  The Joint Petition for Consent Discipline was filed on September 19, 2000.  The parties submit that a
  public reprimand is the appropriate sanction.  On December 14, 2000, a panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this
  matter. Deputy Disciplinary Counsel James T. Daly represented the ODC. Respondent waived his appearance.</p>

  <h2><b>FORMAL CHARGES</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  The formal charges in this matter read as follows: </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">  "The Office of the Disciplinary Counsel received a complaint from Vernon Orange who had
  retained the Respondent to represent him in Federal Court in a suit for damages. According to the allegations of the
  Complainant, supported by documentation, during the course of the representation the Respondent failed to communicate
  sufficiently with his client to keep him reasonably informed. Prior to the trial, Respondent failed to file the
  necessary pre-trial inserts, thus limiting his client's ability to call witnesses and submit evidence at trial. Once
  a settlement was reached, the Respondent withheld his client's portion of the funds for some nine months before
  delivering the funds to his client. The actions and omissions by the Respondent constitute lack of diligence, failure
  to keep his client informed, and failure to promptly turn over client funds, in violation of Rules
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span>, <span class="allegedrules">1.4(a)</span>, and
  <span class="allegedrules">1.15(b)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct."</p>

  <h2><b>STIPULATED FACTS</b> </h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Stipulated Facts filed with the Joint Petition for Consent Discipline provide the
  following: </p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In August of 1997, the complainant, Mr. Orange, retained the Respondent to represent
  him in a claim for damages against the Sheriff of St. Tammany Parish.  The matter was filed in the U.S. District
  Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.  Respondent did not file pre-trial inserts on behalf of his client prior
  to the pretrial conference, as required, because the client had failed to provide the names of his witnesses, and the
  Respondent believed that all of his client's documentary evidence was already in the record.  As a result, had this
  matter gone to trial, Mr. Orange would have been limited in his ability to call witnesses and introduce evidence.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The matter later was compromised before trial for the sum of $500.00.  Prior to this
  settlement being accepted by Mr. Orange, the Respondent did not inform him that after the expenses and attorneys fee
  were withheld, he would only receive approximately $55.00 from the total settlement.  In fact, it was some weeks
  later before Mr. Orange was made aware of this fact.  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Orange filed his complaint with ODC. 
  The Respondent cooperated in the investigation of this complaint; however, sufficient evidence of misconduct was
  obtained to support the filing of formal charges.  Mr. Orange was paid his portion of the settlement during the
  course of the investigation of the complaint.</p>

  <h2> <b>PETITION FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy"> In the Joint Petition for Consent Discipline, the parties state that the baseline sanction for
  the above-described misconduct is a public reprimand.  The mitigating factors include absence of a prior disciplinary
  record and remorse.</p>

  <h2> <b>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Respondent and ODC have agreed that Respondent has violated Rules 1.3, 1.4(a), and 1.15(b) of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct.  The Board must accept that Respondent has violated these rules.  <span class="cite"> <i>In re
  Lieberman</i>, 95-2628 (La. 6/7/96); <a href="../SC/1996-06-07_1995-2628.htm">675 So. 2d 272</a></span>. Given these violations, the Board is left to determine if the
  proposed sanction of public reprimand is appropriate. Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Section 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a
  finding of lawyer misconduct, the Court or Board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>

  <p class="inverted">1)  whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the profession;</p><p class="inverted">2)  whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p><p class="inverted">3)  the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>
  <p class="inverted">4)  the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p></blockquote>


  <p class="Bodycopy">The record supports the conclusion that Respondent negligently violated duties owed to his client
  and that his actions caused injury to his client, including, without limitation, the inability to properly present
  plaintiff's case at trial, which exacerbated the need to settle for a minimal amount and the loss of use of the
  settlement funds.  The record further supports a finding that the sole mitigating factors are the
  <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a prior disciplinary record</span> and
  <span class="ABAstandard">remorse</span>.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" class="fn" id="_ednref4">[iv]</a> Based upon
  the documents filed in this matter, there are no aggravating factors present.<b> </b></p>

  <h2><b>ANALYSIS</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Louisiana Supreme Court relies on the ABA's <i>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i> to
  determine the baseline sanction.  The standards require consideration of "the type of duty violated, the lawyer's
  mental state and the extent of the injury caused".  The Standards then require an adjustment to the sanction in
  accordance with the aggravating and mitigating factors present."  <span class="cite"> <i>In re Quaid</i>, 94-1316 (La. 11/30/94); <a href="../SC/1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So.
  2d 343</a>, 350</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The ABA Standards suggest that a reprimand is the appropriate sanction.  Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.43</span> provides that a "reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent
  and does not act with reasonable diligence in representing a client, and causes injury or potential injury to a
  client."  Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.13</span> suggests "reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer
  is negligent in dealing with client property and causes injury or potential injury to a client."  Here, Respondent
  acted negligently in representing his client by, among other things, failing to adequately prepare the Pretrial
  Order.  Respondent also acted negligently in dealing with the settlement funds and failing to remit them to his
  client.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The recent case of <span class="cite"> <i>In re Brown</i>, <a href="2000-06-13_00-DB-047.htm">00-DB-047</a> (Bd. Op., 7/31/2000)</span>, provides further support
  for the conclusion that a reprimand is the appropriate sanction.  There, the respondent had received the client's
  file from his former associate who had been handling the matter for several years.  Thereafter, the respondent failed
  to take any steps to pursue the case or to keep the client informed as to the case's status for over a year.  Upon
  considering the aggravating factors, which included substantial experience in the practice of law and the mitigating
  factor of the absence of a prior disciplinary record, the respondent was issued a public reprimand for violations of
  Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3 and 1.4(a).  Bd. Op. at 2-3.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Similarly, in <span class="cite"> <i>In re Laiche</i>, <a href="1999-07-15_98-DB-057.htm">98-DB-057</a> (Bd. Op., 7/15/99)</span>, respondent was alleged to have
  filed a personal injury suit and thereafter failed to prosecute it for eight years.  Respondent also was alleged to
  have failed to keep his clients informed as to the progress or lack of progress of the case; failed to timely inform
  his clients of a settlement offer, which he rejected without consulting his clients; failed to return a file; and
  failed to timely sign a motion to substitute counsel to clients who had discharged him.   <i>Id.</i> at 1-2.   The
  only aggravating factor was respondent's substantial experience in the practice of law. Mitigating factors included
  the absence of a disciplinary record, no dishonest or selfish motive, a timely good faith effort to rectify the
  misconduct, and lack of harm to the clients.  <i>Id.</i> at 2.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After the respondent admitted to violating Rules <span class="Rules">1.3</span>,
  <span class="Rules">1.4</span> and <span class="Rules">l.16 (d)</span>, the parties filed a joint motion for consent
  discipline proposing a public reprimand as the appropriate discipline.  Bd. Op. at 1.  The Board accepted the joint
  petition, ordering that a public reprimand be given and that he be assessed with all costs and expenses of the
  proceedings.  <i>Id.</i> at 3.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Similar to <i>Brown</i> and <i>Laiche,</i> Respondent here neglected a client matter and failed
  to keep his client adequately informed.  Like, <i>Brown</i> and <i>Laiche</i>, little, if any, actual client injury
  appears to be present here.  Accordingly, as in <i>Brown</i> and <i>Laiche</i>, a public reprimand is the appropriate
  sanction. </p>

  <h2><b>RULING</b></h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on the foregoing, it is ordered that the Petition For Consent Discipline be accepted, and
  that a public reprimand be issued against the Respondent, Willard James Brown, Sr., for his violations of the Rules
  of Professional Conduct. It is further ordered that the Respondent be assessed the costs and expenses of these
  proceedings, with legal interest to commence running thirty days from the date of finality of this Ruling until
  paid.</p>
