  <p class="headingstyle">NO. 04-B-1365</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">IN RE: MARTIN E. REGAN, JR.</p>

  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM <a name="fnref_" class="fn" href="#fn_" id="fnref_">*</a></p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
  ("ODC") against respondent, Martin E. Regan, Jr., an attorney licensed to practice law in Louisiana.</p>

  <h2>STIPULATED FACTS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The following facts are not in dispute, having been stipulated to by respondent and the ODC:</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">On January 21, 1995, Leonard Chase, II retained respondent's law firm to represent him in a
  personal injury claim against the New Orleans Police Department and the City of New Orleans. On October 2, 1995, a
  petition for damages was prepared and filed on behalf of Mr. Chase by respondent or a member of his firm. Leonard
  Chase v. New Orleans Police Dept., et al., No. 95-14810 on the docket of the Orleans Parish Civil District Court. The
  petition specified that service of citation be withheld. By letter to the clerk of court dated December 30, 1996,
  respondent requested that service of citation be effected. However, respondent took no steps to determine whether
  service was, in fact, made in accordance with this request. By letter dated February 28, 2000, respondent again
  requested service of the petition and enclosed a check in the amount of $30 to cover the cost thereof. Service was
  ultimately made on both defendants on March 27, 2000. On April 2, 2001, Mr. Chase's lawsuit was dismissed as
  abandoned on an ex parte motion of the City of New Orleans. Respondent did not challenge the dismissal of the suit,
  nor has he made any attempt to have the suit reinstated.</p>

  <h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In March 2000, Mr. Chase filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC. On September 10,
  2002, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against respondent, alleging that he violated Rule
  <span class="allegedrules">1.3</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct by failing to act with reasonable
  diligence and promptness in the Chase matter. Respondent answered the formal charges and admitted the factual
  allegations therein, but given the circumstances of the particular case, denied that his conduct violated the Rules
  of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">This matter proceeded to a formal hearing on the merits, which was conducted by the hearing
  committee on October 17, 2003. In his testimony, respondent explained that he did not pursue Mr. Chase's lawsuit
  because he concluded that it was "fraudulent" and without merit.1 Respondent could not reach Mr. Chase to advise him
  of his decision, but rather than withdrawing from the case, he simply took no action to prosecute the suit filed in
  October 1995. Respondent had no further contact with his client until Mr. Chase appeared in respondent's office on
  February 19, 2000. After respondent informed Mr. Chase that his suit was "dead," Mr. Chase requested his file and
  discharged respondent. Respondent testified that in his view, Mr. Chase suffered no injury by the dismissal of his
  suit; rather, respondent asserted that it was he who was injured, given that his firm expended a considerable amount
  of time and money ($803 in costs, as well as the salaries of his legal staff) on the "bogus" case.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2004-01-13_02-db-098.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering the stipulated facts, as well as the testimony adduced at the hearing, the hearing
  committee determined that respondent failed to use reasonable diligence in his representation of Mr. Chase.
  Accordingly, the committee agreed that respondent violated Rule 1.3 of the Rules of Professional Conduct as charged
  in the formal charges. It found respondent violated duties owed to his client and to the legal profession, and his
  failure to fulfill his duty to Mr. Chase was knowing and willing, resulting in Mr. Chase's suit being dismissed on
  grounds of abandonment. The committee determined the baseline sanction for respondent's misconduct is a suspension
  from the practice of law.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the committee recognized respondent's prior disciplinary
  offenses,<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a> dishonest or selfish motive, and substantial
  experience in the practice of law (admitted 1975). The committee also felt that respondent had not demonstrated
  sufficient remorse and indicated that it would "draw an inference against Respondent" as to his good character and
  reputation because there is no evidence of such in the record.<a name="fnref3" class="fn" href="#fn3"
  id="fnref3">3</a> In mitigation, the committee acknowledged respondent's personal and family
  problems,<a name="fnref4" class="fn" href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a> as well as his cooperative attitude toward the
  disciplinary proceeding.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Considering all the facts of this case, the committee recommended that respondent be suspended
  from the practice of law for a period of one year. The committee further recommended that the suspension be deferred
  in full on the condition that respondent complete a minimum of eight additional hours of continuing legal education
  in the area of law practice management.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC objected to the sanction recommended by the hearing committee;
  however, respondent did object to the committee's application of the aggravating and mitigating factors.</p>

  <h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2004-06-03_02-DB-098.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>

  <p class="Bodycopy">After reviewing this matter, the disciplinary board concurred in the hearing committee's factual
  findings and application of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Like the committee, the board found respondent
  violated duties owed to his client, Mr. Chase, and to the profession. It recognized his actions were knowing and
  caused injury to Mr. Chase in that his suit was dismissed on grounds of abandonment before he had an opportunity to
  have his day in court.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Although it agreed with the committee's factual findings, the board largely rejected the hearing
  committee's analysis of the aggravating and mitigating factors.<a name="fnref5" class="fn" href="#fn5"
  id="fnref5">5</a>  The board found the record supports the following aggravating factors:
  <span class="ABAstandard">prior disciplinary offenses</span> and <span class="ABAstandard">substantial experience in
  the practice of law</span>. In mitigation, the board acknowledged the <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a
  dishonest or selfish motive</span>, respondent's <span class="ABAstandard">personal problems</span>, and his
  <span class="ABAstandard">cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceeding</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Turning to the issue of an appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct, the board noted the
  baseline sanction is suspension under the ABA's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions.<a name="fnref6" class="fn"
  href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a> The court's prior jurisprudence in cases involving the neglect of a legal matter which
  results in a client's case being dismissed on grounds of abandonment suggests that the suspension generally ranges
  from six months to one year and one day, perhaps with all or part of the suspension deferred. The board cited several
  such cases, specifically noting the similarity of <span class="cite">In re: Holmes, 03-1959 (La. 9/19/03),
  <a href="2003-09-19_2003-1959.htm">855 So. 2d 736</a></span>, and <span class="cite">In re: Dunn, 98-0535 (La.
  6/5/98), <a href="1998-06-05_1998-0535.htm">713 So. 2d 461</a></span>, to the instant case. The board acknowledged
  that the sanction recommended by the hearing committee is consistent with these authorities. Nonetheless, the board
  concluded that it is appropriate to deviate downward from the committee's proposed sanction, "because of the
  mitigating factors present and because of the frivolous nature of Mr. Chase's lawsuit."</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Based on this reasoning, the board recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of
  law for six months, to be deferred in full on the condition that respondent complete a minimum of eight additional
  hours of continuing legal education in the area of law practice management. The board also noted that any misconduct
  occurring during a six-month period following the finality of the court's6 order should be grounds for making the
  deferred period of suspension executory. Finally, the board recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs
  and expenses of these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's recommendation.</p>

  <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. La. Const. art. V,
  § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether
  the alleged misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 94-1316
  (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a>, 348</span>; <span class="cite">Louisiana State
  Bar Ass'n v. Boutall, <a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a>, 445 (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not
  bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held
  the manifest error standard is applicable to the committee's factual findings. See <span class="cite">In re:
  Caulfield, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96), <a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>;
  <span class="cite">In re: Pardue, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 2d
  150</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">In the instant case, the stipulated facts support a finding that respondent neglected Mr. Chase's
  legal matter, resulting in the dismissal of his suit on grounds of abandonment, in violation of Rule
  <span class="Rules">1.3</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional misconduct, we now turn to a discussion of an appropriate sanction. In
  considering that issue, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of
  conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct.
  <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Reis, <a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La.
  1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses
  involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar
  Ass'n v. Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The record demonstrates respondent's actions were knowing and caused injury to Mr. Chase.
  Respondent owed his client a duty to move his lawsuit forward with reasonable diligence and promptness. He failed to
  do so, and failed to promptly inform Mr. Chase of his decision that he would not pursue the litigation. As a result
  of respondent's inaction, Mr. Chase's suit was dismissed as abandoned. The baseline sanction for this misconduct is a
  suspension from the practice of law ranging from six months to one year and one day, which may be fully or partially
  deferred.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Several mitigating factors are present in this case, including the
  <span class="ABAstandard">absence of a dishonest or selfish motive</span>, respondent's personal problems during the
  time of the misconduct, and his cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceeding. Taken as a whole, the record
  supports the conclusion that respondent's mishandling of Mr. Chase's case was not intentional, but stemmed in large
  part from poor office management.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Accordingly, we find the appropriate sanction for respondent's misconduct is a suspension from
  the practice of law for a period of six months. In light of the mitigating factors, we will defer that suspension in
  its entirety, and place respondent on unsupervised probation for a period of six months, subject to the condition
  that respondent obtain eight hours of CLE in the area of law practice management, in addition to his ordinary CLE
  obligations, during the probationary period. Any failure of respondent to comply with this condition, or any
  misconduct during the probationary period, may be grounds for making the deferred suspension executory, or imposing
  additional discipline, as appropriate.</p>

  <h2>DECREE</h2>

  <p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and disciplinary board,
  and considering the record, it is ordered that Martin Edward Regan, Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 11153, be
  suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months. It is further ordered that said suspension shall be
  fully deferred and respondent shall be placed on unsupervised probation for a period of six months, subject to the
  condition that during the probationary period, he complete a minimum of eight credit hours of continuing legal
  education in the area of law practice management, in addition to his regular mandatory continuing legal education
  requirements. Respondent's failure to comply with this condition, or any misconduct during the probationary period,
  may be grounds for making the deferred suspension executory, or imposing additional discipline, as appropriate. All
  costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1,
  with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1" id="fn1">1</a> According to Mr. Chase, he was injured
  in a violent, unprovoked attack upon him by the police as he left the Orleans Parish Prison after posting bond on a
  DWI charge. However, when respondent reviewed Mr. Chase's medical records for the first time in early 1997, he
  learned that Mr. Chase was in custody when he was transported to Charity Hospital directly from the psychiatric unit
  of the Orleans Parish Prison. The medical records also reflect that Mr. Chase's mental status was "altered" upon
  arrival in the emergency room, and contain no indication that he had any injuries consistent with a recent beating.
  The inconsistencies in Mr. Chase's story, coupled with the fact that the New Orleans Police Department had no
  officers on duty in the Orleans Parish Prison, led respondent to conclude that Mr. Chase's claim of injury by the
  police was not legitimate.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2" id="fn2">2</a> In 2002, respondent was publicly
  reprimanded by the disciplinary board for permitting his paralegal, who is a disbarred lawyer, to attend and actively
  participate in approximately twenty depositions over a nine-month period (00-DB-075). In 1997, respondent was
  admonished by the disciplinary board for failing to supervise office personnel who had not returned all of a client's
  file upon the termination of the representation (97-ADB-033).</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3" id="fn3">3</a> The disciplinary board later rejected
  the committee's "presumption" of bad character. See infra note 5. We agree with the board that the committee's
  analysis is in error. While good character may be proved as a mitigating factor, there is no negative inference if a
  respondent fails to produce such evidence.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4" class="fn" href="#fn4" id="fn4">4</a> Respondent's wife died of cancer in
  January 1996. During her illness, respondent's health insurer canceled his policy and respondent had to pay for all
  of his wife's medical treatment out of his own pocket. Respondent also has three major children who suffer from
  muscular dystrophy, one of whom also suffers from mental retardation. The children are cared for around the clock in
  respondent's home at great financial expense to respondent.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn5" class="fn" href="#fnref" id="fn5">5</a> The board correctly noted that (1) no
  presumption of bad character or reputation should be drawn from a respondent's failure to produce evidence of good
  character or reputation; (2) respondent did not fail to demonstrate remorse or otherwise refuse to acknowledge the
  wrongful nature of his conduct, as he admitted at the hearing that he should have handled Mr. Chase's case
  differently; and (3) respondent was not prompted to neglect Mr. Chase's case by any dishonest or selfish motive.</p>

  <p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn6" class="fn" href="#fnref6" id="fn6">6</a> Standard <span class="ABAstandard">4.42</span> suggests that suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for a client and causes injury or potential injury to a client. 
  Respondent's knowing inaction in Mr. Chase's legal matter caused injury to his client, whose case was abandoned. Likewise, Standard <span class="ABAstandard">7.2</span> suggests that suspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly
  engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed to the profession, and causes injury or potential injury to a
  client, the public, or the legal system. By failing to properly handle Mr. Chase's legal matter, respondent also
  violated his duty as a professional, and caused injury to his client.</p>
