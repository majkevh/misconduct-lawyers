<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NO. 01-B-2720</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE: SPENCER W. KIMBALL, II</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="HEADINGSTYLE">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This attorney disciplinary proceeding arises from seven counts of formal 
charges filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, 
Spencer W. Kimball, II<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a>, an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of 
Louisiana,&nbsp; 
but currently on interim suspension.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<h3>Count I</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">On November 26, 1996, Antonio McGee retained respondent for $700 to 
represent his friend in a criminal matter. Subsequently, respondent failed to 
take any 
measures on behalf of his client, failed to communicate with the client or Mr. 
McGee 
and failed to return the unearned fee, despite repeated requests.</p>
<h3>Count II</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In 1995 or 1996, Barry Alveris retained respondent for $125 to obtain a 
special 
commission card from the New Orleans Police Department. Subsequently, 
respondent failed to take any action on behalf of his client and failed to 
respond to his 
client’s requests for information.</p>
<h3>Count III</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Janell Watson retained respondent for $283.88 to represent her son, who was

any measures on behalf of his client, failed to communicate with the client or 
Ms. 
Williams and failed to return the unearned fee, despite Ms. Williams’ repeated

<h3>Count V</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In October 1997, Elliott Sanders retained respondent for $300 to represent 
him 
at a criminal hearing. Subsequently, respondent failed to appear at the hearing, 
thus, 
placing his client in danger of being incarcerated. Respondent failed to take 
any action 
on behalf of his client and failed to reply to his client’s requests for 
information. 
Although Mr. Sanders wrote to respondent discharging him from the representation 
and seeking the return of the unearned fee, respondent failed to respond to the 
correspondence.</p>
<h3>Count VI</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">On January 2, 1998, Cindy Stevenson retained respondent for $300 to represent 
her husband, who was incarcerated, at a bond reduction hearing. Respondent 
failed 
to appear at the hearing and failed to take any measures on behalf of his 
client. He 
failed to communicate with the client or Mrs. Stevenson, or return the unearned 
fee, 
despite Mrs. Stevenson’s repeated requests.</p>
<h3>Count VII</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">On February 18, 1998, respondent was arrested for possession of crack 
cocaine. On July 1, 1998, he entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charge and

of 
active probation. <span class="CITE">State of Louisiana v. Kimball, 396, 223 “H,” Criminal District 
Court for the Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana</span></p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<h3>Motion for Interim Suspension</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Shortly after his conviction, respondent and the ODC filed a joint petition 
for 
immediate interim suspension. This court granted the request and placed 
respondent 
on interim suspension. <span class="CITE">In re: Kimball, 98-1372 (La. 6/17/98), 712 So. 2d 498</span>.</p>
<h3>Formal Charges</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After investigation, the ODC filed seven counts of formal charges alleging 
respondent’s actions violated the following provisions of the Rules of 
Professional 
Conduct: Rules <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.4 --#">1.4</a></span> (failure to communicate),
<span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.5 --#">1.5</a>(a)(6)</span> (failure to refund 
unearned 
fees), <span class="Rules"><a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(b)</span> (commission of a criminal act adversely reflecting on a lawyer’s 
honesty, 
trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer), <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(c)</span> (engaging in conduct involving 
deceit, 
dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation) and <span class="Rules">
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE8.4 --#">8.4</a>(g)</span> (failure to cooperate with 
the ODC) 
of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent failed to file an answer to the charges and, as a result, they 
were 
deemed admitted pursuant to <span class="AllRules">Rule XIX, § 11(E)(3)</span>. Accordingly, no formal hearing 
was conducted. The matter was submitted to the hearing committee on documentary 
evidence presented by the ODC.<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> Respondent submitted no documentary evidence 
or memorandum in support of his case.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-122.HC --#">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Because the charges were deemed admitted, the hearing committee focused on 
the appropriate sanction for respondent’s misconduct. Citing the ABA’s <i>Standards 
for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions</i>,<a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a> the committee concluded the baseline sanction for&nbsp; 
respondent’s criminal conviction was a suspension, and the baseline sanction for 
his 
other misconduct was disbarment. As aggravating factors, the committee 
recognized 
a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, failure to comply with orders of a 
disciplinary agency and indifference to making restitution. The committee 
identified 
no mitigating factors. Accordingly, the committee recommended imposition of 
disbarment.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:99-DB-122.BD --#">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent did not file a brief for the board’s consideration, nor did he 
appear 
for the board panel argument. In its recommendation, the board observed that, 
although respondent was given proper notice of the proceedings by certified mail 
at 
his primary registration address, he may not have received the notice, as it was 
returned unclaimed. Nonetheless, it pointed out respondent had actual knowledge 
of 
the disciplinary proceedings based upon his participation in the joint petition 
for 
immediate interim suspension.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">On the merits, the board adopted the findings of the hearing committee in all 
respects. Specifically, it concluded respondent violated duties owed to his 
clients and 
the public, and that his conduct was knowing, if not intentional, when he 
accepted 
cases, failed to perform the work and then refused to return his clients’ money, 
despite 
their requests. The board relied on the ABA Standards and aggravating factors 
cited 
by the board. It also noted in aggravation the vulnerability of respondent’s 
victims, 
his substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted in 1980), his 
indifference to 
making restitution and his illegal conduct involving the use of controlled 
dangerous 
substances. The board also pointed out that no mitigating factors were 
recognized. 
Relying on the case of <span class="CITE"><i>In re: Banks</i>, 99-0609 (La. 5/7/99), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:734%20So.2d%20613 --#">734 So. 2d 613</a></span>,<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a> the 
board&nbsp; 
recommended that respondent be disbarred from the practice of law. 
Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection in this court to the 
recommendation of the disciplinary board.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record supports the findings of the hearing committee that the charges 
against respondent have been proven. Therefore, the sole issue presented for our 
consideration is the appropriate sanction for respondent’s misconduct.&nbsp; In 
determining a sanction, we are mindful that disciplinary proceedings are 
designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the public, preserve the 
integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n 
v. Reis</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:513%20So.2d%201173 --#">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed depends upon 
the 
facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, considered in 
light of 
any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="CITE"><i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. 
Whittington</i>, <a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record reveals that respondent totally abandoned the cases of six 
clients. 
After taking legal fees from these clients, respondent made no effort whatsoever 
to 
pursue their cases, nor did he refund his unearned legal fees. In addition to 
his 
misconduct involving clients, respondent was also convicted of a felony drug 
offense, 
which clearly reflects on his moral fitness to practice law.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Numerous aggravating factors are present, including the vulnerability of 
respondent’s victims, his substantial experience in the practice of law 
(admitted in 
1980) and his indifference to making restitution. We are unable to discern any 
mitigating factors from the record.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">We find no basis to deviate from the baseline sanction of disbarment. 
Accordingly, we will accept the board’s recommendation and disbar respondent 
from 
the practice of law.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee and 
disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that the name of 
Spencer 
W. Kimball, II be stricken from the roll of attorneys and that his license to 
practice law 
in the State of Louisiana be revoked. All costs and expenses in the matter are 
assessed against respondent in accordance with <span class="AllRules">Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1</span>, 
with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this 
court’s 
judgment until paid.</p>
<hr>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1">1</a> Through a clerical error, respondent was erroneously referred to as “Spencer 
W. Kimball, III” in the&nbsp; 
proceedings in the hearing committee and disciplinary board. In fact, 
respondent’s correct name, as listed 
on the bar rolls of this court as well as earlier pleadings filed in the court 
in connection with respondent’s 
interim suspension, is “Spencer W. Kimball, II.”</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2">2</a> Particularly, the ODC submitted the affidavit of its investigator, H. Patton 
Stewart, attesting to the&nbsp; 
extensive measures taken on his part to locate respondent. His investigation 
concluded that respondent 
was last known to be employed in a non-legal capacity in the State of Texas.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn3">3</a> Standard 4.61 provides “[d]isbarment is generally appropriate when a lawyer 
knowingly deceives a&nbsp; 
client with the intent to benefit the lawyer or another, and causes serious or 
potentially serious injury to a 
client.” Standard 5.12 provides “[s]uspension is generally appropriate when a 
lawyer knowingly engages 
in criminal conduct which does not contain the elements listed in Standard 5.11 
and that seriously adversely 
reflects on the lawyer’s fitness to practice.”</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn4">4</a> In Banks, this court disbarred an attorney who had been held in contempt of 
court for his failure to&nbsp; 
attend hearings, use of an invalid credit card, improperly issuing checks from 
his client trust account and 
failing to cooperate in the ODC’s investigation of three complaints and 
resulting disciplinary proceeding. 
As in the instant case, numerous aggravating factors and no mitigating factors 
were present in Banks.</p>
