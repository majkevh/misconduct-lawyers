<p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="headingstyle">NO. 07-B-1813</p>
<p class="headingstyle">IN RE: EARL T. LINDSAY, JR.</p>
<p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by 
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) against respondent, Earl T. Lindsay, Jr., a 
disbarred
attorney.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent was disbarred by this court on December 11, 1989.<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> Louisiana
State Bar Ass'n v. Lindsay, 553 So. 2d 807 (La. 1989). He has not applied for
readmission to the bar since that time.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Between April 1991 and May 2005, respondent appeared as defense counsel
in forty-five traffic cases pending in the First and Second Parish Courts in 
Jefferson
Parish, Louisiana. Based on its investigation of these matters, the ODC filed 
formal
charges against respondent, alleging that his conduct violated the following
provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules 5.5(a) (engaging in the
unauthorized practice of law), 8.4(b) (commission of a criminal act reflecting
adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer),<a name="fnref2" class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a> 
8.4(c)
(engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 
and
8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent answered the formal charges, admitting to the allegations and
requesting a hearing in mitigation. Despite adequate notice, respondent failed 
to
appear at the hearing.</p>
<h3><span class="cite"><a href="../HC/2007-04-12_06-DB-027.htm">Hearing Committee Report</a></span></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After considering the evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, the
hearing committee found the ODC presented clear and convincing evidence that
respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal
charges. For his intentional misconduct, the committee recommended that 
respondent
be permanently disbarred.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee's
recommendation.</p>
<h3><span class="cite"><a href="../DB/2007-09-07_06-DB-027.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a></span></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">After review of the record, the disciplinary board found no manifest error in 
the
hearing committee's findings, and agreed that respondent violated the Rules of
Professional Conduct as set forth in the formal charges. The board found that
respondent intentionally engaged in the practice of law in violation of duties 
owed
to the public, the legal system, and the legal profession. The evidence shows 
that
numerous clients, courts, and attorneys were deceived by respondent stemming 
from
his unauthorized representation of clients over a period of fourteen years.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The board found the following aggravating factors present: prior disciplinary
offenses, dishonest or selfish motive, a pattern of misconduct, multiple 
offenses,
vulnerability of the victims, substantial experience in the practice of law 
(admitted
1978), and illegal conduct. No mitigating factors were found by the board.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Based on these findings and this court's prior jurisprudence, the board 
adopted
the committee's recommended sanction of permanent disbarment, and further
recommended that respondent be assessed with all costs of these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board's
recommendation.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Bar disciplinary matters fall within the original jurisdiction of this court. 
La.
Const. art. V, § 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an
independent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has
been proven by clear and convincing evidence. In re: Quaid, 94-1316 (La. 
11/30/94),
646 So. 2d 343, 348; Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Boutall, 597 So. 2d 444 (La. 
1992).
While we are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of the
hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error 
standard
is applicable to the committee's factual findings. See In re: Caulfield, 96-1401 
(La.
11/25/96), 683 So. 2d 714; In re: Pardue, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94), 633 So. 2d 150.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record in this matter supports the factual findings of the hearing 
committee
and the disciplinary board. Clearly, respondent violated the Rules of 
Professional
Conduct by knowingly and intentionally practicing law after his disbarment.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Having found professional misconduct, we now turn to a discussion of an
appropriate sanction. In considering that issue, we are mindful that 
disciplinary
proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the 
public,
preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. Louisiana 
State
Bar Ass'n v. Reis, 513 So. 2d 1173 (La. 1987). The discipline to be imposed 
depends
upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, 
considered
in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Louisiana State Bar 
Ass'n
v. Whittington, 459 So. 2d 520 (La. 1984).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">It is well settled that the unauthorized practice of law by a suspended or
disbarred attorney is very serious misconduct. In re: Jackson, 02-3062 (La. 
4/9/03),
843 So. 2d 1079. In general, when the attorney has manifested a conscious intent 
to
flout the authority of this court by practicing after being prohibited from 
doing so, we
have not hesitated to impose disbarment. See, e.g., In re: Jones, 99-1036 (La.
10/19/99), 747 So. 2d 1081 (attorney disbarred for engaging in the unauthorized
practice of law on four occasions, after being suspended in the past for similar
misconduct).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In the instant case, the sheer number of instances of unauthorized practice 
of
law over a lengthy period of time illustrates that respondent has made a 
conscious
decision to practice law despite the revocation of his license by this court. 
Numerous
aggravating factors are present, including prior disciplinary offenses, 
dishonest or
selfish motive, a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, vulnerability of the
victims, substantial experience in the practice of law, and illegal conduct. We 
are
unable to discern any mitigating factors from the record. Unquestionably, 
therefore,
respondent's misconduct warrants disbarment.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The sole remaining issue presented for our consideration is whether
respondent's conduct is so egregious that this disbarment should be made 
permanent.
In Appendix E to Supreme Court Rule XIX, we set forth guidelines illustrating 
the
types of conduct which might result in permanent disbarment. While these 
guidelines
are not intended to bind this court in its decision-making process, they present 
useful
information concerning the types of conduct we might consider worthy of 
permanent
disbarment. See In re: Yaeger, 05-0035 (La. 3/18/05), 897 So. 2d 571.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">For purposes of the instant case, Guidelines 8 and 9 are relevant. Those
guidelines detail the following conduct:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>GUIDELINE 8. Following notice, engaging in the
unauthorized practice of law subsequent to resigning from
the Bar Association, or during the period of time in which
the lawyer is suspended from the practice of law or
disbarred.</p>
	<p>GUIDELINE 9. Instances of serious attorney misconduct
or conviction of a serious crime, when the misconduct or
conviction is preceded by suspension or disbarment for
prior instances of serious attorney misconduct or
conviction of a serious crime. Serious crime is defined in
Rule XIX, Section 19. Serious attorney misconduct is
defined for purposes of these guidelines as any misconduct
which results in a suspension of more than one year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Bodycopy">Guideline 8 is clearly implicated by respondent's failure to cease the 
practice
of law after he was disbarred in 1989. Likewise, Guideline 9 is applicable, as
respondent's unauthorized practice of law is serious attorney misconduct which 
was
preceded by his disbarment for prior instances of serious attorney misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Considering these guidelines together with the indisputable evidence of
respondent's fundamental lack of moral character and fitness, we can conceive of 
no
circumstance under which we would ever grant readmission to respondent. See In 
re:
Jefferson, 04-0239 (La. 6/18/04), 878 So. 2d 503. Accordingly, we will accept 
the
disciplinary board's recommendation and permanently disbar respondent.</p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee
and the disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that the 
name of
Earl Thomas Lindsay, Jr., Louisiana Bar Roll number 8579, be stricken from the 
roll
of attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be 
revoked.
Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 24(A), it is further ordered that 
respondent
be permanently prohibited from being readmitted to the practice of law in this 
state.
All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in 
accordance
with Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days
from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
<hr>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1">1</a> The charges for which 
respondent was disciplined involved numerous instances of serious
misconduct, including commingling and conversion of client funds.</p>
<p class="footnotetext"><a name="fn2" class="fn" href="#fnref2">2</a> La. R.S. 37:213 makes it a 
crime to engage in the unauthorized practice of law.</p>
