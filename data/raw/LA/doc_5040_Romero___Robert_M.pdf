  <p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>

  <p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">The Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") commenced an investigation into allegations that respondent neglected his client's legal matter, failed to communicate with his client, and failed to timely refund costs paid in advance. This misconduct occurred in the same time frame as the misconduct forming the basis of respondent's earlier disciplinary matter. Prior to the filing of new formal charges, respondent and the ODC submitted a joint petition for consent discipline. Having reviewed the petition,</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Consent Discipline be accepted and that Robert Mark Romero, Louisiana Bar Roll number 11440, be adjudged guilty of additional violations which warrant discipline and which may be considered in the event he applies for reinstatement from his suspension in <span class="cite">In re: Romero, 04-3087 (La. 4/29/05), <a href="2005-04-29_2004-3087.htm">900 So. 2d 819</a></span>, after becoming eligible to do so. See <span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass'n v. Chatelain, <a href="1991-01-22_1989-0703.htm">573 So. 2d 470</a> (La. 1991)</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bodycopy">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, ยง 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court's judgment until paid.</p>
