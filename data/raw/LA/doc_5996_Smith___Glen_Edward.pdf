<p class="headingstyle">SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>
<p class="headingstyle">NO. 06-B-1709</p>
<p class="headingstyle">IN RE: GLEN EDWARD SMITH</p>
<p class="headingstyle">ATTORNEY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="signature">PER CURIAM</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by the Office of
Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) against respondent, Glen Edward Smith, a disbarred
attorney. For the reasons that follow, we now permanently disbar respondent.</p>
<h2>PRIOR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Before we address the current charges, we find it helpful to review
respondent&#39;s prior disciplinary history. Respondent was admitted to the practice 
of
law in Louisiana in 1992. On June 30, 1999, we granted a joint petition for 
interim
suspension which had been filed by the parties on June 1, 1999. 
<span class="cite">In re: Smith, 
99-1575 (La. 6/30/99), 738 So. 2d 1053</span>. Six months later, we accepted a petition 
for
consent discipline and disbarred respondent, retroactive to the date of his 
interim
suspension. <span class="cite">In re: Smith, 99-3307 (La. 12/17/99), 752 So. 2d 798</span> (hereinafter
referred to as &quot;Smith I&quot;). The misconduct at issue in Smith I was extremely 
serious
and included, among other things, respondent&#39;s conversion of client and 
third-party
funds, neglect of legal matters, failure to communicate with clients, failure to 
refund
unearned fees, and failure to cooperate with the ODC in its investigation.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Against this backdrop, we now turn to a consideration of the misconduct at
issue in the present proceeding.</p>
<h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>
<h3>The Thompson Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In March 1998, while representing Cecil and Sandra Thompson in a personal
injury matter, respondent guaranteed payment of the Thompsons&#39; debt to Azimuth
Financial Corporation (&quot;Azimuth&quot;) out of any judgment or settlement obtained by 
the
Thompsons. In September 1998, the Thompsons&#39; personal injury matter settled.
Thereafter, respondent withheld $2,085 from the settlement to pay Azimuth.
However, he failed to remit the payment to Azimuth and, instead, converted the 
funds
to his own use. In June 1999, counsel for Azimuth filed a complaint against
respondent with the ODC.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent&#39;s conduct violated Rules 1.15(b)
(safekeeping property of clients or third parties) and 8.4(c) (engaging in 
conduct
involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) of the Rules of 
Professional
Conduct.</p>
<h3>The Delvalle Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">On June 2, 1999, the day after respondent and the ODC filed a joint petition for
interim suspension in this court, respondent accepted the representation of 
Angela
Delvalle in a custody matter. Ms. Delvalle paid respondent a $3,000 retainer 
fee.
Respondent accepted the representation knowing he was to be interimly suspended.
He also failed to communicate with his client and neglected her legal matter 
when he
failed to appear for a scheduled hearing on June 15, 1999. On June 30, 1999, Ms.
Delvalle terminated respondent&#39;s representation. Thereafter, respondent refunded
$2,000 to Ms. Delvalle but failed to account for the balance of the fee he 
retained.
In July 1999, Ms. Delvalle filed a complaint against respondent with the ODC.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent&#39;s conduct violated Rules 1.3 (failure to act
with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), 1.4<a name="fnref1" class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a> 
(failure to
communicate with a client), 1.15, and 8.4(c) of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct.</p>
<h3>The Irula Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">On June 14, 1999, nearly two weeks after respondent and the ODC filed a joint
petition for interim suspension in this court, respondent accepted the 
representation
of Vladimir Irula in a DWI matter. Mr. Irula paid respondent $250 towards a $550
fee. Respondent accepted the representation knowing he was to be interimly
suspended. He also neglected Mr. Irula&#39;s legal matter and failed to appear in 
court
on the arraignment date, which resulted in the issuance of a bench warrant for 
Mr.
Irula&#39;s arrest. Furthermore, respondent failed to communicate with Mr. Irula and
failed to refund the unearned fee. In July 1999, Mr. Irula filed a complaint 
against
respondent with the ODC.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent&#39;s conduct violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 (failure
to refund an unearned fee), and 8.4(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<h3>The Morrison Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In 1997, Bertha Morrison hired respondent to handle two separate personal
injury matters. Respondent neglected the matters and failed to communicate with 
Ms.
Morrison. Upon respondent&#39;s subsequent interim suspension and disbarment, he
failed to return Ms. Morrison&#39;s file to her. In August 1999, Ms. Morrison filed 
a
complaint against respondent with the ODC.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent&#39;s conduct violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 1.16(d)
(obligations upon termination of the representation) of the Rules of 
Professional
Conduct. The ODC also alleged that respondent violated Supreme Court Rule XIX,
ยง 26 (notice to clients, adverse parties, and other counsel) by failing to 
return Ms.
Morrison&#39;s file after his interim suspension.</p>
<h3>The Spencer Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">In January 1999, James Paul Spencer hired respondent to represent him in a
DWI matter, paying him $500. Respondent appeared in court for Mr. Spencer&#39;s
arraignment but performed no other work in the matter; nevertheless, he failed 
to
refund the unearned portion of the fee Mr. Spencer paid. Respondent also 
accepted
$2,000 to represent Mr. Spencer in a divorce proceeding. In this matter, 
respondent
made only a single one-hour court appearance. Thereafter, he performed no other
work in the matter and failed to refund the unearned portion of the fee. 
Respondent
also failed to communicate with his client. In August 1999, Mr. Spencer filed a
complaint against respondent with the ODC.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The ODC alleged that respondent&#39;s conduct violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 of
the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<h3>The Husser Matter</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent represented Joseph and Morningstar Husser in February 1998
when Woman&#39;s Hospital obtained a judgment against Mr. Husser. Thereafter, Mr.
Husser instructed respondent to make arrangements with the hospital to permit 
him
to pay the judgment in installments. Respondent claimed to have done so and
informed his clients the hospital would accept the sum of $8,800 in installment
payments. The Hussers then sent several payments totaling $8,800 to respondent,
who was to forward said payments to the hospital. Although respondent assured 
the
Hussers that the matter had been &quot;taken care of,&quot; when they later tried to sell 
their
house, they learned the hospital still had a viable judgment against them 
because it
never received any payments. Furthermore, the hospital advised the Hussers that 
it
had never negotiated a resolution of the judgment with respondent.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">During the same period of time, the Hussers learned they owed sales taxes to
the Louisiana Department of Revenue related to the operation of their business.
Again, the Hussers requested respondent&#39;s help. He claimed to have arranged
payment of the taxes to the Department of Revenue on an installment basis. The
Hussers then sent several payments totaling $9,500 to respondent, who was to
forward said payments to the Department of Revenue. Subsequently, the Department
of Revenue seized the Hussers&#39; bank accounts to satisfy the past due taxes.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Thereafter, the Hussers learned respondent had never forwarded their funds to 
the
Department of Revenue.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In October 1999, counsel for Mr. and Mrs. Husser filed a complaint against
respondent with the ODC. Following investigation of the complaint, the ODC
determined that respondent&#39;s conduct violated Rules 8.4(b) (commission of a 
criminal
act reflecting adversely on the lawyer&#39;s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as 
a
lawyer) and 8.4(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<h3>The Failure to Cooperate Matter</h3>
<p>In each of the above matters, respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC in<br>
its investigation by either failing to claim the certified mail notifying him of 
the<br>
complaint or by failing to respond after claiming the certified mail. The ODC 
alleged<br>
6<br>
that respondent&#39;s conduct violated Rules 8.1(c) (failure to cooperate with the ODC<br>
in its investigation) and 8.4(g) (failure to cooperate with the ODC in its 
investigation)<br>
of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<br>
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS<br>
Respondent failed to answer or otherwise reply to the formal charges filed<br>
against him on February 19, 2004. Accordingly, by order of the hearing committee<br>
chair dated August 31, 2004, the factual allegations contained therein were 
deemed<br>
admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Supreme Court<br>
Rule XIX, ยง 11(E)(3). No formal hearing was held, but the parties were given an<br>
opportunity to file with the hearing committee written arguments and documentary<br>
evidence on the issue of sanctions. In its submission filed on August 15, 2005, 
the<br>
ODC recommended the imposition of permanent disbarment for respondent&#39;s<br>
intentional and &quot;serious misconduct after his agreed-upon suspension from the<br>
practice of law.&quot; Respondent filed nothing for the hearing committee&#39;s 
consideration.</p>
<p><a href="../HC/2005-11-28_04-DB-012.htm">Hearing Committee Recommendation</a></p>
<p>The hearing committee determined that the factual allegations of the formal<br>
charges were deemed admitted and proven by clear and convincing evidence 
pursuant<br>
to Supreme Court Rule XIX, ยง 11(E)(3). The committee also determined that<br>
respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal<br>
charges.<br>
Based on these findings, the committee determined that respondent violated<br>
duties owed to his clients, the public, the legal system, and as a professional. 
He<br>
acted intentionally, causing actual harm. Relying on the ABA&#39;s Standards for<br>
7<br>
Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, the committee found that the baseline sanction is<br>
disbarment.<br>
As aggravating factors, the committee found the following to be present: a<br>
dishonest or selfish motive, a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, bad 
faith<br>
obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply 
with the<br>
rules or orders of the disciplinary agency, vulnerability of the victims, and 
substantial<br>
experience in the practice of law (admitted 1992). The committee found no<br>
mitigating factors to be present.<br>
Further relying on Guidelines 1 (repeated or multiple instances of intentional<br>
conversion of client funds with substantial harm) and 8 (following notice, 
engaging<br>
in the unauthorized practice of law subsequent to resigning from the Bar 
Association,<br>
or while the lawyer is suspended from the practice of law or disbarred) of the<br>
permanent disbarment guidelines, the committee recommended that respondent be<br>
permanently disbarred.<br>
Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee&#39;s<br>
recommendation.<br>
<a href="../DB/2006-07-06_04-DB-012.htm">Disciplinary Board Recommendation</a><br>
After review, the disciplinary board determined that the hearing committee&#39;s<br>
factual findings are supported by the record and that the committee properly 
applied<br>
the Rules of Professional Conduct. The board accepted the aggravating factors 
found<br>
by the committee but added the aggravating factor of prior disciplinary 
offenses.<br>
The board agreed with the committee that permanent disbarment is appropriate<br>
in this matter, citing Guidelines 1 and 8 of the permanent disbarment 
guidelines.<br>
Respondent&#39;s conversion of funds in the Thompson and Husser matters, as well as 
his<br>
8<br>
failure to account for or refund unearned fees in the Delvalle, Irula, and 
Spencer<br>
matters, makes Guideline 1 applicable. The board also asserted that respondent&#39;s<br>
acceptance of the representations of Ms. Delvalle and Mr. Irula after he had 
filed a<br>
joint petition with the ODC requesting his interim suspension makes Guideline 8<br>
applicable. The board reasoned that &quot;[e]ven though respondent had not 
technically<br>
&#39;received notice&#39; of his interim suspension at the time he accepted the 
representation<br>
of these two individuals, his actions certainly fall within the realm of the 
guideline.<br>
He knew or should have known that his suspension was imminent and he could not<br>
complete the representation of these individuals.&quot;<br>
Based on this reasoning, the board recommended that respondent be<br>
permanently disbarred.</p>
<p>Neither respondent nor the ODC filed an objection to the disciplinary board&#39;s<br>
recommendation.</p>
<p>DISCUSSION</p>
<p>Bar disciplinary matters come within the original jurisdiction of this court. 
La.<br>
Const. art. V, ยง 5(B). Consequently, we act as triers of fact and conduct an<br>
independent review of the record to determine whether the alleged misconduct has<br>
been proven by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="cite">In re: Quaid, 
94-1316 (La. 11/30/94), <a href="1994-11-30_1994-1316.htm">646 So. 2d 343</a></span>;
<span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass&#39;n v. Boutall,
<a href="1992-04-20_1991-2692.htm">597 So. 2d 444</a> (La. 1992)</span>. While we are not bound in any way by the findings and recommendations of<br>
the hearing committee and disciplinary board, we have held the manifest error<br>
standard is applicable to the committee&#39;s factual findings. See 
<span class="cite">In re: Caulfield, 96-1401 (La. 11/25/96),
<a href="1996-11-25_1996-1401.htm">683 So. 2d 714</a></span>; <span class="cite">
In re: Pardue, 93-2865 (La. 3/11/94), <a href="1994-03-11_1993-2865.htm">633 So. 
2d 150</a></span>.</p>
<p>The record of this deemed admitted proceeding reveals that respondent<br>
neglected legal matters, failed to communicate with his clients, converted to 
his own<br>
use client and third-party funds, failed to account for or refund unearned fees 
paid by<br>
his clients, failed to return a client&#39;s file, and failed to cooperate with the ODC in its<br>
investigation. This conduct clearly falls below the standards expected of a 
lawyer<br>
licensed to practice law in this state and, most disappointingly, is markedly 
similar<br>
to that which we saw in Smith I.</p>
<p>Having found professional misconduct, we now turn to a discussion of an<br>
appropriate sanction. In considering that issue, we are mindful that 
disciplinary<br>
proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of conduct, protect the 
public,<br>
preserve the integrity of the profession, and deter future misconduct. 
<span class="cite">Louisiana State Bar Ass&#39;n v. Reis,
<a href="1987-10-19_1986-1788.htm">513 So. 2d 1173</a> (La. 1987)</span>. The discipline to be imposed 
depends<br>
upon the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved, 
considered<br>
in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <span class="cite">
Louisiana State Bar Ass&#39;n v. Whittington, <a href="1984-11-26_1983-2479.htm">459 
So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>
<p>Respondent knowingly and intentionally violated duties owed to his clients, the<br>
public, the legal system, and as a professional, causing actual harm. The 
baseline<br>
sanction for respondent&#39;s misconduct is undoubtedly disbarment according to the<br>
ABA&#39;s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions and our prior decisions. The only<br>
mitigating factor which is apparent from the record is the undue delay which has<br>
marked this disciplinary proceeding;2 however, considering the numerous 
aggravating<br>
factors present, this solitary mitigating circumstance is insufficient to 
warrant a<br>
downward deviation from the baseline sanction of disbarment.</p>
<p><br>
10<br>
The sole remaining issue presented for our consideration is whether<br>
respondent&#39;s misconduct is so egregious that he should be permanently prohibited<br>
from reapplying for admission to the practice of law. In Appendix E to Supreme<br>
Court Rule XIX, we set forth guidelines illustrating the types of conduct which 
might<br>
warrant permanent disbarment. While these guidelines are not intended to bind 
this<br>
court in its decision-making process, they present useful information concerning 
the<br>
types of conduct we might consider worthy of permanent disbarment.<br>
Applying the guidelines to the instant case, we find respondent&#39;s conversion<br>
of funds due to his clients and/or their creditors falls within the scope of 
Guideline<br>
1, which indicates that permanent disbarment is appropriate in cases of repeated 
or<br>
multiple instances of intentional conversion of client funds with substantial 
harm.<br>
Likewise, respondent&#39;s failure to account for and refund unearned fees paid by 
his<br>
clients resulted in a conversion of those funds to the detriment of his clients.<br>
Respondent&#39;s conduct caused substantial harm to his clients, particularly to Mr. 
and<br>
Mrs. Husser. As previously discussed, the Hussers&#39; bank accounts were seized and<br>
a lien was placed on their home by their creditors after respondent converted 
$18,300<br>
which they had delivered to him to pay the debts in question. Respondent&#39;s 
actions<br>
clearly justify permanent disbarment pursuant to Guideline 1.3</p>
<p>Considering respondent&#39;s misconduct in this case in light of his earlier<br>
professional violations in Smith I, we reach the inescapable conclusion that<br>
respondent is not morally fit to practice law in the State of Louisiana. He has<br>
victimized both clients and third parties in the past and it is highly likely he 
will<br>
continue to do so in the future if given an opportunity. In order to protect the 
public<br>
and maintain the high standards of the legal profession in this state, we must<br>
permanently disbar respondent.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we will accept the recommendation of the disciplinary board and<br>
disbar respondent on a permanent basis. We will also order respondent to make<br>
restitution to his victims.</p>
<p>DECREE</p>
<p>Upon review of the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee<br>
and disciplinary board, and considering the record, it is ordered that the name 
of Glen<br>
Edward Smith, Louisiana Bar Roll number 21884, be stricken from the roll of<br>
attorneys and that his license to practice law in the State of Louisiana be 
revoked.<br>
Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule XIX, ยง 24(A), it is further ordered that 
respondent<br>
be permanently prohibited from being readmitted to the practice of law in this 
state.<br>
Respondent is ordered to make restitution to his victims. All costs and expenses 
in<br>
the matter are assessed against respondent in accordance with Supreme Court Rule<br>
XIX, ยง 10.1, with legal interest to commence thirty days from the date of 
finality of<br>
this court&#39;s judgment until paid.</p>

<hr>
<p><a name="fn1" class="fn" href="#fnref1">1</a> The ODC actually charged respondent with a Rule 1.14 violation. However, 
considering<br>
the nature of the misconduct, this appears to be a typographical error.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the misconduct at issue in this proceeding occurred before respondent 
was disbarred<br>
in Smith I. Indeed, all of the complaints against respondent were filed with the 
ODC prior to our<br>
December 17, 1999 decision in that case. Nevertheless, the ODC did not seek to 
consolidate the two
proceedings. Moreover, for reasons which have not been adequately explained in 
this record, the
ODC did not institute formal charges in this matter until February 2004.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3" class="fn" href="#fnref3">3</a> Because we find Guideline 1 applies to this case, we need not decide the 
correctness of the<br>
board&#39;s reasoning concerning the applicability of Guideline 8. However, we 
observe in passing that<br>
Guideline 8 applies to lawyers who engage in the unauthorized practice of law 
following resignation,<br>
suspension, or disbarment. In the instant case, respondent was not suspended at 
the time he accepted<br>
the representations in the Dalvalle and Irula matters, and there is no evidence 
in this record that he<br>
practiced law for these clients after his interim suspension became effective. 
Although it is<br>
obviously ill advised for an attorney to accept new client representations 
during the period between<br>
submission of a petition for interim suspension and action on the petition by 
this court, it does not<br>
appear such conduct, standing alone, constitutes the unauthorized practice of 
law for purposes of<br>
Guideline 8.</p>
