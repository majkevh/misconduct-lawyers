  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">NUMBER 99-DB-074</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">IN RE CAROL J. AYMOND</p>

  <p class="HEADINGSTYLE">RULING</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">This is a disciplinary proceeding based upon the filing of a Petition for Consent Discipline by
  the Respondent Carol Aymond, after the filing of formal charges.</p>

  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On August 6, 1999, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC") filed formal charges consisting of
  one count against the Respondent Carol J. Aymond alleging violations of rules <span class="allegedrules">1.15</span>,
  <span class="allegedrules">8.4(d)</span> and <span class="allegedrules">1.16(d)</span> of the Rules of Professional
  Conduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On August 27, 1999, the Respondent filed an answer denying the allegations asserted in the formal
  charges.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On September 1, 1999, the ODC filed a motion for discovery pursuant to Rule XIX § 1 5A and § 1 8E
  requesting the Respondent provided the ODC with the names and addresses of all persons known to him who would have
  knowledge or relevant facts regarding the instant matter, as well as a list of all persons the Respondent intended to
  call as a witness at the hearing on this matter.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On September 3, 1999, the chairman of Hearing Committee number 5, Mr. Charles Harper granted the
  motion of the ODC.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On September 15, 1999, the Respondent filed a motion for discovery upon the ODC for information
  regarding the persons they intended to call at the hearing on this matter. The Hearing Committee chair granted the
  Respondent's motion on September 20, 1999.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On September 29, 1999, the Respondent filed a petition for consent discipline, tendering his
  admission to the misconduct as alleged in the formal charges. The Respondent is proposing a public reprimand as the
  disciplinary sanction.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">On September 29, 1999, the ODC filed its concurrence to the petition for consent discipline.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">A Panel of the Disciplinary Board reviewed this matter on November 18, 1999. Deputy Counsel
  Robert S. Kennedy represented the ODC. The Respondent was not present at the proceedings.</p>

  <h2>FORMAL CHARGES</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">The formal charges', consisting of one count alleges that the Respondent was retained by a Ms.
  Donna Dupuy. On December 2, 1996 Ms. Dupuy discharged the Respondent as her attorney. She requested the return of her
  case file through her new attorney, Mr. Brian Cauberreaux. The Respondent refused to return the file, and refused to
  withdraw his name as counsel of record after being discharged. It is alleged that the actions of the Respondent
  violated rules <span class="Rules">1.15</span>, <span class="Rules">1.16(d)</span> and
  <span class="Rules">8.4(d)</span> of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

  <h2>REQUEST FOR CONSENT DISCIPLINE</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">On September 29, 1999, the Respondent filed a petition for consent discipline, admitting to the
  misconduct, and proposing a sanction of a public reprimand. The ODC filed its concurrence in this matter indicating
  that they are in agreement with the proposed sanction.</p>

  <h2>APPLICATION OF FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IMPOSING SANCTIONS</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX § 10(C) states that in imposing a sanction after a finding of
  lawyer misconduct, the court or board shall consider the following factors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="inverted">(1) whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal
    system, or to the profession;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(2) whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;</p>

    <p class="inverted">(3) the amount of actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and</p>

    <p class="inverted">(4) the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="bodycopy">The conduct that the Respondent has admitted to engaging in is a violation to the duty the
  attorney has to his client and the legal system. The conduct was dilatory and prejudicial to the administration of
  justice. Additionally, the Respondent acted intentionally and knowingly when he refused the request of his former
  client and her new attorney to turn over a case file, in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. However in
  view of the aggravating and mitigating factor involved, we find that the proposed sanction is appropriate to address
  the misconduct of the Respondent. Mr. Aymond has <span class="ABAstandard">no prior disciplinary record</span>, and
  there does not appear to be any aggravating factors associated with the misconduct.</p>

  <p class="bodycopy">Pursuant to the ABA Standards For Imposing Lawyer Sanctions Standard
  <span class="ABAstandard">4.13</span> suggest, "reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent in
  dealing with client property and causes injury or potential injury." There was no injury to the client in this matter
  except for the inconvenience to her new attorney who had to reconstruct the case file. The jurisprudence reviewed
  involving this type of misconduct also included other rule violations such as neglect of legal matters and failure to
  communicate with the client. See <span class="CITE">In Re: Dennis Dolbear
  <a href="1999-02-24_98-DB-061.htm">98-DB-061</a> (2/24/99)</span> (public reprimand for failure to return an unearned
  fee, failure to return case file to client, and failure to cooperate with the ODC). The Respondent's conduct was
  slightly less serious than Mr. Dolbear in the aforementioned case.</p>

  <h2>RULING</h2>

  <p class="bodycopy">Considering the foregoing, the petition for consent discipline proposing a public reprimand is
  hereby accepted. As such, it is ORDERED that a public reprimand be issued against the Respondent for violation of the
  Rules of Professional Conduct. It is further ORDERED that the Respondent be assessed with the costs and expenses of
  these proceeding, with legal interest commencing thirty days from the date of finality of this Ruling.</p>
