<span class="Sanction">Suspension</span>
<span class="Misconduct">Failure to Supervise Office Personnel</span>
<p class="Bodycopy">This disciplinary
proceeding arises from one count of formal charges filed by the Office of
Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) against respondent, Neal W. Wilkinson, an attorney
licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana. </p>
<h2>UNDERLYING FACTS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">In August, 1996,
Kimberly Saucier Emanuel approached respondent about handling the succession of
her father, who had passed away, leaving Mrs. Emanuel as executrix of his
estate. Respondent advised Mrs. Emanuel that he could not take the case because
he was involved in an election campaign. However, he introduced Mrs. Emanuel to
Paul Doug Stewart, a Mississippi law school graduate who was working as a law
clerk in respondent’s office and had taken the Louisiana bar examination in
July, 1996. Respondent advised Mrs. Emanuel that Mr. Stewart could handle the
necessary preliminary matters in the case under respondent’s supervision, and
then fully assume the representation once he was admitted to the bar. Based on
respondent’s assertions, Mrs. Emanuel agreed to the arrangement, and gave
respondent $650, which he agreed to hold in trust for Mr. Stewart’s anticipated
expenses. According to respondent, he cautioned Mr. Stewart not to give any
legal advice to Mrs. Emanuel.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Days following the
meeting, Mr. Stewart drafted a letter to Mrs. Emanuel, under both his name and
respondent’s name, confirming that respondent’s law firm would be handling the
succession matter. The letter promised to keep Mrs. Emanuel informed on a
variety of issues on which she might need “further legal advice.” Respondent was
generally made aware of the contents of the letter by telephone, and directed
his secretary to send it out under his signature. Mr. Stewart also signed the
letter.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The following day,
respondent sent a letter to the will’s notary and witnesses asking them to
execute affidavits to permit the probate of the will. After sending these
letters, respondent had no further involvement in the succession. He never spoke
with Mrs. Emanuel again, nor did he ever review her file. Although he discussed
the fee arrangement with Mr. Stewart, respondent never specifically inquired
about the details of Mr. Stewart’s handling of the succession proceeding.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In early
September, 1996, still prior to Mr. Stewart’s bar admission, the heirs began
receiving notices from one of the mortgage creditors. While Mr. Stewart
attempted to resolve the matter with the mortgage company, he was unable to
successfully handle the problem. Mr. Stewart never advised respondent of the
problems with the mortgage company.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In October, 1996, Mr. Stewart was admitted to the practice of law in Louisiana.
Approximately four months later, Mr. Stewart left respondent’s firm for other
employment. Mr. Stewart specifically advised respondent’s secretary that he was
leaving the succession file. The file sat unattended for several months in
respondent’s office. </p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Subsequently, Mrs. Emanuel learned that incorrect advice given by Mr. Stewart
resulted in creditors foreclosing on certain succession property. As a result,
Mrs. Emanuel filed a disciplinary complaint against Mr. Stewart for mishandling
the succession. The ODC ultimately closed its investigation into the complaint
because Mr. Stewart was not admitted to the bar at the time of the misconduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">However, the ODC initiated its own investigation into respondent’s conduct,
based on his failure to supervise Mr. Stewart during the time in question. As a
result of this investigation, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against
respondent alleging violations of Rules <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.1 --#">1.1</a> (incompetence), 
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.2 --#">1.2</a> (lack of due
diligence), <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE5.1 --#">5.1</a> (failure of attorney to supervise a subordinate attorney) and
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE5.3 --#">5.3</a> (failure to properly supervise a non lawyer assistant) of the Rules of
Professional Conduct. Subsequently, it amended the formal charges to include a
violation of Rule <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE5.5 --#">5.5</a> (assisting a nonmember of the bar to engage in the
unauthorized practice of law). Respondent filed answers denying any misconduct
on his part. </p>
<h3>Formal Hearing</h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">At the formal hearing, Mr. Stewart testified Mrs. Emanuel knew he was
unlicensed and that he could not formally begin the succession proceedings until
his admission to the bar. He maintained, prior to his admission, he had only
gathered information and conducted research. He conceded he gave Mrs. Emanuel
erroneous legal advice regarding the property, but stated respondent was unaware
he had given this advice. Mr. Stewart testified respondent had instructed him
not to give any legal advice, but noted that respondent did not make any
attempts to determine whether he had given advice to her during their meeting,
which occurred in respondent’s absence.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">John Taylor, an attorney who shared office space with respondent during the
time in question, testified he was present when respondent and Mr. Stewart
initially met with Mrs. Emanuel. He corroborated Mr. Stewart’s testimony that
respondent made it clear he wanted no role in the succession matter. Mr. Taylor
stated he personally cautioned Mr. Stewart on the limits of what could be done
on the file prior to his bar admission because he was concerned respondent
allowed Mr. Stewart to meet with Mrs. Emanuel in private.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent testified Mrs. Emanuel knew he had no interest in handling her
case. As to his referring the matter to Mr. Stewart, respondent asserted he
never thought he placed his client at risk because he believed the case was a
simple succession matter that would not require any initial legal advice.
Respondent stated he had no knowledge Mr. Stewart had given erroneous legal
advice, and that he was unaware there were any problems with the succession
until the complaint was filed against Mr. Stewart. As to the letter of
representation forwarded to Mrs. Emanuel, respondent alleged he was only
generally made aware of the contents of the letter by telephone, whereupon he
instructed his secretary to sign and mail the letter out. He maintained that had
he known the full contents of the letter, he probably would not have sent the
letter out. While he asserted he did not violate the Rules of Professional
Conduct, respondent admitted if he had known about the problem earlier, he would
have stepped in to do something about it. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">In mitigation, respondent noted, at the time in question, his wife was suffering
from a terminal illness. He traveled to New Orleans after work each day, where
she was hospitalized, and returned each evening to care for his children. His
wife passed away soon after.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- ">Recommendation of the Hearing Committee</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The hearing committee determined the ODC failed to sustain its burden of
proving respondent’s conduct rose to the level of a professional violation. In
support, the committee noted respondent made it clear to all involved that he
would not handle the succession. Moreover, it pointed out Mr. Stewart never
informed respondent he had given advice to the heirs, and respondent never knew,
or had reason to know, that Mr. Stewart had given the legal advice. Further, it
stated Mr. Stewart accepted responsibility for his actions and their
consequences. Finally, the committee recognized no member of the public had made
a complaint against respondent for the problems associated with the succession.
Accordingly, it dismissed the charges pending against respondent.</p>
<h3><a href="#!-- #ID:00-DB-029.hc --#">Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board</a></h3>
<p class="Bodycopy">The disciplinary board determined the hearing committee properly concluded
the ODC failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence respondent violated
Rules <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.1 --#">1.1</a></span> (incompetence),
<span class="Rules"> 
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE1.2 --#">1.2</a></span> (lack of due diligence) and<span class="Rules"> 
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE5.5 --#">5.5</a>(a) </span>(assisting a
non lawyer in the unauthorized practice of law). However, the board found the
committee erred in failing to find violations of Rules <span class="Rules"> 
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE5.1 --#">5.1</a></span> (failure of attorney
to supervise a subordinate attorney) and <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE5.3 --#">5.3</a></span> (failure to properly supervise a
non lawyer assistant).</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As a threshold matter, the board determined there was an attorney-client
relationship between respondent and Mrs. Emanuel. In support, it relied on the
lengthy letter of representation forwarded to Mrs. Emanuel, as well as the
letters directed to the notary and witnesses to the will, all of which were sent
under respondent’s signature.<span style="vertical-align: super"><a href="#fn1"><font size="1">1</font></a></span> In light of this attorney-client relationship,
the board determined respondent failed to supervise Mr. Stewart’s work in the
succession matter, in violation of Rule <span class="Rules"> <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE5.3 --#">5.3</a>(b)</span>. Although the board recognized
respondent advised Mr. Stewart not to give legal advice prior to his bar
admission, it pointed out respondent took no measures to determine what
transpired at the meeting between Mrs. Emanuel and Mr. Stewart in his absence.
It found respondent’s failure to supervise was further demonstrated by the fact
respondent was “only generally made aware of” the contents of the letter of
representation drafted by Mr. Stewart and that he testified he would not have
sent it out had he known the full contents of the letter. Thus, although it
recognized respondent may not have known of the erroneous legal advice given by
Mr. Stewart at the time, the board found his negligent failure to supervise Mr.
Stewart resulted in actual harm to his client.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The board also determined respondent violated Rule
<span class="Rules"> 
<a href="#!-- #ID:RULE5.1 --#">5.1</a>(b)</span> when he failed to
make reasonable efforts to ensure Mr. Stewart conformed to the Rules of
Professional Conduct once Mr. Stewart was admitted to the bar. In support, the
board stated respondent took no effort to oversee Mr. Stewart’s handling of the
succession matter. It noted respondent reviewed pieces of the file, but he never
reviewed the file in its entirety, even after Mr. Stewart left the firm.
Therefore, the board concluded respondent negligently breached duties owed to
his client, causing the succession to pay $9,292.91 to redeem the seized
property. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">As aggravating factors, the board recognized respondent’s refusal to
acknowledge the wrongful nature of his misconduct, his substantial experience in
the practice of law (admitted in 1975) and his indifference to making
restitution. As mitigating factors, the board noted the absence of selfish
motive and respondent’s personal or emotional problems stemming from the illness
and death of his wife, as well as his good character and reputation. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Relying on Standard 7.3 of the ABA’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions
and jurisprudence from this court, the board determined that a reprimand is the
baseline sanction for respondent’s misconduct. However, it deviated upward to
impose a short suspension due to respondent’s complete indifference to the
matter and the significant injury to his client. Accordingly, it recommended a
sixty-day suspension. </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent filed an objection to the imposition of a sanction. As a result,
the case was docketed for briefing and argument in accordance with Supreme Court
Rule XIX, §11(G).</p>
<p align="center"><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p class="Bodycopy">The record supports the disciplinary board’s conclusion that an
attorney-client relationship existed between Mrs. Emanuel and respondent.
Despite respondent’s assertions that he did not take the case, he authorized the
sending of a letter to his client in his name assuming the representation, and
sent letters to other persons in his capacity as attorney for Mrs. Emanuel.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">While respondent may have not been directly responsible for the incorrect legal
advice given by Mr. Stewart to Mrs. Emanuel, we find he breached his
professional obligation to Mrs. Emanuel by failing to properly supervise Mr.
Stewart. Respondent essentially turned the case over to Mr. Stewart, knowing at
the time that Mr. Stewart was not licensed to practice law in Louisiana and was
unfamiliar with Louisiana succession law. Respondent did not speak with Mrs.
Emanuel after his initial meeting, nor did he review her file.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Under these circumstances, we conclude respondent breached his fundamental
obligations to Mrs. Emanuel under Rules <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE5.1 --#">5.1</a>(b)
and <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE5.3 --#">5.3</a>(b) to ensure the actions of his
non-lawyer assistant (and later subordinate attorney) conformed to the rules of
professional conduct. Although the evidence indicated respondent did not know
Mr. Stewart gave the incorrect advice to Mrs. Emanuel, respondent, as the
client’s attorney, retains compete responsibility for the representation. As we
explained in <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Edwins</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:540%20So.2d%20294 --#">540 So. 2d 294</a>, 299 (La. 1989)</span>:</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">A lawyer often delegates tasks to clerks, secretaries, and other laypersons.
Such delegation is proper if the lawyer maintains a direct relationship with his
client, supervises the delegated work, and has complete professional
responsibility for the work product . . . A lawyer cannot delegate his
professional responsibility to a law student employed in his office . . .The
student in all his work must act as agent for the lawyer employing him, who must
supervise his work and be responsible for his good conduct.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">See also<i> <span class="CITE">Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Keys</span></i><span class="CITE">,
<a href="#!-- #ID:567%20So.2d%20588 --#">567 So. 2d 588</a> (La. 1990) </span>(thirty day
suspension imposed on an attorney, who failed to supervise secretary’s use of
$42,400 in client funds from a succession account for office operating
expenses). </p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Having found respondent violated Rules <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE5.1 --#">5.1</a>(b)
and <a href="#!-- #ID:RULE5.3 --#">5.3</a>(b) in failing to supervise Mr.
Stewart’s handling of the matter, the sole question remaining is the appropriate
sanction for this misconduct. In making a determination of the appropriate
sanction, we are mindful that the purpose of lawyer disciplinary proceedings is
not primarily to punish the lawyer, but rather to maintain appropriate standards
of professional conduct to safeguard the public, to preserve the integrity of
the legal profession, and to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of
the standards of the profession. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Guidry</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:571%20So.2d%20161 --#">571 So. 2d 161</a> (La. 1990)</span>. The
discipline to be imposed depends upon the facts of each case and the seriousness
of the offenses involved, considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating
circumstances. <span class="CITE"> <i>Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Whittington</i>,
<a href="#!-- #ID:459%20So.2d%20520 --#">459 So. 2d 520</a> (La. 1984)</span>.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Respondent’s misconduct caused actual harm to his client, causing the
succession to pay nearly $10,000 to redeem the foreclosed property. Aggravating
factors are present, including respondent’s refusal to acknowledge the wrongful
nature of his misconduct and his substantial experience in the practice of law.
We also recognize the presence of mitigating factors, including respondent’s
personal problems and the lack of a dishonest or selfish motive.</p>
<p class="Bodycopy">Having considered these factors, we conclude the appropriate sanction for
respondent’s misconduct is a sixty-day suspension from the practice of law. </p>
<h2>DECREE</h2>
<p class="Bodycopy">Upon consideration of the record, briefs and oral argument, it is ordered
that R. Neal Wilkinson be suspended from the practice of law for a period of
sixty days. All costs and expenses in the matter are assessed against respondent
in accordance with Supreme Court Rule XIX, §10.1, with legal interest to
commence thirty days from the date of finality of this court’s judgment until
paid.</p>
