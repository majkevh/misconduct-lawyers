100.html,20603,John Walsh,,Censure,9/29/2000,,"John A. Walsh (WSBA No. 20603, admitted 1991), of Seattle, has been ordered censured pursuant to a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board on September 29, 2000. This discipline is based on Mr. Walshâ€™s violation of a court order during a jury trial.In April 1996, Mr. Walsh represented a client in a criminal jury trial. The client was charged with second-degree assault against his wife. During the trial, Mr. Walsh called the wife as a defense witness and asked if she had ever testified in a domestic violence matter. After the prosecutor objected, the trial judge ruled that the answer to the question was inadmissible character evidence. Mr. Walsh then asked the witness if her former husband had been convicted of domestic violence. After the prosecutor objected to this question, Mr. Walsh shouted and pointed his finger at the witness, who then answered ""yes.""The court subsequently found Mr. Walsh in contempt of court and sanctioned him $500. Mr. Walsh paid the sanction. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s contempt findings and sanction.Mr. Walshâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 3.4(c), requiring lawyers to obey rules of the tribunal; and 8.4(d), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.Jean K.

Ferreira (WSBA No. 20646, admitted 1991), of Vancouver, received a censure pursuant to a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board on April 13, 2001. This discipline is based on Mr. Ferreiraâ€™s failure to avoid conflicts of interest and failure to keep his clients informed of all settlement offers in 1996 and 1997.In 1993, Mr. and Mrs. G and Mr. L purchased neighboring undeveloped lots in Seattle. The developers and the engineering consultant allegedly told the Gs and Mr. L that their lots did not contain fill; however, both lots contained fill, which increased the construction costs. Both the Gs and Mr. L also had problems with the builders.In June 1996, the Gs retained Mr. Ferreira to represent them in claims against the developers, consultants and builders. Mr. Ferreira filed two lawsuits for the Gs in summer 1996. He also met with Mr. L and added him as a plaintiff in the lawsuits. There was a dispute between Mr. L and Mr. Ferreira about whether Mr. L had a claim against the consultant. Mr. Ferreira also agreed to represent Mr. B, another neighbor, who had a claim only against the developers. Mr. G told Mr. Ferreira that Mr. G would pay Mr. Ferreiraâ€™s bill and collect a contribution from his neighbors Mr. L. and Mr. B. Mr. Ferreira did not obtain a written waiver of conflict of interest from any of these clients. He also did not discuss with them how any proceeds would be disbursed or divided.In December 1996, Mr. Ferreira obtained a default judgment against the builder. The builder stopped doing business and the clients did not recover any damages. In November 1997, the builder agreed to settle the claims by tendering the amount remaining on its bond. Mr. Ferreira prepared a stipulation that paid the entire bond proceed, $2,751.15, to the Gs. Mr. L received a copy of the stipulation and did not indicate that he disagreed. During this time, Mr. L was periodically incapacitated for health reasons; however, Mr. Ferreira did not know about the incapacity.On December 15, 1997, the court exonerated the bond and Mr. Ferreira disbursed the proceeds to the Gs without notifying Mr. L that he had received the funds.Mr. Ferrieraâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.7(b), prohibiting representing clients whose interests conflict; 1.8(g), prohibiting lawyers from making an aggregate settlement without involving all clients in the settlement; and 1.2(a), requiring lawyers to abide by clientsâ€™ decisions whether to accept a settlement offer.Jonathan Burke represented the Bar Association.

102.html,20884,Roland Foster-Balloun,,Disbarment,5/27/1999,,"Roland O. Foster Balloun (WSBA No. 20884, admitted 1991) has been disbarred, following a hearing, by order of the Supreme Court, effective May 27, 1999. The discipline is based upon multiple acts of misconduct involving litigation matters.Matter 1. In 1992, Mr. Balloun filed a complaint on behalf of his client, Skilcraft Fiberglass Inc., regarding a contract a dispute with Hermanson Corporation and a mechanicâ€™s lien foreclosure action against the Boeing Company. Mr. Balloun notified Hermansonâ€™s counsel that he would move for default against all defendants unless Hermanson filed a release of lien bond. On this same day, Hermanson filed a release of lien bond for twice the disputed value. This bond released Boeingâ€™s real property from any lien claim. Hermansonâ€™s counsel requested that Mr. Balloun dismiss Boeing from the suit. Mr. Balloun told Herman-sonâ€™s counsel that he believed he had no choice other than to drop Boeing from the lawsuit. Later, Mr. Balloun discovered what he decided were intentional errors in Hermansonâ€™s bond. Mr. Balloun obtained an ex parte default judgment against Boeing, without providing notice to Hermanson. Although both Herman-son and Boeing requested that Mr. Balloun agree to vacate the default, he refused. The court vacated the judgment and awarded $22,047.99 in CR 11 sanctions against Balloun and his client. Mr. Balloun appealed the judgment. The Court of Appeals, finding the appeal frivolous, awarded $7,337 in attorneyâ€™s fees. Mr. Balloun has not paid any of the sanctions or attorneyâ€™s fees awards.Matter 2. In April 1992, Mr. Balloun agreed to represent two minority shareholders of a small company in a dispute with the majority shareholder. On Mr. Ballounâ€™s advice, his clients called an emergency Board of Directors meeting ousting the majority shareholder, without giving the statutorily required notice to the majority shareholder.On April 9, 1992, the majority share-holderâ€™s wife filed a petition for dissolution of their marriage. Mr. Balloun submitted a pleading in the dissolution case falsely declaring that he had been retained by a majority of the company stockholders. At about this time, Mr. Balloun began a sexual relationship with the wife. The majority shareholder filed a lawsuit, and the court granted a restraining order against the company, preventing any action implementing the decisions made at the earlier board meeting. Mr. Balloun wrote to the majority shareholdersâ€™ counsel stating that the majority shareholder was only entitled to vote one half of his shares and that the wife was entitled to vote the remaining half. The lawyer objected and advised Mr. Balloun that the majority shareholder had terminated him as corporate counsel. On that same day, Mr. Balloun filed a notice of appearance as counsel for the company. Later, at a special shareholders meeting, with the majority shareholder only allowed to vote one half of his shares, the shareholders voted to remove the majority shareholder, install the wife as president, and retain Mr. Balloun as counsel.The company settled the lawsuit for $20,000. The clients wanted to use the companyâ€™s $9,000 previously deposited into Mr. Ballounâ€™s trust account to make the final settlement payment. Mr. Balloun told the clients that he had disbursed the $9,000 to himself to pay attorneyâ€™s fees for the company and for the minority shareholders personally. After Mr. Ballounâ€™s resignation as counsel, the company received a writ of garnishment for the remaining settlement funds. Mr. Balloun advised the clients that they did not have to respond to the garnishment because it was served after the day he resigned. The court granted a default judgment against the company for $10,000. During this same time period, Mr. Balloun substituted as attorney for the wife in the dissolution, and then made a formal demand against the company on her behalf. Mr. Balloun did not seek or receive the companyâ€™s agreement to represent the wife, and used information obtained during his representation of the company against the company in his representation of the wife.Matter 3. In February 1993, Mr. Balloun agreed to perform 40 hours of legal work per month for a client, in exchange for use of furnished office space owned by the client. The employment agreement stated that all files, correspondence, pleadings and attorney work product would remain on the clientâ€™s property and be readily available to the client. Later, the client terminated Mr. Ballounâ€™s representation, gave him a notice to vacate the property, and asked that he immediately return all files, except one. Mr. Balloun indicated that he would return all files that week. Several months later, while responding to a lawsuit, the clientâ€™s new lawyer was unable to locate several documents that should have been in the clientâ€™s legal files. Mr. Balloun filed a declaration with the court stating that he had returned ""virtually all files,"" except duplicated copies and work product to his former client. The court ordered Mr. Balloun to return all non-privileged files and arrange for an in-camera review of privileged files. Mr. Balloun then turned over 24 files, consisting of about 1,300 non-privileged documents, including stock certificates, birth certificates and promissory notes. After the court issued an order to show cause, Mr. Balloun produced the alleged privileged documents, including pleadings, letters and handwritten notes relevant to the partiesâ€™ intent in the lawsuit.During the investigation of these cases, Mr. Balloun failed to respond to requests for response and failed to provide subpoenaed documents.Mr. Ballounâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 3.3 (f), candor toward the tribunal; 3.4(c), fairness to opposing counsel; 4.4, respect for rights of third persons; 8.4(c), conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; 1.15, withdrawal; 1.1, competence; 1.14(b)(4), trust accounting rules; 1.7(b), conflict of interest; 1.9(a) and (b), conflict of interest-former client; and 2.8(a), non-cooperation.Mr. Balloun represented himself.

The discipline is based upon his admission that the Bar Association could prove that he knowingly converted client funds from his trust account in 2000.Between January and August 2000, Mr. Batson removed $49,314.40 from his trust account. These funds, which did not belong to Mr. Batson, were paid to himself and others for office expenses. Between February 4 and April 10, 2000, Mr. Batson failed to disburse a clientâ€™s share of settlement proceeds, telling the client that the funds had not been received. When the client found out that Mr. Batson had the funds, and then confronted him, Mr. Batson wrote him a check that was not supported by sufficient funds. Later, the client did receive the funds. Mr. Batson did not admit the allegations in the stipulation, but agreed that if the case proceeded to hearing, the Bar Association would be able to prove the allegations.Mr. Batsonâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.14, requiring lawyers to preserve the identity of client funds; and 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.Joy McLean represented the Bar Association.

1039.html,16307,Kevin Healy,,Resignation in Lieu of Disbarment,8/13/2008,,"Kevin G. Healy (WSBA No. 16307, admitted 1986), of Seattle, resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective August 13, 2008. Kevin G. Healy is to be distinguished from Kevin M. Healy of Sacramento. In connection with his resignation in lieu of disbarment, Mr. Healy admitted that the WSBA could prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence sufficient violations of the Rules of Professional conduct to result in his disbarment, but did not admit any specific misconduct. The misconduct and violations described in the Statement of Alleged Misconduct (none of which is specifically admitted by Mr. Healy) are as follows: At all relevant times, Mr. Healy owned, managed, and operated two limited liability companies. Between 1989 and 2007, Mr. Healy had attorney-client relationships with six individuals (including two married couples). During the course of and as a result of these attorney-client relationships, Mr. Healy learned that these individuals all had substantial assets. Beginning in 2006, Mr. Healy convinced one married couple to refinance their home to obtain $160,000 and invest that sum in his company. He later solicited an additional investment of $67,000 from the same couple. Mr. Healy convinced the coupleâ€™s son and daughter-in-law to also refinance their home to obtain $200,000 and invest that sum in his company. In 2006 and 2007, Mr. Healy solicited contributions in the amounts of $500,000 and $400,000 from two other clients or former clients, and a total of $300,000 from two other individuals. Based upon Mr. Healyâ€™s representations, the two clients and two other individuals used their residences to borrow the money that they loaned to Mr. Healy. Mr. Healy convinced one client, who was a 92-year-old widow, to form a limited liability company for the sole purpose of inducing her to invest over $1,425,000 of her personal funds in his company by refinancing her previously un-mortgaged home and by liquidating her life savings. Mr. Healy told the investors that he would use the investment monies to purchase and renovate properties between Seattle and Tacoma situated at or near a light-rail line. Mr. Healy documented the transactions in unsecured promissory notes (with the exception of one client, who received no documentation for his $400,000 loan). The promissory notes included provisions that Mr. Healy would make all principal and interest payments each month on the loans, would pay the principal of the loans off by certain dates, and individuals would receive additional cash. Mr. Healy told one client who wanted his loan secured by real property that he would receive a deed in real property to hold as part of the loan transaction. In April 2007, Mr. Healy gave the client a statutory warranty deed to an apartment building in Tacoma, but specifically told the client not to record the deed, thereby providing no security interest for the client.Mr. Healy never informed these individuals that his companies had substantial debts or of the risks involved in the investments, nor did he suggest that they seek the advice of independent counsel before investing their money. The terms of the investment transactions were not fair and reasonable. Mr. Healy told many of these individuals that their investments would be perfectly safe. He made such statements as â€œtrustworthiness is the heart of this dealâ€ and â€œI would not do this deal if I did not trust you and feel in turn that you trust me.â€ He declared in written statements that even his brother was refinancing his home to invest in the company.Beginning in October 2007, Mr. Healy failed to make payments as required under the terms of his promissory note with one of the individuals. After January 2008, Mr. Healy had failed to make payments as required under the financial agreements with the other individuals. Mr. Healy owes debts to nine individuals, each debt ranging between $190,000 and $1,425,000.The violations stated in the Statement of Alleged Misconduct constitute a violation of RPC 1.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer from entering into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquiring an ownership, possessory, security, or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless the transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable, the client is advised in writing and given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel, and the client gives informed consent; RPC 1.8(b), prohibiting a lawyer from using information relating to representation of a client to the disadvantage of the client unless the client gives informed consent; RPC 1.9(c), prohibiting a lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter, or whose present or former firm has formerly represented a client in a matter, from thereafter using information relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the client or from revealing information relating to the representation, except as permitted by the rules; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Kathleen A.T.

104.html,21088,Frederick Merrill,,Censure,11/17/2000,,"Frederick H. Merrill (WSBA No. 21088, admitted 1991), of Everett, has been censured pursuant to a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board on November 17, 2000. This discipline is based on his placing misleading advertisements during 1997 and 1998.Matter 1: Mr. Merrill graduated from law school in May 1990 and was sworn into practice in November 1991. Prior to being admitted to the Bar, Mr. Merrill held several positions in the criminal justice system, including juvenile and adult counselor, prison guard, parole officer and community corrections officer. In these positions, Mr. Merrill had extensive contact with courts and testified in many proceedings.In 1997, Mr. Merrillâ€™s yellow pages advertisement stated ""17 yearsâ€™ court experience."" His 1998 advertisement claimed ""over 20 yearsâ€™ court experience."" In 1997, Mr. Merrill had been practicing law for six years. Originally, Mr. Merrill drafted his ad to include his prison and probation experience. Another lawyer told Mr. Merrill that the ad was too complicated and suggested that he only include the number of years of law practice. Mr. Merrill believed that the statements were true, combining his years as a lawyer with his prior experience, and did not intend to mislead the public. When the Bar Association contacted Mr. Merrill, he immediately asked the yellow page advertisers to delete the misleading language.Matter 2: In October 1997, Mr. Merrill agreed to represent a client charged with child molestation. The client found Mr. Merrill through the yellow pages, and relied on the statement that he had 17 yearsâ€™ court experience. Following a jury trial, the court convicted the client. Mr. Merrill declined to represent the client on appeal or in a motion for a new trial, and subsequently a public defender was appointed to represent the client. This new lawyer discovered that Mr. Merrill was admitted in 1991 and discussed this with the client. The client indicated that he would not have retained Mr. Merrill if he had not believed that he had been a lawyer for 17 years. The court denied the clientâ€™s motion for a new trial, and his appeal.In October 1997, Mr. Merrill agreed to represent a second client who had also been charged with child molestation. The clientâ€™s civil lawyer recommended several criminal lawyers, but none were available to take the case. The client saw Mr. Merrillâ€™s yellow pages ad and contacted him, assuming that Mr. Merrill had been practicing law for 17 years. Mr. Merrill charged the client a $12,000 nonrefundable fee.In March 1998, based on Mr. Merrillâ€™s recommendation, the client pleaded guilty as charged and enrolled in the Sexual Offender Special Sentencing Alternative program. During this time, Mr. Merrillâ€™s clients met in jail. The second client learned from the first that Mr. Merrill was licensed to practice law in 1991. The second client stated that he would not have retained Mr. Merrill had he known Mr. Merrill had not practiced law for 17 years.Mr Merrillâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 7.1(a), prohibiting lawyer communications about their services from containing misrepresented facts or omitted facts necessary to prevent the statements considered as a whole from being materially misleading; and 7.1(b), prohibiting lawyer communications about their services from containing statements likely to create an unjustified expectation about results the lawyer can achieve.Leslie Allen represented the Bar Association.

Lundahl (WSBA No. 21424, admitted 1992), of Tacoma, has been suspended for 30 days by order of the Supreme Court approving a stipulation effective May 15, 2000. This discipline is based upon wrongful acceleration and miscalculation of his attorneyâ€™s fees from 1993 to 1999.In August 1993, Mr. C hired Mr. Lundahl to represent him in a wrongful-termination suit. Mr. C signed a contingent-fee agreement and gave Mr. Lundahl a $1,000 advance on costs; however, Mr. Lundahl did not deposit the advance in a trust account. In November or December 1993, Mr. Lundahl asked, and Mr. C orally agreed, that $850 of the advance could be applied to Mr. Lundahlâ€™s current attorneyâ€™s fees. Mr. Lundahl retained two experts who required advance retainers, and Mr. C gave Mr. Lundahl $2,500 for the retainers. Mr. Lundahlâ€™s fee agreement permitted him to hire associate counsel, and in August 1994 he hired Mr. J to assist him.The settlement took place on October 18, and Mr. C was to receive a structured settlement of $150,000 over two years. Mr. Lundahl received Mr. Câ€™s first payment of $15,000 on or about November 28, 1994. He opened a trust account for the settlement proceeds, paid approximately $5,500 in costs and expert fees, and retained the balance as part of his attorneyâ€™s fees. He did not send an accounting or any of the funds to Mr. C.In December 1994, Mr. C asked Mr. Lundahl if any money remained after expenses, stating that Mr. Lundahl told him he would send a little money but had not done so. Mr. Lundahl received the second $15,000 on or about December 28, 1994. He paid expert fees of $2,289.37 and applied the remainder to attorneyâ€™s fees, using $4,000 to pay Mr. J. In late February 1995, Mr. C wrote Mr. Lundahl and asked for an accounting. In March 1995, Mr. Lundahl sent Mr. C his ledger sheet for the settlement funds and a list of the costs paid to date. The list contained some mathematical errors.In late June 1995, Mr. Lundahl received a third check for $30,000, which he deposited into the trust account on July 10. On July 11, he removed $1,000 from the trust account, and on July 19, he transferred approximately $26,000 from the trust account into his general business account, which he used for personal bills. On the same date, he sent Mr. C two checks totaling $2,267.39 and an accounting of fund disbursements. According to the accounting, Mr. Lundahl retained $50,000 as his attorneyâ€™s fees.After receiving the accounting, Mr. C contacted Mr. J, who filed a motion for an accounting and for an order that all settlement funds be deposited with the court. During a deposition, Mr. Lundahl testified that he had Mr. Câ€™s oral agreement to accelerate his attorneyâ€™s fees, and stated that the written fee agreement also gave him the right to accelerate fees; however, the fee agreement did not give him this right. During the deposition, Mr. Lundahl stated he was not aware of RPC1.5(c)(2), requiring a structured contingent fee to be calculated based on the present value, not the full value of the settlement. Mr. Lundahl also miscalculated the fees at 33-1/3 percent when the fee agreement entitled him to 33 percent, or $49,500. Disciplinary counsel advised Mr. Lundahl that if there was a dispute over accelerated fees, the disputed funds should be placed in the trust account, and the dispute should be solved by mediation, arbitration or litigation.On September 19, 1995, Mr. Lundahl wrote Mr. C, stating he had miscalculated his attorneyâ€™s fees and he owed Mr. C an additional $3,235.66. He stated the amount was in the trust account and he offered it as a full settlement. Mr. C did not accept the offer due to his position that Mr. Lundahl had wrongfully accelerated his fees. Mr. C ultimately received the rest of the settlement payments.In December 1997, Mr. C and Mr. J sued Mr. Lundahl, alleging negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, breach of contract, and for quantum meruit. Mr. Lundahl counterclaimed against Mr. C for breach of contract and against Mr. J for interference with a contractual relationship. The matter was referred to mandatory arbitration, and a hearing was held on July 29 and July 31, 1998. Mr. Lundahl testified he had obtained Mr. Câ€™s oral agreement to accelerate his fees, stating that after the grievance was filed, he realized he had been wrong to accelerate his fees because he did not have a written agreement to do so.The arbitration decision was entered on August 15, 1998. The arbitrator found that Mr. Lundahl had wrongfully accelerated his fees, and he awarded Mr. C the statutory interest rate on the fees, prejudgement interest, and attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. He also awarded Mr. C the $500, which Mr. Lundahl admitted he took by mistake when he used a 33-1/3 percent calculation instead of 33 percent. The arbitrator awarded Mr. J $16,500 (less the $5,000 already received) for his work on the case. The judgment on the arbitratorâ€™s decision was entered on September 25, 1998. Mr. Lundahl paid both Mr. C and Mr. J in or near March 1999.Mr. Lundahlâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.5(c)(2), requiring lawyers to calculate their contingent percentage on the present value of a settlement if part of the settlement is to be paid in the future; and 1.14(b)(4), requiring lawyers to promptly pay client funds upon request.Leslie Allen represented the Bar Association.

This discipline resulted from conduct involving failure to communicate, failure to abide by a client's decisions, and trust account violations.Matter No. 1: A Bar Association audit of Mr. Moody's trust account for the period of January 1, 2003, to February 29, 2004, and a second audit for the period from March 1, 2004, through August 31, 2006, disclosed a number of problems related to Mr. Moody's handling of his trust account:â€¢ Failure to maintain complete records of all funds in trust; â€¢ Failure to maintain individual client records;â€¢ Actual deposits into Mr. Moody's trust account did not track the purported deposits into trust identified in his ""Funds with Running Balances Reports"";â€¢ Funds were withdrawn from Mr. Moody's client trust account without substantiating or identifying his entitlement to the funds; and â€¢ Mr. Moody did not reconcile his trust account bank statements with his check register.Matter No. 2: In June 2002, Mr. Moody agreed to represent a client in a dissolution matter. The client had been arrested and incarcerated following an argument with his wife, and remained incarcerated during the entire dissolution proceeding. While representing the client, Mr. Moody engaged in the following conduct:â€¢ Following a sale of the client's family home, Mr. Moody deposited all or a portion of the client's home sale proceeds into his general business account when the funds had not all been earned.â€¢ Mr. Moody failed to abide by the client's decision to reject the proposed property settlement and go to trial, and instead entered into the final property settlement in the client's dissolution without the client's authorization.Mr. Moody's conduct violated RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation and consult with a client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions about the representation; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited into one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts maintained as set forth by the rules and no funds of the lawyer be deposited therein; and former RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of a lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them.Leslie C.

Clyne (WSBA No. 21556, admitted 1992), of Seattle, has been ordered censured pursuant to a Stipulation to Censure approved by the Disciplinary Board on March 15, 2000. This discipline is based on Mr. Clyneâ€™s failure to keep non-client funds separate from client funds in a lawyer trust account.Mr. Clyne attended law school with Barbara Beatty. While in school, Mr. Clyne worked as a legal assistant for Ms. Beatty. After passing the bar exam, Mr. Clyne worked as an associate for Ms. Beatty. In the summer of 1992, Ms. Beatty began soliciting investors in a real estate project to build four single-family residences. Ms. Beatty had real estate experience and acted as the project developer. Mr. Clyne has some construction experience. Ms. Beatty asked Mr. Clyne to assist as site advisor. Some of the money from this investment project passed through the lawyer trust account that also contained client funds. Mr. Clyne suggested to Ms. Beatty that they open a separate account for the investment money, but no new account was ever opened. Both Ms. Beattyâ€™s and Mr. Clyneâ€™s signatures were required for trust account checks. Mr. Clyne wrote checks from the trust account for project expenses. In February 1999, Ms. Beatty was sentenced on one count of securities fraud for her role in this investment project.

Furusho (WSBA No. 25055, admitted 1995), of Bellevue, was disbarred, effective August 22, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct involving the commission of a criminal act, making false statements to third persons, and engaging in conduct involving deceit or misrepresentation.Mr. Furusho was the registered agent for a corporation which owned the majority of outstanding shares of stock of another corporation (Corporation E). Corporation E was a publicly traded Washington corporation based in Salt Lake City, Utah, purporting to be a developmental stage company that was in the business of developing coal mining properties in Wyoming. During all material times, Mr. Furusho's legal practice focused in part on securities law. As part of his practice, Mr. Furusho was familiar with securities laws governing restricted stock, exemptions from registration, freely tradable stock, restrictive legends, and opinion letters regarding exemptions from registration requirements. Mr. Furusho agreed to provide an attorney opinion letter to a co-conspirator (Ms. K) for Corporation E stating that the stock of Corporation E complied with an exemption from federal securities registration requirement. On May 9, 2006, Mr. Furusho signed an opinion letter drafted by Ms. K and sent it interstate via facsimile to Corporation E's transfer agent. Mr. Furusho knew the transfer agent would rely on the representations in his opinion letter to re-issue restricted shares of Corporation E's stock as freely tradable stock. The opinion letter falsely stated that:â€¢ The transfer agent could remove the restrictive legends on the shares of Corporation E stock that had been issued to co-conspirators because the stock met an exemption from registration. â€¢ Mr. Furusho had been furnished with, and had examined, ""all such records of the Company, agreements and other instruments, certificates of officers and representatives of the Company, certificates of public officials, and other documentsâ€¦deemedâ€¦necessaryâ€¦as a basis for the opinions."" â€¢ Mr. Furusho had reviewed ""documents and representation letters provided by the Shareholder and the broker involved in this transaction.""Mr. Furusho knew at the time he signed the letter that the statements were false. On or about May 9, 2006, Mr. Furusho and other co-conspirators, pursuant to Mr. Furusho's opinion letter, caused Corporation E's transfer agent to issue 17,390,000 freely tradable shares of Corporation E stock. Between June 7, 2006, and June 8, 2006, Mr. Furusho, by virtue of having issued his opinion letter, and other co-conspirators caused 487,000 freely tradable shares of Corporation E stock to be sold for a total of approximately $88,326. Respondent's actions as described above violated Title 15 United States Code Section 78j(b) (15 U.S.C. Â§ 78j(b)), 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78ff(a), and Title 17 Code of Federal Regulations Section 240.10(b)-5 (17 CFR Â§ 240.10(b)-5), and 18 U.S.C. Â§ 371. During the 2004 tax year, Mr. Furusho received gross income of approximately $146,000. During the 2005 tax year, Mr. Furusho received gross income of approximately $37,000. Mr. Furusho's income during the tax years 2004 and 2005 was substantially in excess of the minimum filing requirements and required Mr. Furusho by law to file an income tax return. Mr. Furusho failed to file income tax returns for the tax years 2004 and 2005 in violation of 26 U.S.C. Â§ 7203, which resulted in tax liability in the amount of $36,600. On November 28, 2007, Mr. Furusho pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to violating of 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78j(b), 3 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78ff(a), 17 CFR 240.10(b)-5, 18 U.S.C. Â§ 371, and 26 U.S.C. Â§ 7203. On December 13, 2007, U.S. District Court entered an acceptance of Plea of Guilty, Adjudication of Guilt and Notice of Sentencing accepting Mr. Furusho's plea of guilty.Mr. Furusho's conduct violated RPC 4.1(a), prohibiting a lawyer in the course of representing a client from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or another act which reflects disregard for the rule of law.Jonathan H.

Willmore (WSBA No. 33459, admitted 2003), of Seattle, was ordered to receive a reprimand on July 11, 2008, by order of a hearing officer following a hearing. This discipline resulted from conduct in three matters involving failure to provide competent representation, lack of diligence, failure to communicate, and trust-fund irregularities.Between 2004 and 2006, Ms. Willmore was hired in three immigration matters to represent clients before both the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). In two matters, Ms. Willmore failed to notify clients of adverse BIA decisions. The clients had 30 days to file appeals to the Ninth Circuit or to agree to voluntary departure; however, as she failed to inform her clients, they were unable to pursue a timely appeal or voluntary departure and became subject to immediate removal. One client was eventually arrested and detained for nine months by immigration officials because he had not voluntarily left the United States or filed an appeal. In the third matter, Ms. Willmore failed to file a clientâ€™s appeal of an adverse immigration judgeâ€™s decision to the BIA within the 30-day deadline, which made the client subject to immediate removal from the United States. Ms. Willmore accepted a $610 check from the client, which was meant in part to pay the $110 filing fee for the appeal. The clientâ€™s check was not deposited into Ms. Willmoreâ€™s trust account, and Ms. Willmore did not pay the $110 filing fee for the BIA appeal. Ms. Willmore finally returned the funds to the client more than a year after receiving them.Ms. Willmoreâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; and 1.14(a), requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm, including advances for costs and expenses, to be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts maintained as set forth in the rules and no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm to be deposited therein.Kevin M.

Rutter II (WSBA No. 21627, admitted 1992), of Bremerton, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective March 12, 2001, following a stipulation. The discipline is based upon his agreement that the Office of Disciplinary Counsel could prove that he signed a judgeâ€™s name to orders without authorization, and testified falsely at a deposition.In July 1998, Mr. Rutter agreed to represent a client in a Nevada lawsuit. The clientâ€™s exwife was claiming the client owed $15,000 in underpaid child support. In July and August, Mr. Rutter told the client that he would get the suit transferred from Nevada to Washington. The client paid Mr. Rutter $1,750 in fees during the representation. In August, the client was served with an order to appear and show cause, requiring him to appear in Nevada on September 15, 1998. The client immediately delivered this order to Mr. Rutter, who told the client that he had a friend in Nevada who would take care of the hearing. Although the client agreed that the friend could appear for him, Mr. Rutter never contacted the friend and no one appeared at the hearing. Mr. Rutter did not file any pleadings prior to the hearing.In Nevada, Judge Fondi found the client in contempt and sentenced him to jail, but suspended the sentence on the condition that he immediately increase his support payments to $250 per month and pay the arrearage. The client received the order by mail and asked Mr. Rutter why his friend had not appeared. Mr. Rutter told the client that his friend had gotten the wrong judge. Mr. Rutter also told the client he would file a motion to reconsider the decision. In February 1999, Mr. Rutter told the client he had scheduled a conference call with the judge to discuss the reconsideration motion. On the day of the conference call, Mr. Rutter told the client that the judge was not available and would take the matter under advisement. In fact, Mr. Rutter had not scheduled a conference call with the judge.In early 1999, Mr. Rutter created an undated ""order for telephonic hearing,"" which has an original ink signature similar to Judge Fondiâ€™s. In April 1999, Mr. Rutter told his client he had received an order reversing the original decision and ruling in the clientâ€™s favor. In fact, there was no such order. The clientâ€™s wife picked up what she believed was a copy of the ""order"" â€” bearing a signature similar to Judge Fondiâ€™s â€” from Mr. Rutterâ€™s office. When the client contacted the clerkâ€™s office in Nevada and asked them to fax the original order, they told the client they did not have an order in the court file. Mr. Rutter filed a motion for reconsideration on May 28, 1999. The motion and declaration are dated January 24, 1999 and bear the clientâ€™s signatures; however, the client did not sign these documents. The client obtained his original file from Mr. Rutter on June 9, 1999 and discovered the original ""order for telephonic hearing"" and ""order on hearing"" in his file.In his August 9, 1999 deposition, Mr. Rutter testified falsely that he had contacted his Nevada friend about the clientâ€™s case, and that he had not signed Judge Fondiâ€™s name on the two orders or his clientâ€™s name on the motion and declaration.Mr. Rutterâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 8.4(b), prohibiting committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; and 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.Kevin M.

Zackey (WSBA No. 21657, admitted 1992), of Bellevue, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective December 12, 2000, following a default hearing. The discipline is based on his disbursing client funds to himself and others, failing to diligently represent several clients, and failing to cooperate with the Bar Association.Matter 1: In July 1996, Mr. Zackey agreed to represent a client injured in a fall at a motel in California. Medicare paid $10,326.05 of the clientâ€™s medical bills and notified Mr. Zackey of its statutory reimbursement right.In May 1999, Mr. Zackey settled the clientâ€™s claim for $50,000. He requested that the client sign a release and told him he was negotiating with the lien holders. The client signed the release, and Mr. Zackey received and deposited the settlement funds into his trust account. The same day, he wrote a $10,000 check to his general office account designated as ""partial fees client v. Motel 6.""Beginning in May 1999, Mr. Zackey stopped responding to his clientâ€™s requests for information. After May 25, 1999, Mr. Zackey disbursed the clientâ€™s remaining funds to himself and third parties unrelated to the case. As of the date of the hearing, Mr. Zackey had not paid the client or the lien holders.In September 1999, Mr. Zackey disbursed $1,000 from the client funds designated as ""cost reimbursement."" Mr. Zackey did not contemporaneously notify the client of these disbursements.Matter 2: In 1996, Mr. Zackey agreed to represent a client injured in an auto accident. In late 1998 or early 1999, Mr. Zackey settled the clientâ€™s case for $4,316. In January 1999, Mr. Zackey deposited the settlement funds into his trust account. Sometime after this date, he disbursed the funds to himself and third parties unrelated to the case. Mr. Zackey did not pay the client or the lien holders.Matter 3: Mr. Zackey agreed to represent a client injured in an auto accident. In 1997 or 1998, Mr. Zackey settled the claim. On April 26, 1998, Mr. Zackey sent the client an accounting indicating he would disburse $25,829.61 to her and $1,992.50 to her insurance company. Mr. Zackey paid the client, but not the insurance company. As of the date of the hearing, Mr. Zackey had not paid the insurance company.Matter 4: Mr. Zackey represented a client in a personal injury claim. The client received chiropractic treatment, and the provider notified Mr. Zackey of his lien. In May 1998, Mr. Zackey settled the clientâ€™s case for $26,000. In January 1999, Mr. Zackey disbursed funds to the client, but did not pay the chiropractic lien. As of the date of the hearing, Mr. Zackey had not paid the lien and had removed the money from his trust account.Matter 5: Mr. Zackey failed to respond to several written requests for information from disciplinary counsel. He also failed to attend a deposition after being served with a subpoena. In February 2000, disciplinary counsel filed a petition for interim suspension of Mr. Zackeyâ€™s license based on his failure to provide requested trust account records and failure to account for client funds.Matter 6: In May 1997, Mr. Zackey agreed to represent a client in a claim for injuries he sustained in an auto accident. The contingent-fee agreement indicated that Mr. Zackey would receive 33.33 percent of all amounts received by the client, less pre-existing PIP payments and medical or insurance liens. The case settled in December 1998 for $66,000. According to the fee agreement and Mahler v. Szucs, 135 Wn.2d 398 (1998), the portion of attorneyâ€™s fees paid by the insurer attributable for recovery of its subrogated claim belonged to the client.In February 1999, Mr. Zackey called the insurance company stating that he was entitled to those fees. In support of his claim Mr. Zackey sent a copy of a fee agreement purportedly between himself and the client. This fee agreement did not include the ""less pre-existing PIP payments and any medical or insurance liens"" language. Mr. Zackey sent $30,472.47 to the client, and notified him that he claimed $6,800 in fees and $100.32 in costs from the amount due the insurance company. Later, Mr. Zackey removed the remaining funds from his trust account.Matter 7: In May 1996, Mr. Zackey agreed to represent a client in a claim for damages as a result of a fall in Ohio. In July 1996, the same client retained Mr. Zackey to represent her for injuries she sustained in a car accident. Mr. Zackey failed to file suit on either claim prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations.Matter 8: Between May 1998 and October 1990, Mr. Zackey used approximately $82,000 in client funds from his trust account to pay his personal obligations and to pay other clients.Mr. Zackeyâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.1, requiring lawyers to competently represent their clients; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep their clients reasonably informed of the status of their matters and to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; 1.5(c)(1), requiring lawyers to provide written disbursal statements in contingent-fee cases, explaining the amount remitted to the client and how that amount is calculated; 1.14(b)(3), requiring lawyers to maintain complete records of all client funds and property in the lawyerâ€™s possession and provide accountings when requested; 8.4(b), prohibiting lawyers from committing criminal acts (RCW 9A.56.030) that reflect adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.Maria Regimbal represented the Bar Association.

This discipline is based upon his failure to act with reasonable diligence, to keep his client reasonably informed, and to provide the explanations necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions from 1996 to 2001.In May 1997, Mr. S was sentenced to a 164-month term for second-degree murder. In June 1999, Mr. S hired Mr. Huffhines to file a petition for review, which was denied on November 2, 1999. Mr. Huffhines did not promptly inform Mr. S of the order denying review.Mr. Huffhines then agreed to file a petition for writ of habeas corpus on Mr. Sâ€™s behalf. On February 3, 2000, Mr. Sâ€™s mother (Ms. S) signed a fee agreement with Mr. Huffhines and paid $2,000. On March 23, she wrote to Mr. Huffhines inquiring about his progress in the matter, and wrote again on November 29, 2000, but Mr. Huffhines did not respond.

McNamara Jardine (WSBA No. 21677, admitted 1992), of Tacoma, was suspended for 90 days following a hearing, by order of the Supreme Court dated May 5, 2000. The discipline is based upon her failure to disclose potentially exculpatory evidence to the defense in a felony vehicular homicide prosecution in 1996. The suspension became effective May 13, 2000.In December 1995, Ms. Jardine, who had handled three or four adult felony trials prior to this one, was assigned to prosecute Mr. D. He was charged with vehicular homicide after hitting and killing the victim as she walked across the street. Both the defense and the prosecution had been told that the victim had a briefcase, but the police did not recover it at the scene. One defense theory was that the victim wore a dark jacket and carried a dark briefcase, obscuring her brightly colored dress from Mr. Dâ€™s view.In November 1995, the defense specifically requested production and identification of the briefcase. The trial was set for January 22, 1996. On January 18, 1996, Ms. Jardine received a photographic reconstruction of the crime scene by a defense expert, showing a mannequin in a red dress wearing a dark jacket and carrying a large dark-colored briefcase. On this same day, the prosecutorâ€™s office located the person who removed the briefcase from the scene, Mr. S.On January 19, 1996, Mr. S brought the briefcase to a meeting with Ms. Jardine. Ms. Jardine told Mr. S that she would not need him as a witness, and he left with the briefcase. Ms. Jardine did not mention the briefcase to defense counsel, but discussed the briefcase with her supervisor. The supervisor instructed Ms. Jardine to disclose the briefcase information to defense counsel, but Ms. Jardine did not do so. During the trial, Ms. Jardine objected to the admission of the defense reconstruction photographs, stating that the briefcase was not accurately portrayed and the depiction was not supported by the evidence. In her closing argument, Ms. Jardine told the jury, ""we donâ€™t even have the briefcase to determine its color."" On January 29, 1996, Mr. D was acquitted by jury verdict. On February 6, 1996, defense counsel learned that Ms. Jardine had the briefcase during the trial.By failing to disclose potentially exculpatory evidence to the defense in a felony prosecution, Ms. Jardineâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 3.4(a) and 3.8(d).Sachia Stonefeld represented the Bar Association.

1104.html,16036,Charles Marunde,,Suspension,9/10/2008,,"Charles E. Marunde (WSBA No. 16036, admitted 1986), of Port Angeles, was suspended for six months, effective September 10, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline is based on conduct in two matters involving failure to act with reasonable diligence, lack of communication, charging unreasonable fees, failure to terminate representation when a mental condition impaired his ability to represent the client, failure to protect a client's interests, failure to expedite litigation, and violation of the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct.Matter No. 1: In May 2006, ""Mr. and Mrs. H"" hired Mr. Marunde to file a lawsuit on their behalf alleging misrepresentation in the purchase of residential real estate. Mr. and Mrs. H paid Mr. Marunde $2,500. Mr. Marunde filed the lawsuit, and a trial was set for December 7, 2006. Mr. Marunde failed to advise Mr. and Mrs. H that the case was set for trial or of the trial date. He failed to advise Mr. and Mrs. H of developments in the litigation, including that they had been countersued. Mr. Marunde failed to provide Mr. and Mrs. H timely notice of the discovery requests being made of them, failed to comply with the case scheduling order, and failed to comply with the defendants' requests for discovery. On or about November 8, 2006, Mr. Marunde advised Mr. and Mrs. H that he would withdraw from their case due to emotional problems. He did not withdraw from the case. On November 15, 2006, defense counsel filed a motion to exclude evidence based on Mr. Marunde's failure to comply with discovery. The motion was set to be heard on December 1, 2006, one week before the scheduled trial. Mr. Marunde failed to advise Mr. and Mrs. H of the motion. In late November 2006, Mr. H contacted another lawyer (Lawyer B) about representing them. Mr. and Mrs. H retrieved their file from Mr. Marunde and learned for the first time about the trial date and pending motion. On December 1, 2006, Lawyer B moved to continue the trial date and presented a declaration from Mr. Marunde in which he stated that he had been unable to attend to Mr. and Mrs. H's case because of emotional problems. The court denied the defendants' motion in limine without prejudice, granted the motion to continue conditioned on the payment of sanctions, and issued a new case scheduling order. The parties agreed to sanctions in the amount of $1,500, thereby obviating the need for another hearing, and Mr. and Mrs. H paid the sanctions.Matter No. 2: In December 2005, a married couple (Mr. and Mrs. S) hired Mr. Marunde to represent them in an action against their neighbors. They paid Mr. Marunde $5,000. There was no written fee agreement. In January 2006, Mr. Marunde filed a complaint on Mr. and Mrs. S's behalf. He did some work on their legal matter over the next two months, then stopped work on the case. Mr. S called Mr. Marunde repeatedly about the status of the case, but Mr. Marunde failed to return his calls. In July 2006, Mr. S went unannounced to Mr. Marunde's home. Mr. Marunde told him he was experiencing personal problems and was depressed. As a result of his problems and resulting inability to handle his cases, Mr. Marunde asked a non-lawyer friend to act as an intermediary between him and some of his clients. Through the friend, Mr. S sought information from Mr. Marunde about his case and demanded a refund of his fees. Mr. Marunde has not refunded any fees to Mr. S.In March 2007, Mr. S hired another lawyer (Lawyer C) and paid him $3,000. The trial was set for early 2008. Mr. S filed a grievance against Mr. Marunde with the Bar Association. In April 2007, disciplinary counsel asked Mr. Marunde to provide a written response to the grievance. Between May and June 2007, the Association sent three additional letters requesting his response to the grievance. Mr. Marunde failed to file a written response. In August 2007, an investigator with the Bar Association interviewed Mr. Marunde about the grievance. Mr. Marunde agreed to provide the Bar Association with his billing statements and copies of documents, which he stored on his computer. In November 2007, after disciplinary counsel sent Mr. Marunde the analysis letter in this case recommending a hearing, Mr. Marunde provided information and documents in response to the grievance. Mr. Marunde's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses; RPC 1.16(a)(2), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the lawyer's physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer's ability to represent the client; RPC 1.16(d), requiring a lawyer, upon termination of representation, to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct [here, ELC 5.3(e)].Joanne S.

1105.html,32549,Theresa Sowinski,,Disbarment,9/10/2008,,"DisbarredTheresa M. Sowinski (WSBA No. 32549, admitted 2002), of Everett, was disbarred, effective September 10, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. Ms. Sowinski affirmatively admitted that the WSBA could prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence sufficient violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct supporting disbarment, including use of client funds for her personal benefit, but did not affirmatively admit all the facts and misconduct herein. This discipline is based on conduct in three matters involving failure to communicate, trust-account irregularities, the commission of criminal acts, and engaging in dishonest conduct that shows disregard for the rule of law and demonstrates unfitness to practice law.Matter No. 1: In 2002, client A retained the law firm where Ms. Sowinski was employed to represent her in a real estate partition matter. The firm filed a lawsuit on behalf of client A. In October 2003, Ms. Sowinski left the firm to start her own firm and continued to handle client Aâ€™s case with client Aâ€™s agreement. In April 2004, a Stipulation and Decree for Partition was filed, which stated, in part, that Ms. Sowinkiâ€™s â€œfees and costs shall be charged against the share to be received by [client A]â€¦.â€ The opposing party was represented by Lawyer B. In June 2004, the property was sold and the net proceeds from the sale, totaling $293,081.09, were transferred into Lawyer Bâ€™s trust account by agreement of the parties. Ms. Sowinski sent Lawyer B a fax indicating that her client had an outstanding balance of $12,564.06 for attorneyâ€™s fees, a portion of which was owed to Ms. Sowinkiâ€™s former firm. Lawyer B issued a check in the amount of $105,000 directly to client A. This payment constituted an advance to be deducted from client Aâ€™s total share of the proceeds. That same day, Lawyer B issued a separate check in the amount of $12,564.06 to Ms. Sowinskiâ€™s firm for client Aâ€™s legal fees. This amount was to be charged against client Aâ€™s total share of the proceeds.  Ms. Sowinski deposited the $12,564.06 check into her business account, which was not a trust account, and issued a check in the amount of $2,795.20 to her former firm for client Aâ€™s legal fees. On July 12, 2004, Ms. Sowinski issued a billing statement indicating that client A owed $540 in outstanding legal fees. On August 12, 2004, Ms. Sowinski called client A and requested $5,000 for legal fees. Client A gave Ms. Sowinski a check in the amount of $5,000, which she deposited into her business account even though Ms. Sowinski had not yet billed the client for fees beyond $540.In October 2004, Lawyer B wrote a letter to Ms. Sowinski stating that, after calculating legal fees and additional expenses related to the property, client A would receive a final settlement of $112,010.14, which was in addition to any funds previously disbursed to client A (directly or to her counsel). Lawyer B issued a cashierâ€™s check in the amount of $112,010.14 payable to â€œTheresa Sowinski â€” Attorney for [client A].â€ Ms. Sowinski deposited the check into her business account and told client A that she would issue a check to her in the amount of $102,010.14. Client A did not receive such a check. In November 2004, Ms. Sowinski and Lawyer B filed a Stipulation and Order for Dismissal with Prejudice and Without Costs. In December 2004, Ms. Sowinski gave Client A a check for $50,000 and informed client A that there was still some money to disburse, but that she had to keep some of it for â€œoutstanding bills.â€ Client A attempted to obtain an accounting and the rest of her money, which Ms. Sowinski agreed to provide but never did. In March 2005, client A hired a new lawyer to assist her in obtaining an accounting from Ms. Sowinski and recover any monies due. Ms. Sowinski never provided client A with a complete accounting or delivered the funds, totaling at least $62,010.14, which client A was entitled to receive. On June 12, 2006, Ms. Sowinski was charged with first degree theft (major economic offense) under RCW 9A.56.030(1)(a), based on Ms. Sowinskiâ€™s theft of client Aâ€™s funds. Ms. Sowinski entered an Alford plea to the charge and, on March 30, 2007, was sentenced to 12 months and one day with credit for time served. In April 2007, Ms. Sowinski was ordered to pay $67,000 in restitution to client A.Matter No. 2: In early 2005, client B hired Ms. Sowinski to represent her in the sale of her home and an adjoining lot. A few days before closing, Ms. Sowinski had her assistant take papers to client Bâ€™s home for her signature, one of which was a document authorizing the closing agent to wire the proceeds from the sale of the property to Ms. Sowinskiâ€™s trust account. Client B refused to sign the document. The following day, Ms. Sowinski went to client Bâ€™s home. She advised client B that the sale proceeds should be deposited into her trust account because she would assist client B in settling her outstanding debts, including $21,000 owed to credit-card companies, by negotiating lower payoffs and remitting the funds to client Bâ€™s creditors. Ms. Sowinski also warned that, if client B deposited the sale proceeds into her personal account, she risked having creditors attach her account. Based on Ms. Sowinskiâ€™s advice, client B agreed to have the sale proceeds deposited into Ms. Sowinskiâ€™s trust account. On June 1, 2005, the sale of client Bâ€™s property closed. The sale proceeds of $357,101.12 were wired to Ms. Sowinskiâ€™s trust account. On June 1, 2005, Ms. Sowinski disbursed $10,000 to herself for legal fees. She did not notify client B that she intended to disburse the $10,000. As of June 1, 2005, Ms. Sowinski had sent client B only one billing statement setting forth an unpaid balance of $7,442.50. Ms. Sowinski did not issue any billing statements to client B after that statement. Between June 17, 2005, and July 13, 2005, Ms. Sowinski disbursed additional sums of $5,000 and $916.50 to herself.  Ms. Sowinski knew that she had not earned these additional fees, had not billed client B for the fees, and was not entitled to the funds. On June 3, 2005, client B e-mailed to Ms. Sowinski a list of five friends and family members to whom she owed money and asked her to pay these individuals as soon as possible. Between June 29, 2005, and July 6, 2005, Ms. Sowinski disbursed $10,925 to four individuals on the list. She failed to pay the fifth person, who was owed $500. In August 2005, client B paid the fifth person $500 from her personal account. In June 2005, Ms. Sowinski disbursed $8,250 to the escrow company for closing costs related to the sale of client Bâ€™s property. In October 2005, Ms. Sowinski disbursed $9,000 to satisfy client Bâ€™s credit-card debt to a bank. Ms. Sowinski did not negotiate a payoff of client Bâ€™s department-store debt, nor did she disburse any funds to pay the debt. Client B settled the department-store matter herself and paid the debt from her personal account. In December 2005, client B received a notice from a collection agency requesting payment of another department-store credit-card debt. Client B forwarded the notice to Ms. Sowinski. In January 2006, client B received another notice from a collection agency requesting payment of the same department-store credit-card debt. The collection agency offered to settle her debt of $8,866.94 for $3,990.12 if client B made payment within 10 days. Client B forwarded the notice to Ms. Sowinski and asked her to pay the debt. Ms. Sowinski falsely told client B that she had paid the department-store credit-card debt in October 2005. In May 2006, client B ordered her credit report and learned that Ms. Sowinski never paid the department-store credit-card debt. Between June 9, 2005, and March 27, 2006, Ms. Sowinski disbursed $80,000 to client B. In January 2006, client B asked Ms. Sowinski to transfer all remaining funds from her trust account to client Bâ€™s personal account. Ms. Sowinski agreed, but did not transfer the funds. Over the ensuing months, client B called, wrote, and e-mailed Ms. Sowinski requesting delivery of her funds. Ms. Sowinski falsely assured client B that the funds were in her trust account and that she would deliver them to her. Ms. Sowinski did not deliver any additional funds to client B. She should have maintained $248,926.12 of client Bâ€™s funds in her trust account, but did not. During the period June 2005 to March 2006, Ms. Sowinski issued checks totaling $212,868 to herself or her law firm. During the same period, Ms. Sowinski disbursed an additional $29,345 by counter withdrawal. She used client Bâ€™s $248,926.12 for her personal benefit and never provided client B with a complete accounting. Ms. Sowinski was charged with first-degree theft (major economic offense) under RCW 9A56.030, based on her theft of client Bâ€™s funds. On February 28, 2007, Ms. Sowinski entered a guilty plea. She was sentenced to 12 months and one day with credit for time served and ordered to pay $258,000 in restitution to client B.Matter No. 3: In August 2001, an individual (client C) underwent a total knee replacement. Subsequently, client C developed a serious infection, which resulted in amputation. Client C retained a law firm (Law Firm) to review her claims against the doctor(s) and hospital. On August 26, 2004, Law Firm filed a medical malpractice lawsuit on client Câ€™s behalf to prevent the statute of limitations from running. In October 2004, Law Firm advised client C that the firm did not believe there was a basis for pursuing the lawsuit. Facing a deadline to serve the lawsuit within 90 days after it was filed, client C hired Ms. Sowinski to take over her case. On November 1, 2004, client C and Ms. Sowinski signed a Letter of Engagement providing for a flat fee of $20,000 covering the period November 1, 2004, to November 26, 2004. The Letter of Engagement stated that the â€œscope of this agreement is limited to the comprehensive investigation regarding the feasibility of [client C] bringing forth suit for medical malpractice,â€ that Ms. Sowinski agreed â€œto investigate clientâ€™s possible and potential claims involving multiple possible defendants, including but not limited to medical providers, care facilities, hospitals, and transportation services,â€ and that â€œshould [client C] decide to file an action ... she acknowledges that another attorney/fee agreement must be entered into.â€ Based on her discussions with Ms. Sowinski, client C paid Ms. Sowinski $20,000 with the understanding that Ms. Sowinskiâ€™s plan was to develop new litigation strategies, not to repeat the work of Law Firm or to make a threshold decision about whether or not to take the case. Client C also understood that she would not have to pay more than $20,000, because Ms. Sowinski would present her case to a â€œpanelâ€ that could finance the balance of her lawsuit and that Ms. Sowinski would assist her in an unrelated matter involving two companies. Client Câ€™s case was Ms. Sowinskiâ€™s first medical malpractice case. Client C was not aware that Ms. Sowinski had never handled a medical malpractice case. In November 2004, Ms. Sowinski contacted a medical expert headhunter, ordered two volumes of medical records, provided the new medical records and client Câ€™s existing documents to an infectious-disease expert, and held telephone conferences with the  expert. Ms. Sowinski states that she did research and consulted other lawyers regarding client Câ€™s case. However, a portion of Ms. Sowinskiâ€™s work was to educate herself in an unfamiliar area of law and science. On or about November 22, 2004, Ms. Sowinski called client C and advised that, after obtaining the expertâ€™s opinion, she would not go forward with her case. On December 1, 2004, Ms. Sowinski filed a Notice of Appearance and plaintiffâ€™s Motion and (Proposed) Order to Dismiss Without Prejudice. Client Câ€™s lawsuit was dismissed. Although Ms. Sowinski advised client C that her case was â€œover,â€ client C did not clearly understand that Ms. Sowinski intended to dismiss client Câ€™s lawsuit. Ms. Sowinski did not inform her that she could have the lawsuit served to give herself an opportunity to consult another lawyer and did not do any work on client Câ€™s other, unrelated matter. In January 2005, client C discharged Ms. Sowinski, who did not refund any money to client C.Ms. Sowinskiâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer be deposited into a trust account; former RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring that a lawyer maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, first-degree theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any unjustified act of assault or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; and RPC 8.4(n), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law.Marsha A.

McIntosh (WSBA No. 12744, admitted 1982), formerly of Mount Vernon, was suspended for 90 days, effective September 22, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct involving lack of candor to a tribunal and initiating improper ex parte contact with a judge. Mary H. McIntosh is to be distinguished from Mary Ann Mcintosh of Wenatchee.In November 2004, an individual (T.D.) and his attorney (Lawyer B) brought an action in Skagit County against a trade association and its directors individually. The action, filed in Skagit County Court, was in its infancy in the spring of 2005, and little or no discovery had taken place. Ms. McIntosh had previously advised one of the trade associationâ€™s Board members (client) with regard to bringing a civil action against T.D. She had also previously been involved in a small-claim action and district court appeal involving T.D. By 2005, the relationship between Ms. McIntoshâ€™s client and T.D. had become very hostile, and T.D. bore a great deal of animus against Ms. McIntosh.Without consulting his attorney, T.D. filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the Washington Department of Licensing (WDL) for records regarding Ms. McIntoshâ€™s client and for the recent audit of the clientâ€™s business. T.D. neither called his attorney, Lawyer B, nor sought any advice or assistance from Lawyer B in the preparation of that document. On or about April 18, 2005, the WDL called Ms. McIntoshâ€™s client and indicated that, unless enjoined from doing so, they would be releasing the audit records to T.D. pursuant to his FOIA request. The client contacted Ms. McIntosh and requested that she prevent the WDL from releasing the audit records. Ms. McIntosh contacted the WDL and spoke with an investigator, who informed her that, unless an injunction was entered pursuant to RCW 42.17.330 (Court Protection of Public Records), the records would be delivered to T.D. on April 22, 2005.During his conversation with her, the client indicated to Ms. McIntosh that he and his wife were leaving for China and would be unavailable. Ms. McIntosh was also scheduled to leave her office on vacation on April 21, 2005, and be gone until May 2, 2005. Ms. McIntosh was aware that her clients were, or would soon be, out of the country and unavailable for signatures on a complaint and pleadings in support of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to block the release of the audit documents by the WDL. The client was also not available to provide the filing fee necessary to commence a separate action. Ms. McIntosh was aware that T.D.â€™s only available address of record was a post office box, making personal service on T.D. of a new summons, complaint, and other papers for a TRO very difficult. On April 19, 2005, after reviewing RCW 42.17.330, Ms. McIntosh phoned Lawyer B. Ms. McIntosh decided to seek an injunction of the WDL in the already-filed action, although the injunctive relief would be against a non-party to the lawsuit and the materials sought to be prevented from being turned over were not being sought through discovery in that action. Lawyer B knew nothing of T.D.â€™s (his own clientâ€™s) request to the WDL. During his phone conference with Ms. McIntosh, Lawyer B disclosed that he did not know how to get in touch with his client. He also informed her that T.D.â€™s FOIA request for her clientâ€™s audit records had nothing to do with the lawsuit in which they were involved as counsel for their respective clients. Lawyer B further stated that the Skagit County Court would not have jurisdiction to enter a restraining order against the WDL in the existing action, as the WDL was not a party to the causes of action which were before the court. He advised Ms. McIntosh that she should start a different lawsuit to enjoin the WDL. Lawyer B was very knowledgeable of the animosity between his client and Ms. McIntoshâ€™s client, as well as the extreme dislike his client (T.D.) had for Ms. McIntosh. Lawyer B knew he could not agree to the entry of a TRO. Ms. McIntosh nevertheless prepared a Motion/Declaration for an ex parte TRO in the existing action. In her declaration supporting her motion for a TRO, Ms. McIntosh implied that Lawyer B had agreed to the order, made misleading statements, and did not set forth the key fact that opposing counsel told her she was legally incorrect in seeking the TRO against an unrelated, unnamed party in the existing action. Ms. McIntosh, in the preamble to the TRO, also stated that Lawyer B â€œwas notified of the defendantâ€™s intention to obtain this order and expressed no objection so long as the hearing could take place after the defendantâ€™s vacation.â€ Before entering the order, Ms. McIntosh did not fax a copy to Lawyer B to obtain his consent or agreement to the entry of the order or provide him a copy of the order and related pleadings.On April 21, 2005, Ms. McIntosh went to the Skagit County courthouse at approximately 8:45 a.m. looking for a judge to sign the temporary restraining order. This was before the regular ex parte calendar. Ms. McIntosh flagged down a judge in the court administratorâ€™s office and handed him the motion and order, telling him that Lawyer B had agreed to the entry of the order. She did not tell the judge that Lawyer B not only opposed the TRO being entered in the action, but also objected to an injunction being sought in that action as the action was unrelated to the FOIA request and therefore the relief her client ultimately sought. During her ex parte contact with the judge, Ms. McIntosh also neglected to inform the judge that it was her opposing counselâ€™s opinion that the injunctive relief she was seeking could not be entered by the Superior Court of Skagit County for those very reasons. The judge signed the order temporarily enjoining the WDL from releasing the records to T.D. Ms. McIntosh returned to her office, left her staff with instructions to mail a copy of the order to Lawyer B and to fax a copy of the order to the WDL, and left for the airport to catch her flight.Upon learning of the entry of Ms. McIntoshâ€™s order, Lawyer B moved to set it aside. Eventually, an order vacating Ms. McIntoshâ€™s order nunc pro tunc was entered following a hearing on the merits of the respective motions.Ms. McIntoshâ€™s conduct violated RPC 3.3(f), requiring a lawyer, in an ex parte proceeding to inform the tribunal of all relevant facts known to the lawyer that should be disclosed to permit the tribunal to make an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse; and RPC 3.5(b), prohibiting a lawyer from communicating ex parte with such a person except as permitted by law.Francesca Dâ€™Angelo and Joanne S.

Cimino (WSBA No. 11698, admitted in 1981), of Denver, Colorado, received a reprimand, entered September 15, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court imposing reciprocal discipline in accordance with an order of the Supreme Court of the State of Colorado following approval of a stipulation. This discipline was based on conduct in two matters involving failure to act with reasonable diligence and failure to properly supervise a nonlawyer assistant. For more information, see The Colorado Lawyer (March 2007), available at www.cobar.org/tcl.Mr. Cimino's conduct violated Colorado's RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; Colorado's RPC 5.3(a), requiring the lawyer, with respect to non-lawyers employed or retained by or associated with a lawyer, to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that the person's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; and Colorado's RPC 5.3(b), requiring a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over the non-lawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the person's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer.Joanne S.

1108.html,17644,Greg Cavagnaro,,Reprimand,8/15/2008,,"Gregory P. Cavagnaro (WSBA No. 17644, admitted 1988), of Bellevue, was ordered to receive a reprimand on August 15, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court imposing reciprocal discipline in accordance with an order of the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to withdraw from representation in violation of the rules, failure to disclose material facts to the court, and failure to properly supervise a non-lawyer assistant.On May 3, 2005, clients met with Mr. Cavagnaro and his paralegal regarding filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. On that same day, Mr. Cavagnaro electronically filed on behalf of the clients a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition and schedules with the United States Bankruptcy Court. At the time they filed the petition, the clients owned an interest in a property on which they resided. The property was their principal asset. In December 2005, Mr. Cavagnaro obtained information revealing that a relative of the clients owned an interest in the property. Although the date on which Mr. Cavagnaro obtained the knowledge that the clients were actively involved in an adverse possession action is disputed, the bankruptcy petition schedules electronically filed by Mr. Cavagnaro were based on a petition and schedules the clients had previously filed in an earlier bankruptcy proceeding which had been dismissed by the court on motion of the trustee in that bankruptcy. The prior filings included information regarding an adverse possession action and the clientsâ€™ counsel in that action. The schedules filed by Mr. Cavagnaro list the adverse possession action as pending. In February 2006, Mr. Cavagnaro learned that the clients had asserted third-party claims in the adverse possession action, and that those claims survived the settlement of the adverse possession action.â€¢ Mr. Cavagnaro did not disclose to the bankruptcy court the existence, ongoing status, or settlement of an adverse possession action involving the clientsâ€™ property or of the multiple third-party claims made by the clients within the adverse possession action. â€¢ Despite receiving confirmation of settlement of the adverse possession action in February 2006, Mr. Cavagnaro did not seek or obtain the necessary bankruptcy court approvals for the clients continued participation in the adverse possession action, for the settlement of the action, and for quitclaiming part of their property to plaintiffs in the adverse possession action. â€¢ Mr. Cavagnaro did not inquire into the existence of title insurance and the representation of the clients by another law firm in the adverse possession action. Such inquiry would have led to the discovery that a title company had paid settlement proceeds of $230,000 to one of the clientsâ€™ relatives, who paid most of those proceeds to the clients soon after receipt.â€¢ Mr. Cavagnaro left his paralegal unsupervised prior to an important uncontested hearing in the clientsâ€™ bankruptcy action and failed to contact his office prior to and following the hearing. During this time, Mr. Cavagnaroâ€™s paralegal engaged in actions (including giving the clients legal advice, filing several pleadings in the bankruptcy, and negotiating with counsel for one of the clientsâ€™ unsecured creditors) without Mr. Cavagnaroâ€™s permission or knowledge.â€¢ Mr. Cavagnaro failed to obtain the clientsâ€™ original signatures on documents filed in the bankruptcy action.Mr. Cavagnaro asserts that the clients denied him permission to make disclosure regarding the adverse possession action to the bankruptcy court. The clients dispute this, but do acknowledge that they forbade Mr. Cavagnaro from speaking to their attorneys in the adverse possession action. Mr. Cavagnaroâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.15(a)(1), requiring a lawyer to withdraw from representation of a client if the representation will result in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct; former RPC 3.3(a)(2), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly failing to disclose a material fact to a tribunal when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by the client; RPC 5.3(a), requiring a lawyer who individually or together with other lawyers possesses comparable managerial authority in a law firm, to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that the non-lawyer assistantâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer.Scott G.

111.html,21690,Daniel Wilner,,Disbarment,1/30/2001,,"Daniel S. Wilner (WSBA No. 21690, admitted 1992), of Belfair, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective January 30, 2001, following a default hearing. The discipline is based upon his failing to diligently represent and adequately communicate with several clients, charging unreasonable fees, and engaging in conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law from 1995 through 1999.Matter 1: On November 23, 1994, Mr. Wilner agreed to represent a client in a fee dispute with an architect. The client paid Mr. Wilner $250 pursuant to a written fee agreement. Mr. Wilner told the client that he would write a demand letter to the architect and that the client could review the letter before Mr. Wilner sent it. On December 6, the client called Mr. Wilner because he had not received a copy of the demand letter. Mr. Wilner told the client that Mr. Wilnerâ€™s wife had a copy of the letter at home and that she would bring it to the office. On December 13, the client received a fax of the demand letter, which was dated December 8, 1994. On January 21, 1995, Mr. Wilner told the client that he was not sure whether the letter had been mailed to the architect. In January 1996, the clientâ€™s case went to arbitration, where the client attempted to introduce the demand letter. The arbitrator refused to admit the letter because the architect and his lawyer both stated that they had never received it. On February 3, the client retained new counsel and requested that Mr. Wilner return his fees. On February 14, 1996, Mr. Wilner returned the clientâ€™s $250.Matter 2: On December 16, 1994, Mr. Wilner agreed to represent a client in a claim against Mason County. The client alleged that the county had taken fill from the clientâ€™s land without adequate compensation. On February 23, 1995, the client paid Mr. Wilner $500 as required in the written fee agreement. The client was not able to contact Mr. Wilner about his case from January 1995 through March 1996. On October 24, 1997, the client terminated Mr. Wilnerâ€™s services and requested a refund. Mr. Wilner did little, if any, work on the clientâ€™s case and did not refund any of the fees.Matter 3: On October 2, 1995, Mr. Wilner agreed to represent a client in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The client paid Mr. Wilner $700 as required by the written fee agreement. Mr. Wilner did not file the clientâ€™s bankruptcy petition, and the client was not able to contact Mr. Wilner.On March 26, 1996, Mr. Wilner also agreed to represent the client in a marriage dissolution set for trial on April 2, 1996. Mr. Wilner agreed to handle the case for $2,000 if it did not go to trial and $4,000 if it went to trial. The client paid a $6,000 advance fee deposit. On March 31, the parties agreed to a settlement and the client asked Mr. Wilner to refund $4,000 of the advance fee deposit. Mr. Wilner did not refund any of the clientâ€™s payment.Matter 4: On October 2, 1995, Mr. Wilner agreed to represent two clients in a breach-of-contract claim regarding a house the clients owned. In January 1996, Mr. Wilner prepared a summons and complaint, and in August he told the clients the complaint had been filed and that the title company had contacted him about a possible settlement. In fact, the clients later discovered that as of August 1995, Mr. Wilner had not filed the complaint. Mr. Wilner did return $1,000 to the clients.Matter 5: On February 11, 1996, Mr. Wilner agreed to represent a client in a property damage dispute. The client was not able to contact Mr. Wilner between February and October 1996. Mr. Wilner did not complete any work on the clientâ€™s case. On March 12, 1997, Mr. Wilner returned the clientâ€™s documents along with four post-dated checks of $265 each as fee reimbursement plus interest. The client was able to cash the first check, the second was returned for insufficient funds, and the last two were not negotiable because the account was closed. Mr. Wilner did not replace the checks.Matter 6: On October 1, 1996, Mr. Wilner agreed to draft wills, a community property agreement, and a power of attorney for a husband and wife. The clients paid Mr. Wilner $550 as stated in the written fee agreement, believing that the power of attorney and community property agreement would be completed within two weeks. On November 18, the clients requested that Mr. Wilner return their existing will and fee. On December 2, 1996, the clients filed a small-claims-court action against Mr. Wilner. Two days prior to the scheduled court hearing, Mr. Wilner delivered the clientsâ€™ documents and money to their home.Matter 7: On November 12, 1996, Mr. Wilner agreed to represent a client in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The client paid Mr. Wilner $750 as required by the written fee agreement. Mr. Wilner filed the bankruptcy petition on February 28, 1997. He did not attend an April 22, 1997 meeting of creditors. On May 10, the client received notice that her case had been dismissed. She scheduled an appointment with Mr. Wilner, but when she arrived she was informed he was not available. On November 20, 1997, the client filed a small-claims action against Mr. Wilner for the fees she paid him and for additional charges from another lawyer. Three days prior to the small-claims hearing, Mr. Wilner paid the client $1,064.Matter 8: On January 9, 1997, Mr. Wilner agreed to represent a client in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The client paid Mr. Wilner $725 as stated in the written fee agreement.

The client paid Mr. Wilner $1,500 as an advance fee deposit. In August 1997, Mr. Wilner filed a notice of appearance in the lawsuit, even though he was not admitted to practice in California. Opposing counsel notified Mr. Wilner that California did not use notices of appearance and that the document had no effect. Mr. Wilner filed no other documents and the court entered a default order against Mr. Wilnerâ€™s client; however, Mr. Wilner did not keep the client informed of these orders. The client terminated Mr. Wilnerâ€™s services on April 6, 1998 and requested a return of the $3,200 she had paid in fees. On April 7, 1998, Mr. Wilner wrote to the client that he would return her money if he had not completed her case by April 30, 1998. Mr. Wilner took no action to vacate the default orders, did not complete the clientâ€™s case, and did not return her funds.Matter 10: On February 25, 1998, Mr. Wilner agreed to represent a client in a quiet title action. On March 5, 1998, the client paid the $1,500 nonrefundable retainer as required by the written fee agreement. Between March 1998 and September 1999, Mr. Wilner canceled several appointments with the client, failed to return the clientâ€™s phone calls, and did no work on the clientâ€™s case even though he had promised to do so. On November 3, 1999, the client terminated Mr. Wilnerâ€™s services. Mr. Wilner refunded $150 and promised to return the remaining $1,350, but had not done so at the time of the hearing.Matter 11: On September 21, 1998, Mr. Wilner agreed to represent a client in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The client paid Mr. Wilner $725. The clientâ€™s mortgage company had advised him that a bankruptcy filing would stop the foreclosure action on his home. Mr. Wilner did not file the clientâ€™s bankruptcy petition until June 4, 1999. On August 9, the mortgage company filed a motion for adequate protection, allowing it to continue with the sale of the clientâ€™s home. Mr. Wilner did not inform the client of the motion or file a response. The court granted the motion, and the mortgage company sold the clientâ€™s home on September 17, 1999.In February 1999, the clientâ€™s social security benefits were discontinued. In March 1999, he retained Mr. Wilner for $200 to represent him on this matter. In April 1999, the client paid Mr. Wilner additional fees for a will and power of attorney. Mr. Wilner did not work on any of these matters, and as of the date of the hearing had not returned the clientâ€™s money.Matter 12: On November 3, 1998, Mr. Wilner agreed to represent a client regarding wetlands and zoning matters.

Mr. Wilner filed a notice of appearance on February 23, 1999 and then failed to appear for two scheduled court appearances. The client was not able to contact Mr. Wilner between February and July 1999 and was not aware that Mr. Wilner had relocated his practice. On July 30, 1999, Mr. Wilner sent the client three $500 checks as reimbursement for the advance fee deposit. The checks were post-dated, one each week, beginning with August 6, 1999.

Mr. Wilnerâ€™s wife left a message for the clients indicating that Mr. Wilner had moved his office and apologizing for his lack of response to their calls. In August 1999, Mr. Wilner told the clients he would refund their money, but as of the date of the hearing had not done so.Mr. Wilnerâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.4, requiring lawyers to promptly respond to clientsâ€™ reasonable requests for information about the status of their cases; 1.5(a), requiring lawyersâ€™ fees to be reasonable; 1.14(a), requiring lawyers to place client funds into an interest-bearing trust account; and RLD 1.1(p), prohibiting conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law.C.

This discipline is based on conduct in a number of matters involving misuse of client funds and trust-account irregularities.Between 2005 and January 2008, Mr. Lippmann engaged in the following conduct:â€¢ Deposited $31,350 advance fees from a number of clients in different matters into his general business account and personal bank account rather than into an IOLTA account, and used substantial portions of those client fees for his own use before fully earning them; â€¢ Disbursed $1,100 from his trust account before waiting for a clientâ€™s two $550 checks to clear the banking process; â€¢ Disbursed advance fees to himself without first giving his clients reasonable notice of his intent to do so; â€¢ Deposited $5,000 of a clientâ€™s advance fees in one matter into his general business account, rather than into an IOLTA account, and used substantial portions of those advance fees for his own use before earning them; â€¢ Used $4,000 of a clientâ€™s advance fees for his own use before earning them in a second matter;â€¢ Obtained an unsecured interest-free loan of $10,000 from a second client with no due date, on terms that were neither fair nor reasonable to the client, without giving the client written notice or reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel, and without obtaining informed consent from the client;â€¢ Obtained an unsecured interest-free loan of $2,000 from a client with no written documentation memorializing the loan, on terms neither fair nor reasonable nor fully disclosed in writing to the client, without giving the client written notice or reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel and without obtaining informed consent from the client; andâ€¢ Charged and attempted to collect from a client $42,383.50 in legal fees on a contingent-fee case, after having withdrawn from the case, when the fee agreement made no provision for fees if representation terminated prior to resolution of the case.Mr. Lippmannâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses; RPC 1.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer from entering into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquiring an ownership, possessory, security, or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless the transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client, fully disclosed and transmitted in writing in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the client, the client is advised in writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel on the transaction, and the client gives informed consent, in a writing signed by the client, to the essential terms of the transaction and the lawyerâ€™s role in the transaction, including whether the lawyer is representing the client in the transaction; RPC 1.15A(b), prohibiting a lawyer from using, converting, borrowing, or pledging client or third-person property for the lawyerâ€™s own use; RPC 1.15A(c), requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients and third persons separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property, which includes depositing and holding in a trust account funds subject to this Rule and identifying, labeling, and appropriately safeguarding any property of clients or third persons other than funds; RPC 1.15(h)(3), allowing a lawyer to withdraw funds to pay client costs and to withdraw earned fees only after giving reasonable notice to the client of the intent to do so, through a billing statement or other document; RPC 1.15A(h)(7), prohibiting a lawyer from disbursing funds from a trust account until deposits have cleared the banking process and been collected, unless the lawyer and the bank have a written agreement by which the lawyer personally guarantees all disbursements from the account without recourse to the trust account; and RPC 8.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct.Leslie C.

1114.html,15578,Jeffrey Poole,,Suspension,11/1/2008,,"Jeffrey G. Poole (WSBA No. 15578, admitted 1986), of Everett, was suspended for one year, effective November 1, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. The suspension is to be followed by a two-year probationary period. For more information, see In re Disciplinary Proceeding against Poole, 193 P.3d 1064 (2008). This discipline is based on conduct involving noncooperation with Bar Association investigations and trust-account irregularities.In 2003, disciplinary action was taken against Mr. Poole concerning Mr. Poole billing clients at his current rates for work performed at a time when a lower rate was in effect. During the investigation, the Bar Associationâ€™s Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) sent a letter on July 24, 2003, requesting that Mr. Poole provide all billing statements that included similar charges. Mr. Poole produced a total of five statements in response to the request. However, after the hearing in that matter, ODC discovered nearly 100 additional 2002 billing statements that contained charges for time over six months old. The hearing officer in the proceeding giving rise to the discipline reported herein later identified â€œat leastâ€ 29 specific bills that should have been produced in response to the July 2003 request. Another prior disciplinary matter involved improper trust-account procedures. In August 2003, Mr. Poole received a reprimand and probation for this misconduct, and the probation included audits. Although he was required to cooperate with the audits, Mr. Poole failed to cooperate. In addition, during the audits, the auditor discovered some billing statements that fell within the July 2003 request in the previously mentioned disciplinary action that were not produced. The audits led to questions about a specific clientâ€™s (Client Oâ€™s) account, which was overdrawn by $540 for several months and showed unusual activity. The auditor requested Client Oâ€™s billing file. Mr. Poole refused to turn over the billing file as requested despite repeated requests by the auditor and later repeated efforts by disciplinary counsel to obtain the file. In 2004, another grievance was filed against Mr. Poole involving Mr. Pooleâ€™s refusal to turn over Client Oâ€™s billing file and the shortage in Client Oâ€™s trust account. Mr. Poole did not respond to the grievance, nor did he respond to a 10-day letter under ELC 5.3(e) requiring a response. A noncooperation deposition took place on September 15, 2004. At the deposition, Mr. Poole claimed he was not producing the file because the request was intrusive and overly burdensome. Instead, he produced eight Client O billing statements. After a petition for interim suspension was filed against Mr. Poole, he produced Volume 3 of the Client O file before he was required to appear and show cause why the petition should not be granted. The petition was withdrawn. Disciplinary counsel found additional bills in Client Oâ€™s file that were responsive to the July 24, 2003, request. Disciplinary counsel also found evidence of trust-account violations, including failure to maintain an accurate client ledger for Client O between October 2002 and September 2003, failure to keep all of Client Oâ€™s funds in trust between May 2003 and September 2003, and failure to provide accurate accounts to Client O regarding his trust-account funds between October 2002 and September 2003. Mr. Poole also knowingly disbursed funds before deposited items cleared the banking system. Although disciplinary counsel requested additional information, Mr. Poole did not respond. Disciplinary counsel issued a subpoena duces tecum commanding Mr. Poole to appear and produce responsive documents at the deposition. The deposition was canceled in February 2005 after Mr. Poole produced responsive documents.Mr. Pooleâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited into one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and no funds of the lawyer be deposited therein; RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here, ELC 5.3(e) and ELC 13.8)).

1116.html,11498,James Kovac,,Reprimand,8/8/2008,,"James W. Kovac (WSBA No. 11498, admitted 1981), of Lynnwood, received a reprimand based on a stipulation approved by a hearing officer on August 8, 2008. This discipline is based on conduct in two matters involving failure to act with reasonable diligence, failure to communicate, charging unreasonable fees, and failure to protect a clientâ€™s interests.Matter No. 1: Ms. â€œHâ€ hired Mr. Kovac in March 2004 to represent her minor son on possible charges of weapons possession. She paid Mr. Kovac $3,000, which she understood would be held until charges were filed against her son and, if charges were not filed, Mr. Kovac would refund the money. Although Mr. Kovac ordinarily used a written fee agreement in matters such as this that provided that his fees were a â€œnonrefundable retainer,â€ he did not execute a written fee agreement with Ms. H. Mr. Kovac contacted the police department and obtained copies of the police reports and other discovery. After speaking to the police officers involved, Mr. Kovac negotiated with the prosecution, resulting in no charges being filed against Ms. Hâ€™s son. Mr. Kovac did not immediately advise Ms. H or her son that charges were not filed against him regarding weapons possession. Mr. Kovac did not refund any of the $3,000 he received from Ms. H.In October 2004, Ms. Hâ€™s son was charged with a DUI offense. She contacted Mr. Kovac, who agreed to represent her son in the DUI matter for $2,500, which Ms. H paid. At that time, Mr. Kovac also informed Ms. H that no charges were ever filed against her son in the gun matter. After receiving the $2,500, Mr. Kovac communicated directly with Ms. Hâ€™s son concerning his case and court dates. Mr. Kovac did not keep Ms. H fully informed about the status of her sonâ€™s DUI matter. Following an administrative hearing to contest the suspension of the sonâ€™s driverâ€™s license resulting from being cited for DUI, notice of the sonâ€™s driverâ€™s license suspension, as well as when and how he could reinstate his driving privileges, was mailed by the Department of Licensing directly to Ms. Hâ€™s sonâ€™s home address. Mr. Kovac did not immediately inform Ms. H or her son when the license was suspended, when the suspension period ended, or that her son could pay a fine and apply for reinstatement of his license.In February 2005, Ms. Hâ€™s daughter was charged with a DUI offense. Ms. H paid an additional $2,500 to Mr. Kovac to represent her daughter on the DUI offense. Mr. Kovac communicated directly with Ms. Hâ€™s daughter concerning her case and court dates. Despite inquiries from Ms. H, Mr. Kovac did not keep Ms. H fully informed about the status of her daughterâ€™s case.In April 2005, Ms. Hâ€™s son was involved in a minor car accident and charged with driving without a license. Ms. H contacted Mr. Kovac concerning her sonâ€™s driving without a license charge. At that time, Mr. Kovac informed her of the suspension of her sonâ€™s license and of his failure to advise her that the suspension period had ended. Mr. Kovac agreed to represent her son without charge on the driving-without-a-license charge. He communicated directly with Ms. Hâ€™s son concerning his case and court dates; however, he did not keep Ms. H fully informed of the status of her sonâ€™s matter despite repeated requests from Ms. H. In July 2005, Mr. Kovac resolved the case by negotiating a plea to the reduced charge of negligent driving first-degree and Ms. Hâ€™s son was sentenced, thereby completing the case. In August 2005, Mr. Kovac notified Ms. H that he had been suspended from the practice of law for nonpayment of dues because his check for licensing had bounced. He told her that he would arrange for other attorneys to cover her daughter's and sonâ€™s cases until he was reinstated. In September 2005, Ms. Hâ€™s daughter waited in court for approximately five hours regarding a hearing to consider an agreement Mr. Kovac negotiated to continue the DUI matter, but no attorney appeared for her. Mr. Kovac arranged for a public defender (Lawyer D) to continue the hearing, and a continuance was granted. After Mr. Kovac arranged for another attorney (Lawyer E) to appear on Ms. Hâ€™s daughterâ€™s DUI case, Ms. H then hired Lawyer E, who completed her daughterâ€™s case and followed up on Ms. Hâ€™s sonâ€™s case for $1,500. In October 2005, Mr. Kovac was reinstated to the practice of law. In January 2007, Mr. Kovac agreed to refund Ms. H the agreed sum of $4,500. He paid Ms. H $975 in April 2007, and an additional $4,000 in June 2008, which accounts for interest in the delay of paying the agreed sum of $4,500.Matter No. 2: In August 2000, Mr. â€œPâ€ was charged with a DUI offense. A defense motion for deferred prosecution was granted, subject to completion of various conditions, with probation review set for September 2005. In January 2005, Mr. P engaged Mr. Kovac to represent him in a subsequent proceeding related to his original offense, paying him $1,500. Mr. Kovac opened a file on Mr. Pâ€™s matter, but misplaced the file and never followed up with Mr. P. In August 2005, Mr. Kovac was suspended from the practice of law for nonpayment of dues. Mr. Kovac believes he sent the required notices of his suspension to all clients, but it appears that Mr. P did not get the notice that Mr. Kovac had been suspended from the practice of law. In September 2005, a review hearing was set in connection with an order for probation regarding Mr. Pâ€™s DUI matter. Mr. P telephoned Mr. Kovacâ€™s office repeatedly, but Mr. Kovac did not respond to Mr. Pâ€™s calls. Mr. P hired another lawyer to complete the matter because Mr. Kovac did not respond to his telephone calls. In September 2006, Mr. Kovac sent a letter to Mr. P returning the $1,500 previously paid.Mr. Kovacâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.3, requiring that a lawyer act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable; and former RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to protect clientsâ€™ interests upon the lawyerâ€™s withdrawal from representation.Randy V.

1117.html,18024,Charles Ferguson,,Suspension,11/12/2008,,"Charles S. Ferguson (WSBA No. 18024, admitted 1988), of Seattle, was suspended for one year, effective November 12, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to act diligently, failure to communicate, failure to expedite litigation, trust-account irregularities, and failure to withdraw from representation when a condition impaired his ability to represent the client.On May 13, 2005, Mr. Ferguson entered a notice of appearance on behalf of his clients, who were named as defendants in a Lincoln County Superior Court matter. The clients paid Mr. Ferguson an advance fee of $3,000 to represent them. Mr. Ferguson deposited the funds into his business account, and then sent billing statements to the clients as the funds were earned. On June 5, 2005, the plaintiffs filed a motion for default. The plaintiffs had previously sent notice of the motion for default to Mr. Ferguson on June 3, 2005. Mr. Ferguson did not file an answer or respond to the motion for default. On June 21, 2005, an order of default was entered. On the same date, the court entered judgments in favor of the plaintiffs in the amounts of $309,867 and $261,808 plus costs. On June 24, 2005, Mr. Ferguson left a voicemail message for plaintiffâ€™s counsel acknowledging that he owed him an answer and that there was a motion for default set, and indicating that he would provide the answer by Monday. Mr. Ferguson never provided an answer and did not tell his clients about the order of default. In January 2006, the plaintiffs sent Mr. Ferguson post-judgment interrogatories. In February 2006, the plaintiffs filed a motion for an order requiring that Mr. Fergusonâ€™s clients answer the interrogatories. The interrogatories pertained to execution of the default judgment. In March 2006, Mr. Ferguson answered the interrogatories. Every time the clients received any paperwork (approximately 11 times), they faxed the documents to Mr. Ferguson. Each time the clients contacted Mr. Ferguson, he would assure the clients that he was â€œon topâ€ of everything and not to worry. This representation was false. In January 2007, Mr. Ferguson filed a motion to stay execution of the sale of his clientsâ€™ property pending the filing of a motion to overturn the default. The court denied Mr. Fergusonâ€™s motion. The clientsâ€™ property was sold by the sheriff as a foreclosure, in partial satisfaction of the judgments. Mr. Ferguson states that he had been ill, which caused his failure to file an answer or otherwise protect his clientsâ€™ property.Mr. Fergusonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; RPC 1.14(a), requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein; and RPC 1.15(a)(2), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client or, where representation has already commenced, requiring a lawyer to withdraw from representation of a client if the lawyerâ€™s physical or mental condition materially impairs his ability to represent the client.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

1118.html,21600,Darrell Marshall,,Disbarment,11/12/2008,,"Darrell W. Marshall (WSBA No. 21600, admitted 1992), of SeaTac, was disbarred, effective November 12, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline is based on conduct involving repeated violations of criminal laws, failure to act with reasonable diligence, failure to communicate, charging unreasonable fees, failure to refund unearned fees, and failure to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation.Criminal-Law-Related Conduct: From the period of June 2002 to December 2006, Mr. Marshall was repeatedly involved in criminal proceedings in various district and municipal courts. In June 2002, he was charged with driving under the influence, hit-and-run with property damage, and assault in violation of the Seattle Municipal Code. Mr. Marshall was found guilty on all three counts. The court sentenced him to a 60-day suspended sentence and placed Mr. Marshall on probation, the conditions of which required that he maintain law-abiding behavior and that he have no alcohol- or drug-related violations. Mr. Marshall was twice sentenced to serve jail time for violating these terms. In July 2003, he was charged with violations of RCW 46.61.502 (driving under the influence) and RCW 46.20.342 (driving with a suspended license). In April 2004, Mr. Marshall pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 365 days in jail with 331 days suspended, the conditions of which required that he maintain law-abiding behavior and that he have no alcohol- or drug-related violations.During the next two years, Mr. Marshall failed to comply with the probation conditions, and the court issued at least four bench warrants for failure to comply and/or appear. In October 2005, Mr. Marshall was charged with violating the Seattle Municipal Code by giving false information to a police officer who had stopped him for suspicion of possessing an open container of alcohol. The charge was later amended to obstructing an officer. Mr. Marshall pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a 24-month suspended sentence and four days in jail with credit for time served. The conditions of the suspension required that he maintain law-abiding behavior and that he have no alcohol- or drug-related violations. In April 2006, Mr. Marshall failed to appear for a review hearing, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. On April 10, 2006, the court revoked three days of the suspended sentence and sentenced him to jail, with credit for time served. In December 2005, Mr. Marshall was charged with violating the Seattle Municipal Code for theft, attempted assault, and false reporting in connection with an incident in which he attempted to shoplift three bottles of wine. Mr. Marshall pleaded guilty to false reporting, and the other charges were dismissed. The court sentenced him to a 24-month suspended sentence and 185 days in jail to run concurrent with any other holds and with credit for time served. In June 2006, Mr. Marshall was charged with violating RCW 9A.88.010 based on an incident in which he removed his clothes in a public park. Mr. Marshall represented himself in this proceeding. He failed to appear for trial on December 5, 2006, as ordered by the court on October 17, 2006. The court issued a warrant for Mr. Marshallâ€™s arrest, which is outstanding. Client-Representation Conduct: A client hired Mr. Marshall to represent him in a criminal matter and paid Mr. Marshall $800 in three separate installments. Mr. Marshall did not discuss the case with the client, did not provide an accounting of his fees, did not return telephone calls, and did not appear for the readiness hearing. The client appeared without counsel and the court appointed new counsel. Mr. Marshall did not refund the fees.Failure to Cooperate in Disciplinary Investigation: The Association opened a grievance against Mr. Marshall on September 20, 2006. Disciplinary counsel sent a letter to Mr. Marshallâ€™s address on file with the Association requesting a response to the grievance. The letter was returned as undeliverable. The Association sent a second letter on October 25, 2006, to a new address on file with the Association. This letter was not returned. Mr. Marshall did not respond to the letter. On November 28, 2006, disciplinary counsel sent a 10-day letter by certified mail, seeking a response by December 11, 2006. The letter was returned with a notation that Mr. Marshall had moved and left no forwarding address. Mr. Marshall did not respond to the grievance. The Associationâ€™s investigator attempted to make personal contact with Mr. Marshall by seeking him at several addresses on file with the Association and by contacting members of Mr. Marshallâ€™s family. Each attempted contact was unsuccessful. The Association filed a Formal Complaint and Notice to Answer on November 30, 2007. As of the date of the Formal Complaint, all efforts to locate Mr. Marshall had failed. Mr. Marshallâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter; former RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; former RPC 8.4(j), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order directing him or her to do or cease doing an act which he or she ought in good faith to do or forbear; RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here, ELC 5.3(e)) in connection with a disciplinary matter; RPC 1.16(d), requiring a lawyer, upon termination of representation, to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred.Joanne S.

1120.html,15767,James Gauthier,,Reprimand,3/17/2008,,"James A. Gauthier (WSBA No. 15767, admitted 1986), of Kent, received a reprimand by order of a hearing officer on March 17, 2008. This discipline is based on conduct involving the production of documents containing false statements and the misrepresentation of the origin of documents produced in discovery.In 2000, Mr. Gauthier represented a corporate client in a tortious interference lawsuit. The opposition made a discovery request for Mr. Gauthierâ€™s clientâ€™s board of directors meeting minutes from 1997 to 2001. Mr. Gauthierâ€™s client prepared and submitted to Mr. Gauthier meeting minutes that contained two untrue statements: that the meetings took place in Mr. Gauthierâ€™s office and that Mr. Gauthier was present at each meeting. Had Mr. Gauthier read the meeting minutes before producing them, he would have known that they contained untrue statements. Mr. Gauthier was in a rush to deliver the responses to opposing counsel and did not read the contents of the meeting minutes provided by the client. Instead, Mr. Gauthier merely attached them to his answer and had them delivered to opposing counsel. When responding to the discovery request, Mr. Gauthier certified that he had read the responses, when in fact he had not read the documents attached and included in the responses.In another lawsuit involving the same corporate client, opposing counsel served on Mr. Gauthier a discovery request for the production of his clientâ€™s bylaws and all amendments thereto. Mr. Gauthier had prepared amended bylaws for his client in 1999, but his client informed him that the original bylaws could not be found. Mr. Gauthier assisted his client in recreating the original bylaws from memory. In September 2002, Mr. Gauthier submitted the recreated bylaws to opposing counsel without disclosing that they were a recent recreation from memory and not the originals.Mr. Gauthierâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.M.

1121.html,17041,Barbara Varon,,Reprimand,8/6/2008,,"Barbara E. Varon (WSBA No. 17041, admitted 1987), of Bellevue, received a reprimand based on a stipulation approved by a hearing officer on August 6, 2008. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to obtain a clientâ€™s consent regarding limiting her representation, lack of communication, and failure to confirm a clientâ€™s termination of services prior to withdrawal of representation.In December 2004, Ms. Varon was hired by a client to represent her in a dissolution proceeding. The dissolution was contested and the client felt she needed an aggressive, experienced lawyer. Ms. Varonâ€™s telephone book advertisement stated that she was aggressive; specialized in dissolutions, both contested and uncontested; and had 19 yearsâ€™ experience. The client relied on those representations in hiring Ms. Varon.On June 14, 2005, a settlement conference took place. No settlement was reached and the case was scheduled to go to trial on August 29, 2005. Immediately after the settlement conference, Ms. Varon telephoned a friend of the client with whom Ms. Varon was authorized to communicate about the case. Ms. Varon informed the clientâ€™s friend that no settlement had been reached and the clientâ€™s case was therefore likely to go to trial. Ms. Varon told the clientâ€™s friend that she had limited dissolution trial experience and that she was going to withdraw from the case. Ms. Varon asked the clientâ€™s friend to communicate this information to the client.On or about June 15 and 16, 2005, the client telephoned Ms. Varon three times and left messages to return her calls. Ms. Varon did not return the clientâ€™s telephone calls. Based on what Ms. Varon perceived to be the hostile nature of the clientâ€™s telephone messages, Ms. Varon formed the belief that the attorney-client relationship had broken down. On or about June 20, 2005, Ms. Varon received a letter faxed from the client expressing her dissatisfaction with Ms. Varonâ€™s representation and asking for her money back. However, the letter did not specifically state that she was terminating Ms. Varonâ€™s services or ask Ms. Varon to no longer represent her. Over the course of the representation, the client had paid Ms. Varon approximately $13,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees. In response to the clientâ€™s letter, Ms. Varon faxed a letter to the client advising the client that she needed â€œan experienced trial attorneyâ€ and that she does â€œnot feel as qualified as an attorney who routinely does trials.â€ Included with the letter to the client was Ms. Varonâ€™s Notice of Intent to Withdraw, effective July 5, 2005, approximately six weeks before the trial date. Opposing counsel filed objections to Ms. Varonâ€™s withdrawal, based on the need to protect discovery that had been provided to her. In response, Ms. Varon filed a Motion and Declaration for Order Permitting Withdrawal that stated the client had discontinued her services and that Ms. Varon was withdrawing at the clientâ€™s request. On July 25, 2005, Ms. Varonâ€™s motion to withdraw was granted.Ms. Varonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.2(c), allowing a lawyer to limit the scope of her representation if the limitation is reasonable and the client consents after consultation; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; and former RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.Debra J.

This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to comply with a notice of suspension. For more information, see the California Bar Journal, Discipline (January 2009), available at http://calbar.ca.gov.Mr. Esauâ€™s conduct violated California Rules of Court, rule 9.20 (formerly rule 955), requiring that within such time as the order may prescribe after the effective date of the memberâ€™s disbarment, suspension, or resignation, the member must file with the clerk of the State Bar Court an affidavit showing that he or she has fully complied with those provisions of the order entered under this rule.Joanne S.

1126.html,13420,Bradley Behrman,,Suspension,12/24/2008,,"Bradley G. Behrman (WSBA No. 13420, admitted 1983), of Seattle, was suspended for nine months, effective December 24, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to act diligently, failure to communicate, trust-account irregularities, withdrawing funds from a trust account when the right of the lawyer to receive those funds is in dispute, and lack of cooperation in a disciplinary investigation. Conditions were imposed on reinstatement. For further information, see In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Behrman, __Wn.2d___, 197 P.3d 1177 (2008).Mr. Behrman represented a client in business dealings related to a failed business (GTL) beginning in the summer of 2000. One of the legal matters Mr. Behrman handled was the assignment of GTLâ€™s lease to a new tenant (PPL). Mr. Behrman completed most of the work associated with GTL by November 2002.In November 2002, funds from the lease assignment were disbursed, leading to a billing dispute. Mr. Behrman asked for $2,500 to be retained from the disbursement for paying his fees. The parties dispute whether Mr. Behrman stated that his actual fees were higher or that $2,500 was the final payment. The client told Mr. Behrman that she did not want to release the $2,500 to him without a complete billing statement. They agreed to put the $2,500 in a trust account and release the remaining funds. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Behrman withdrew $500 from the trust account without notifying the client or obtaining her approval. After the disbursement, Mr. Behrmanâ€™s only remaining task was to recover a debt from PPL, of which the clientâ€™s share was $2,922.31. After August 17, 2001, Mr. Behrman took no action to recover this debt, although he repeatedly promised to do so, and was informed several times that PPL appeared to be on the brink of bankruptcy. PPL eventually declared bankruptcy, making it unlikely the debt will ever be paid. Mr. Behrman acknowledges that if he had moved punctually, the debt would have almost certainly been collected. In February 2005, the client was able to exchange her interest in the PPL debt for a release from personal liability on the GTL lease. After November 2002, Mr. Behrman failed to respond to numerous calls and e-mails from the client regarding his final billing statement and her legal claim against PPL. The few times Mr. Behrman did respond to the clientâ€™s e-mails or letters, he promised to provide the documents soon, but did not follow through. On July 22, 2004, the client terminated Mr. Â¬Behrmanâ€™s representation and requested her files to be sent to her home address. Mr. Â¬Behrman never sent the client her entire file and did not submit a final billing statement until the day before his disciplinary hearing.Mr. Behrman failed to fully comply with the WSBAâ€™s investigation. Twice he failed to bring some of the documents listed in the disciplinary counselâ€™s subpoena duces tecum, and he repeatedly failed to follow through on promises to produce those documents by a later date. He finally produced some additional files and a complete billing statement shortly before his disciplinary hearing, but he never produced the entire client file.Mr. Behrmanâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.5(b), requiring a lawyer who has not regularly represented the client, or if the fee agreement is substantially different from that previously used by parties, to communicate to the client the basis or rate of the fee or factors involved in determining the charges for legal services and the lawyerâ€™s billing practices, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation; former RPC 1.14 (current RPC 1.15A), prohibiting funds deposited in a trust account from being withdrawn when the right of the lawyer or law firm to receive them is in dispute, and requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here, ELC 5.3(f)) in connection with a disciplinary matter.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

1127.html,25131,Christopher Raymond,,Disbarment,1/15/2009,,"Christopher P. Raymond (WSBA No. 25131, admitted 1995), of Everett, was disbarred, effective January 15, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. Mr. Raymond affirmatively admitted that the WSBA could prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence sufficient violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct supporting disbarment, but did not affirmatively admit all the facts and misconduct herein. This discipline is based on his conduct in two matters involving failure to act diligently and to reasonably expedite litigation, failure to communicate, trust-fund irregularities, conduct involving dishonesty, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and violations of duties during a disciplinary investigation.Matter No. 1: In 1999, Client A was involved in an automobile accident. Client A hired Lawyer D to represent him in a claim for uninsured motorist (UIM) coverage arising out of the accident. In June 2005, Client A hired Mr. Raymond to represent him in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding. Lawyer D settled the UIM claim on behalf of Client A, who received his share of the settlement proceeds in August 2005. In September 2005, Mr. Raymond filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on Client Aâ€™s behalf and claimed an exemption for the UIM settlement proceeds. In October 2005, the bankruptcy trustee filed an objection to the claimed exemption. In November 2005, the trusteeâ€™s attorney filed a supplemental objection to the claimed exemption. On December 7, 2005, the trusteeâ€™s attorney sent an e-mail message to Mr. Raymond offering to settle the exemption dispute. Mr. Raymond replied on the same date that he was leaving for a vacation and would deal with the settlement proposal when he returned on December 19, 2005. Over the next six months, the trusteeâ€™s attorney sent at least two more e-mail messages to Mr. Raymond in an attempt to settle the exemption dispute. Mr. Raymond received those e-mail messages, but did not reply to them. On June 9, 2006, the trusteeâ€™s attorney sent an e-mail to Lawyer D explaining that he had tried to resolve the exemption dispute with Mr. Raymond, but that Mr. Raymond would not reply. Lawyer D passed on that information to Client A. For the next several weeks, Lawyer D and Client A left multiple telephone messages for Mr. Raymond, who did not reply. Finally, in late July 2006, Client A was able to speak with Mr. Raymond, who told him that he would contact Lawyer D and the trusteeâ€™s attorney and that he would take action to resolve the exemption dispute. Mr. Raymond did not contact Lawyer D or the trusteeâ€™s attorney, and he did not take action to resolve the exemption dispute. In October 2006, Lawyer D and the trusteeâ€™s attorney negotiated a settlement of the exemption dispute that was subsequently approved by the bankruptcy court. Lawyer D, who is not a bankruptcy lawyer, negotiated the settlement because neither he, nor the client, nor the trusteeâ€™s attorney could elicit any action from Mr. Raymond.Client A filed a grievance against Mr. Raymond. On November 22, 2006, disciplinary counsel sent a copy of the grievance to Mr. Raymond and requested a written response by December 6, 2006, which Mr. Raymond failed to do. On December 28, 2006, disciplinary counsel sent Mr. Raymond a notice by certified mail informing him that he would be subject to discipline and liable for the costs of a deposition if he failed to provide a written response to the grievance by January 10, 2007. On January 10, 2007, Mr. Raymond sent two letters to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. One letter, dated January 10, 2007, stated: â€œContained with this letter is the response originally prepared to this grievance in December, 2006.â€ The other letter, dated December 4, 2006, was Mr. Raymondâ€™s response to the grievance. Forensic analysis revealed that both letters were created on January 9, 2007, and modified on January 10, 2007. In the response, Mr. Raymond stated that no action was taken in Client Aâ€™s bankruptcy case for several months because the bankruptcy trustee was too busy. Mr. Raymond also stated that, in the summer of 2006, he requested more information about the UIM settlement from Lawyer D, but Lawyer D did not reply and that Mr. Raymond sent Lawyer D a letter in September 2006 â€œoutlining the optionsâ€ and suggesting â€œalternative strategies for resolution.â€ At disciplinary counselâ€™s request, Mr. Raymond provided a copy of his client file, which included a letter dated September 6, 2006, addressed to Lawyer D. Mr. Raymond knew he had never sent that letter or any other letter to Lawyer D. In the letter dated September 6, 2006, Mr. Raymond stated, â€œTo date, our efforts to reach each other by phone have not been successful ...â€ and that he and Client A had agreed on â€œa strategy of waiting out the trustee.â€ Mr. Raymondâ€™s deposition was taken, during which he testified under penalty of perjury that he created the letter dated December 4, 2006, on or before December 4, 2006, which he thought he had sent to the Association at that time, and that he created the letter dated September 6, 2006, on or before September 6, 2006, which he sent the letter to Lawyer D at that time. Mr. Raymond did not admit to the conduct described in Matter No. 1, that the statements were false and misleading, or that he knew them to be false and misleading, but did admit that there was a substantial likelihood the Association would be able to prove the allegations by a clear preponderance of the evidence.Matter No. 2: In December 2004, Mr. Raymond filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on behalf of Client B. At that time, a mortgage corporation (Mortgage, Inc.) held a security interest in real property that Client B owned. The filing of the bankruptcy petition automatically stayed any action by Mortgage, Inc. to foreclose on the property. Between January and July 2006, Client B fell behind in her monthly mortgage payments to Mortgage, Inc. On July 18, 2006, Lawyer C filed a Motion for Relief from Stay on behalf of Mortgage, Inc., requesting that Mortgage, Inc. be allowed to foreclose on Client Bâ€™s property. A hearing on the motion was scheduled for August 23, 2006. When Client B received a copy of the motion, she telephoned Mr. Raymond and asked for his advice. Mr. Raymond told her to gather up enough money to become current with her mortgage payments. In July and August 2006, Client B brought Mr. Raymond three cashierâ€™s checks totaling $1,984, payable to Lawyer Câ€™s firm. Mr. Raymond told Client B that he would deliver the checks to Lawyer Câ€™s firm. Instead, Mr. Raymond endorsed the checks and deposited them into his trust account. Mr. Raymond failed to inform Client B that he did not deliver the funds to Lawyer Câ€™s firm.On August 9, 2006, Mr. Raymond told Lawyer C that he would agree to a stipulated order continuing the stay on the condition that Client B pay the full amount owed, including late charges, attorney fees, and costs. Lawyer C sent Mr. Raymond a Stipulated Order Conditioning Stay (stipulated order) that would require Client B to pay $2,237.76 by August 31, 2006. The August 23, 2006, hearing was stricken. Mr. Raymond signed the stipulated order and, on August 31, 2006, filed it. Mr. Raymond failed to inform Client B about the stipulated order or the requirement that she pay $2,237.76 by August 31, 2006. On October 12, 2006, Lawyer Câ€™s paralegal sent a letter of default to Mr. Raymond and Client B. The amount due included the $1,984 that Mr. Raymond was to have delivered Lawyer Câ€™s firm. Based on Mr. Raymondâ€™s representation, Client B believed that Mr. Raymond had delivered the three checks totaling $1,984 to Lawyer Câ€™s law firm. She requested information concerning the checks from Mr. Raymond, but he did not return her calls. She then contacted her bank and learned that the three checks had been negotiated. On October 29, 2006, Client B wrote a letter to Lawyer Câ€™s firm stating her belief that most of the amount due had already been delivered by Mr. Raymond. She further stated that she would deliver the letter and the remaining funds to Mr. Raymond on October 31, 2006. On October 31, 2006, Client B brought Mr. Raymond the letter along with three new cashierâ€™s checks totaling $419.82 payable to Mortgage, Inc. and to Lawyer Câ€™s firm. Mr. Raymond told Client B that he would deliver the letter and the three checks to Lawyer Câ€™s firm. He did not inform her that he had never delivered the three checks totaling $1,984 that she had brought to him in August 2006. By October 31, 2006, Mortgage, Inc. had not received any of the $2,237.76 that was due on August 31, 2006, under the terms of the stipulated order, and Lawyer C filed a Certificate of Noncompliance and Notice of Termination of Stay. On November 1, 2006, an Order Terminating Stay was entered. Mortgage, Inc. sent Client B a notice of default, informing her of its intent to accelerate her loan and foreclose on her property unless the entire unpaid balance, along with an additional $364.68 in late charges and $424 in delinquency-related expenses, was paid by December 3, 2006. After she received the notice of default, Client B requested information from Mr. Raymond, but he did not return her calls. Client B then contacted her bank and learned that the checks she had given to Mr. Raymond in August 2006 had been deposited at his bank, that the checks she had given to Mr. Raymond in October 2006 had never been negotiated, and that none of the funds had been delivered to Lawyer Câ€™s firm. On November 27, 2006, Client B was finally able to speak with Mr. Raymond, who told her for the first time that the $1,984 she had brought to him in August 2006 was in his trust account. Mr. Raymond also told her that the checks she had brought to him on October 31, 2006, had been picked up by his courier service for delivery to Lawyer Câ€™s firm, and he would verify that his courier service had delivered them. Mr. Raymond knew those statements were false and misleading. He gave Client B a money order in the amount to $1,984 drawn on his trust account. On November 28, 2007, Client B asked Mr. Raymond whether he had verified that his courier service had delivered the checks to Lawyer Câ€™s firm. Mr. Raymond told Client B that he would refund the $364.68 in late charges that had been assessed against her. Mr. Raymond also stated that he could get the $364.68 from his courier service due to its failure to deliver the checks on time. Mr. Raymond knew that statement was false and misleading. He wrote a check to Client B in the amount of $364.68. The check was drawn on his trust account. At that time, Client B had no funds in Mr. Raymondâ€™s lawyer trust account, since he had just refunded the $1,984 he had deposited in August 2006. Mr. Raymond had retained at least $364.68 of his own funds in his lawyer trust account together with his clientsâ€™ funds.Mr. Raymondâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.15A(c), requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients and third persons separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property; RPC 1.15A(h)(1), prohibiting funds belonging to a lawyer to be deposited or retained in a trust account, except funds to pay bank charges, funds belonging in part to a client or third person and in part or potentially to the lawyer, and funds necessary to restore appropriate balances; RPC 1.15(h)(8), prohibiting the disbursements on behalf of a client or third person from exceeding the funds of that person on deposit; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter (here ELC 5.3(e) and ELC 5.5(c)).Scott G.

The discipline is based upon his failure to deal properly with a clientâ€™s advance fee deposit.On July 2, 1996, Mr. Esau agreed to represent a client in a dissolution of marriage action. The written fee agreement required that the client pay a $1,700 advance fee deposit that Mr. Esau would apply against fees and costs as they were incurred. Mr. Esau deposited the clientâ€™s funds into his general account because he did not have a trust account. He prepared preliminary pleadings for the client and then explained that he would be on vacation for the next three to four weeks and would not be able to do further work until he returned. The client was not willing to wait and discharged Mr. Esau, requesting a refund of the remainder of his $1,700. Mr. Esau did not respond to the clientâ€™s letter. The client wrote to Mr. Esau two more times; Mr. Esau did not respond. On January 23, 1997, the client obtained an uncontested King County District Court judgment against Mr. Esau. Mr. Esau satisfied this judgment on March 5, 1997. Mr. Esau opened a trust account in 1998.Mr. Esauâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.14, requiring lawyers to deposit advance fee payments into trust accounts, provide clients with accountings when requested and timely refund unearned advance fees upon discharge.Marsha Matsumoto represented the Bar Association.

115.html,22465,Donna Light,,Reprimand,1/1/1997,,"Bellevue lawyer Donna Jean Light (WSBA No. 22465, admitted 1993) has been ordered to receive two reprimands pursuant to a stipulation for discipline, approved January 1997. The discipline is based upon her mishandling of client funds in two matters.Light met lawyer ""X"" when she was in law school. At that time he worked at a large Seattle law firm. Unbeknownst to Light, X transferred to inactive status in April 1991, and in May 1992, was suspended from the practice of law in Washington for failure to pay bar dues. X told Light he was ""retired.""In September 1993, a friend contacted X for advice on settling his deceased father's estate. X told the friend he was ""retired"" and referred him to Light. He told the friend that because Light was inexperienced, he would supervise her work. The friend, who was named as the personal representative in his father's will, retained Light as attorney for the estate. The major asset in the estate was a house. The will left all the property in the estate to the personal representative and his sister. During the pendency of the probate, X periodically consulted with the personal representative and gave him legal advice. In July 1994, the father's house was sold. Light and the personal representative met at the escrow company and Light was given a check for $47,167. Light met with X later that day in his office. He made a telephone call that appeared to Light to be to the personal representative. It appeared to Light from what X said during and immediately following this call that X had obtained permission from the personal representative to invest the proceeds from the sale of the house. X told Light that the sister's interests would be protected and that the personal representative had the authority to authorize the investment. Acting on X's direction, Light deposited the check in her IOLTA trust account and paid out all the money either directly to X or to third parties on X's behalf. X did not invest any of the money on the estate's behalf, nor did he repay any of it. Disciplinary proceedings against X have been deterred pending the resolution of criminal charges against him.Light stipulated that by giving X funds belonging to the estate without consulting directly with the personal representative, she violated RPC 1.4 (communication), 1.14(b)(3) (duty to render appropriate accounts to client) and 1.1 (competence).The second reprimand stemmed from Light's conduct in a second case involving X. A couple contacted X to obtain representation in the purchase of a home. X told the couple that he was working with Light. X reviewed the proposed purchase and sale agreement and at his suggestion, Light was listed as the escrow agent in the agreement. Light then picked up a check for $5,000, the amount of the earnest money deposit, from the wife. The check was made payable to Light. Light did not know at that time that she was listed as the escrow agent. She told the wife she would be delivering the funds to X. At X's instruction. Light cashed the check and gave X the entire $5,000 in cash. Light believed X would place the funds in an interest-bearing escrow account, but he instead converted the funds. Light stipulated that by giving X the $5,000 without determining either his entitlement to the funds or whether she had a fiduciary duty to the purchasers, she violated RPC 1.14(a) (preserving client property), made applicable to real estate escrow funds through RPC 1.14(d).The two reprimands were based on several mitigating factors, some details of which were not made part of the public record. Light also agreed to make restitution in both cases.Respondent represented herself. The Bar Association was represented by disciplinary counsel Anne I.

This discipline is based on Mr. Seagoâ€™s failure to diligently represent and keep accurate trust account records for one client, and failure to diligently represent another client.Matter 1: In July 1995, Mr. Seago agreed to represent a client in a dissolution action. The written fee agreement provided for an hourly fee. The client signed a written settlement agreement with the opposing party and wanted to finalize the dissolution as quickly as possible. The settlement agreement included a $24,500 payment to Mr. Seagoâ€™s client; $10,000 of this amount was to come from a second mortgage on the home. The clientâ€™s ex-husband was not able to obtain the second mortgage and did not pay the agreed $10,000. Without consulting his client, Mr. Seago agreed to changes in the already signed settlement agreement. The changes included omitting the $24,500 judgment from the judgment summary, although retaining the obligation to pay that amount, and obligating his client to pay the shipping costs for her personal property.In May 1997, Mr. Seago received a $14,314 check in partial payment of the clientâ€™s settlement. After depositing this check into his trust account, Mr. Seago disbursed $4,020 to himself for fees and costs and $10,294 to his client. Although Mr. Seagoâ€™s trust account records were not complete, the parties agreed that he failed to credit the client with $1,005 in payments she made. Mr. Seago did not respond to the clientâ€™s inquiries regarding this disbursement.Matter 2: In 1995, Mr. Seago represented a client in a criminal matter. The client pleaded guilty on three felony counts and was sentenced to 67-89 months to be served concurrently with another charge. Another lawyer (lawyer B) represented the client on the other charge.In January 1997, the client attempted unsuccessfully to contact Mr. Seago because the client believed that his sentence had been calculated incorrectly. The client contacted lawyer B, who then wrote to Mr. Seago indicating that the clientâ€™s offender score may have been incorrect. Mr. Seago did contact the client, but did not advise the client what action to take, or take any steps himself to change the sentence. Lawyer B then filed a motion requesting that the court correct the sentence. Although lawyer Bâ€™s motion requested that Mr. Seago appear at the hearing, as he remained attorney of record, he did not appear. The court reduced the clientâ€™s time served by 13 months.Mr. Seagoâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their cases; RPC 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; and RPC 1.14(b), requiring lawyers to maintain complete records of client funds and property, and to promptly pay the funds to the client upon request.Christine Gray represented the Bar Association.

Guillen (WSBA No. 22872, admitted 1993), of Seattle, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court approving a stipulation, effective August 30, 2001. The discipline is based upon her misuse of client funds between 1997 and 1999.In 1997, Ms. Guillen settled a clientâ€™s personal-injury case for $72,000. The client received $50,000 from the settlement and asked Ms. Guillen to hold the funds in trust for her. In October 1997, Ms. Guillen deposited the clientâ€™s funds in a trust account. Between November 1997 and October 1998, Ms. Guillen improperly withdrew the clientâ€™s funds from the trust account to pay her own business and personal expenses.By October 31, 1998, the trust account balance was $85.42, with no funds paid to the client or the clientâ€™s previous lawyer. During this time period, Ms. Guillen deposited earned fees into the trust account and disbursed the funds directly to pay her personal expenses. Ms. Guillen commingled her own funds with the trust-account funds to avoid garnishment from an unpaid judgment against her. In March 1998, the clientâ€™s previous lawyer learned of the settlement and filed a $9,000 attorneyâ€™s lien. Following a May 2000 arbitration, the previous lawyer obtained a judgment against the client for $5,398.25, which the client paid.On June 4, 1998, Ms. Guillen notified the client that the clientâ€™s funds were not immediately available, but that they would earn 8.5 percent interest. In August 1999, the client notified Ms. Guillen that she wanted her funds disbursed to fund a real estate purchase. At this time, there were no funds remaining in the trust account.In January 2000, Ms. Guillen arranged for $50,000 to be deposited into the clientâ€™s bank account. Ms. Guillen has agreed to pay the client interest on her money, to reimburse her for the fees the client paid her previous lawyer, and has made monthly payments to the client.Ms. Guillenâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.14, requiring lawyers to preserve the identity of client funds, prohibiting commingling lawyersâ€™ funds with client funds, and requiring that substantial client funds be placed in an interest-bearing account with interest accruing to the client; and 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.Randy Beitel represented the Bar Association.

119.html,23074,Valentino Panizzut,,Disbarment,6/20/2001,,"Valentino J. Panizzut (WSBA No. 23074, admitted 1993), of North Carolina, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective June 20, 2001, following a stipulation. The discipline is based upon dishonest conduct, failing to properly preserve client funds, and charging an excessive fee in 1995 through 1998.Matter 1: In 1995, Mr. Panizzut agreed to work for a law firm. His compensation was based on a percentage of the fees from the cases assigned to him, with a larger percentage if he brought the case into the office. The firm policy required Mr. Panizzut to advise his employer of client matters he opened, so that a client number and ledger could be prepared. Mr. Panizzut was required to deposit all client funds into the firm trust account.In March 1999, the employer terminated Mr. Panizzut and reviewed his client files. During this review, the employer discovered at least 17 client files in which Mr. Panizzut had kept fees for himself, while the clients believed that the money would be applied to their fee obligation to the firm. Mr. Panizzut admitted keeping some of the fees, but disputed others, and returned $9,004.82 to the firm.Matter 2: In 1996, Mr. Panizzut agreed to represent a client in a Labor and Industries (L&I) claim. In October 1997, L&I awarded the client $22,725.47. L&I mailed two checks totaling $6,156.88 to Mr. Panizzut in October and November 1997. The checks were made out to the client and Mr. Panizzut. Mr. Panizzut signed both his and the clientâ€™s name and deposited the checks into a separate trust account he established. He did not inform the client that he had received the funds and retained them as his fee. This amount is higher than the statutorily allowed fee in these cases.In December 1997, Mr. Panizzut sent the client $1,011.86 he received from L&I. In August 1998, Mr. Panizzut sent a letter to L&I withdrawing an appeal, requesting a lump-sum payment, and changing the mailing address to his own address. On September 23, 1998, Mr. Panizzut deposited the $15,556.73 lump-sum payment into his trust account. When the client called to ask about her funds, Mr. Panizzut did not tell her he had received the payment. Instead, he offered to loan her money. In March 1999, the client contacted L&I and found out about the payment. She contacted the employer, who confronted and terminated Mr. Panizzut. In October 1999, the court set reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees in the case at $0.00. The employer notified Mr. Panizzut of this finding in December 1999.Matter 3: In 1996, Mr. Panizzut agreed to represent a client in an L&I matter. In 1997, he represented the same client in a criminal matter. In October 1998, the client signed a power of attorney, so that Mr. Panizzut could handle some of his affairs while he was incarcerated. Mr. Panizzut arranged for the clientâ€™s pension checks to be deposited into Mr. Panizzutâ€™s trust account; the pension fund directly deposited $1,532 into this trust account. Mr. Panizzut removed $766 without the clientâ€™s permission. The pension fund learned that Mr. Panizzut had left the area and reversed the last two monthly deposits. Mr. Panizzut also opened checking and savings accounts in the clientâ€™s name. Mr. Panizzut transferred $1,108 from the clientâ€™s savings account to his personal checking account without authorization. The source of this money was not established.Mr. Panizzutâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 8.4(c), prohibiting dishonest conduct; 1.14(a), requiring lawyers to preserve clientsâ€™ funds and to pay these funds promptly upon request; and 1.5(a), requiring lawyersâ€™ fees to be reasonable.Joanne Abelson represented the Bar Association.

Markham (WSBA No. 11388, admitted 1980), of Seattle, has been suspended for one year, following a hearing, by order of the Supreme Court dated February 29, 2000. The discipline is based upon his felony conviction of attempting to evade income taxes and subsequent probation violations.On May 9, 1997, Mr. Markham pleaded guilty to one count of attempting to evade income taxes, a felony. On July 25, 1997, the Court sentenced Mr. Markham to three yearsâ€™ probation with conditions, including mandatory drug testing. On September 9, 1997, the probation officer alleged that Mr. Markham violated his probation by using heroin. The Court adopted an agreed probation modification requiring Mr. Markham to reside at a community corrections center for up to 120 days. On December 23, 1997, the probation officer alleged that Mr. Markham had again violated his probation by using heroin and being terminated by the community corrections center. The Court revoked Mr. Markhamâ€™s probation and sentenced him to four monthsâ€™ incarceration followed by two years of supervised release. On May 29, 1998, Mr. Markham was placed on home confinement with electronic monitoring, after admitting that he traveled outside the district without approval of his probation officer. On August 19, 1998, Mr. Markham admitted to consuming heroin on six dates in June 1998, failing to submit to required drug testing in June 1998, and being arrested on July 9, 1998 for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol and possessing narcotics and narcotic paraphernalia. As a result of these violations, the Court revoked Mr. Markhamâ€™s supervised release and sentenced him to 12 months and one day of imprisonment at the SeaTac Federal Detention Center. Mr. Markham completed his sentence and has been released.Mr. Markhamâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4 (b), prohibiting committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; 8.4 (c), prohibiting engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; RLD 1.1(c), subjecting a lawyer to disciplinary sanctions for violating his or her duties as a lawyer; and RLD 1.1(p), subjecting a lawyer to disciplinary sanctions for conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice.Leslie Allen represented the Bar Association.

The discipline is based upon his failure to competently represent one client and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in another matter.Matter 1: Mr. Zhu represented a Chinese citizen in an immigration matter. The client was in the United States under a student classification and wanted to obtain residency status, to look for full-time employment. Mr. Zhu advised his client that working full-time would not jeopardize his student status. Based on this advice, the client quit school and accepted a full-time job. Immigration law does not permit students to work full-time.Mr. Zhu filed a petition with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for the client to be granted classification as a temporary worker in a specialty occupation. The INS notified Mr. Zhu that the petition was incomplete and that the required additional documentation must pre-date the petition. Although the INS suggested that Mr. Zhu file a new petition, he submitted the additional documentation without filing a new petition. The INS denied the petition.Mr. Zhuâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to possess the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation necessary to competently represent a client.Matter 2: Mr. Zhu assisted a Chinese citizen in his proceeding to obtain permanent resident status in Canada. The client also retained a Canadian lawyer. Mr. Zhu prepared an employment certificate to be signed by the clientâ€™s former employer in China. Mr. Zhu signed the employment certificate himself, based on the clientâ€™s representation that the former employer had authorized his name to be signed on the certificate. Mr. Zhu did not indicate on the certificate that he had signed the employerâ€™s name. Although Mr. Zhu asked the client to request that the employer verify the signature directly with Mr. Zhu, this did not happen. Mr. Zhu submitted the certificate to the Canadian lawyer without telling him that it was not the employerâ€™s signature.Mr. Zhuâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.Randy Beitel represented the Bar Association.

The discipline is based upon her knowingly making a false statement of material fact to a third party.In 1996, the Pierce County Superior Court appointed Ms. Elsey to serve as guardian ad litem (GAL) for a child. The child lived with the mother in Spokane, and the father lived in Tacoma. In November 1996, an expert determined that the mother suffered from Munchausenâ€™s Syndrome by Proxy (MSBP), a disease in which the caregiver feigns or produces illness in the child. The expert also believed that the mother might flee when confronted with the diagnosis. Ms. Elsey notified the fatherâ€™s attorney of her intention to bring a motion seeking to transfer primary residential placement to the father. Ms. Elsey did not notify the mother because of the fear that she would flee with the child. Ms. Elsey set the motion for November 12, 1996.On October 31, 1996, a Spokane attorney filed a notice of appearance on the motherâ€™s behalf. He did not mail this notice to Ms. Elsey until November 6, 1996. On November 5, the motherâ€™s lawyer left phone messages for both Ms. Elsey and the fatherâ€™s attorney. Although the content of the message was disputed, both Ms. Elsey and the fatherâ€™s attorney thought that the motherâ€™s attorney was still considering whether to actually appear in the case. Ms. Elsey received the motherâ€™s lawyerâ€™s notice of appearance on Saturday, November 10, 1996. She opened the envelope and date-stamped the cover letter, but did not read the contents. It was Veteranâ€™s Day weekend and Ms. Elsey planned on reviewing her mail after the weekend. Ms. Elsey and the fatherâ€™s attorney appeared in court on Tuesday, November 12, 1996, and the commissioner signed an order transferring primary residential placement to the father.The pleadings and orders state that the mother was pro se. The fatherâ€™s counsel informed the court that a lawyer was considering representing the mother, but had not received a notice of appearance. The father flew to Spokane and obtained custody of the child. By the end of the case, MSBP was no longer an issue, and primary residential placement was returned to the mother. The hearing officer found that although Ms. Elsey may not have known that the mother was represented, it was negligent for her to have received and date-stamped the notice without reading the contents prior to the hearing.Ms. Elseyâ€™s conduct negligently violated RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in misrepresentations.John L.

This discipline is based on her changing the wording in declarations after they were signed, without discussing the changes with the witnesses.In 1997, Ms. Beckford represented a father in a modification of his parenting plan, filing several declarations in support of her clientâ€™s motion. Ms. Beckfordâ€™s client obtained written statements from witnesses, and she drafted formal declarations based on these statements. In drafting, Ms. Beckford changed the wording and meaning of the witnessesâ€™ statements. One witness stated: ""in the past I have seen [the mother] drink in the tavern and then go outside to the parking lot to take straight shot pulls off bottles of hard alcohol. She comes in to gamble frequently.â€¦""The declaration Ms. Beckford drafted for the witness stated: ""I believe that [the mother] has a serious alcohol problem"" and ""I believe that [the mother] is an alcoholic and compulsive gambler."" Ms. Beckford then gave the declarations back to her client, who obtained the witnessesâ€™ signatures. No one from Ms. Beckfordâ€™s office contacted the witnesses or discussed the changes made in the statements with them.

124.html,2382,Will Knedlik,,Disbarment,1/21/2000,,"Will Knedlik (WSBA No. 2382, admitted 1974), of Kirkland, has been disbarred following a hearing, by order of the Supreme Court, effective January 21, 2000. The discipline is based upon his bringing several frivolous claims, contacting represented parties directly, using litigation to embarrass, delay or burden third parties, and failing to diligently represent a client. For a more complete description of this matter, please read the Hearing Officerâ€™s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.Matter 1: On August 26, 1993 and August 30, 1993, Mr. Knedlik sent letters directly to two officers of the Together Development Corporation (TDC). These letters threatened to shut down TDCâ€™s Canadian and UK operations if Mr. Knedlik did not receive payment for his clientâ€™s alleged copyright infringement. Mr. Knedlik knew TDC was represented by counsel, because he had been previously involved in litigation with TDC and had talked to counsel about copyright issues. In September 1993,TDC obtained an injunction prohibiting Mr. Knedlik from contacting any TDC officers or franchisees except through counsel. Mr. Knedlik disregarded the injunction. His conduct in contacting the officers of TDC Corporation directly, when he knew they were represented by counsel, violated RPC 4.2.TDC was a corporation selling franchised dating services. During 1993, Mr. Knedlik filed two lawsuits against TDC on behalf of two franchisees. Mr. Knedlik filed both of these suits after one franchisee told Mr. Knedlik that he felt responsible for the other franchiseeâ€™s problems, because he had talked to her before she signed the contract. Any discussion with the franchisees about potential conflicts of interest occurred only after Mr. Knedlik was disqualified by the Court.Mr. Knedlik also represented a client operating a dating service business competing with TDC. The competitor claimed TDC had stolen its system for screening applicants. Because the TDC franchisees were the ones using the screening system, the competitorâ€™s claims were also against the TDC franchisees. Mr. Knedlik formed four Washington non-profit corporations and used these to file the competitorâ€™s and one franchiseeâ€™s claims against TDC. Mr. Knedlik did not discuss the conflicts between the competitor and the franchisees with his clients. Mr. Knedlik also started his own lawsuit against TDC, alleging that they had tortiously interfered with his ability to represent his clients. By the end of 1993, Mr. Knedlik was involved in four Federal District Court cases against TDC.In 1994, TDC requested, and the Court granted, a motion disqualifying Mr. Knedlik from continuing to be involved in any of these cases except his own, based on the conflicts of interest. Mr. Knedlik moved for reconsideration of this order, claiming that the for-profit corporations had purchased all of the claims against TDC. The Court stated: ""the agreement demonstrates how Knedlikâ€™s own interests in (1) being able to represent [the corporation], and (2) bolstering his potential contingency fee by the assignment of [the two franchisees] claims to [the corporation], clearly are in conflict with those of [the two franchisees], who as a result of the assignment no longer have any legal claims against TDC."" Eventually, the cases against TDC were dismissed, with judgments entered against one of the franchisees and the for-profit corporations. Mr. Knedlik drafted pro se appeals of the dismissals, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed them. Mr. Knedlikâ€™s conduct in representing many parties involving multiple conflicts of interest without obtaining the clientsâ€™ written consent violated RPC 1.7.After TDC moved for Mr. Knedlikâ€™s disqualification, but before the court entered the order, Mr. Knedlik signed at least 14 additional complaints against TDC and filed two complicated motions in the ongoing litigation. TDC filed a motion to stay the proceedings pending determination of the disqualification motion. During the hearing on the motion to disqualify, Mr. Knedlik told the judge that he had approximately 40 additional complaints to file. By this time, Mr. Knedlik had commenced 22 lawsuits against TDC or related entities in state court in Washington. Many of these suits named individual officers, employees, and lawyers who represented TDC and employees of companies that did business with TDC. One complaint was 300 pages long and was resolved when TDC told the Court that the case had previously been removed to, and dismissed by, the federal court.In May 1994, the Court prohibited Mr. Knedlik from filing any additional actions against TDC without leave of court. Mr. Knedlik continued to sign lawsuits, naming the officers and other TDC entities, without naming TDC directly. In October 1994, the Court issued a fifth injunction against Mr. Knedlik and recommended that he be found in civil contempt for continuing to have direct contact with TDC franchisees after several injunctions. In April 1995, the federal court imposed FRCP 11 sanctions of $10,297.08 on Mr. Knedlik, based on filing unwarranted and unsupported motions. In this same month, the Court held Mr. Knedlik in contempt for commencing litigation against TDC without using its name, and later imposed a $ 9,245.55 civil contempt award and $69,881.02 in attorneyâ€™s fees against Mr. Knedlik personally. The contempt award has not been paid.The Court also entered a permanent injunction against Mr. Knedlik to prevent harassment of TDC. Mr. Knedlikâ€™s conduct in continuing to sign lawsuits against TDC and file complicated meritless motions in the ongoing TDC cases while the motion to disqualify him was pending, and his actions resulting in FRCP 11 sanctions and a contempt of court citation, violated RPC 3.1, by bringing proceedings and controverting issues with no basis for doing so; and RPC 4.4, using means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay or burden third persons.Mr. Knedlikâ€™s conduct in commencing litigation against TDC officers and related entities, without naming TDC directly while under court order not to commence any new cases without leave of court, violated RPC 3.5(c), prohibiting conduct intended to disrupt a tribunal; and RPC 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.On May 16, 1994, Mr. Knedlik notified TDC by letter that he intended to attend the national TDC franchisee meeting. The Court entered an order enjoining Mr. Knedlik from attending the meeting. Later, Mr. Knedlik did appear, unannounced, at a different TDC franchisee meeting in Virginia. While in Virginia for the meeting, Mr. Knedlik swore out a criminal complaint against an officer of TDC, alleging that the officer assaulted him and broke a front tooth out of his mouth. The TDC officer was arrested and the case set for trial. Mr. Knedlik did not appear for trial. Later, Mr. Knedlik testified that he broke his tooth playing tennis and that someone prevented the TDC officer from hitting him. Mr. Knedlikâ€™s conduct in appearing at the national TDC meeting and swearing out a criminal complaint and then not appearing for trial violated RPC 4.4.Matter 2: Mr. Knedlik represented a ballet teacher, his ballet school and related nonprofit performing dance group. An adult ballet student loaned the teacher money for the business. In September 1995, the teacher assaulted the adult student, who filed a criminal complaint. Mr. Knedlik contacted the adult student at her new employer, explained he was sorry about what happened, and said he wanted to help her get her money back from the teacher. Later, Mr. Knedlik sent a ""Memorandum of Understanding"" to the adult student at her workplace. The student rejected the memorandum because it contained the same terms as the promissory notes the teacher had previously signed. The memorandum also stated that the student would not make any adverse comment about the teacher. The student worried that this might interfere with the pending criminal matter. At Mr. Knedlikâ€™s request, the student faxed him copies of the promissory notes. Although the teacher was asked not to be involved, the parents and board members of the dance group continued fundraising, and the group performed as scheduled in Federal Way, using a new name and new choreography. Mr. Knedlik served a lawsuit naming the ballet company and dance group as plaintiff and the adult student, her employer, and other parents as defendants. Mr. Knedlik alleged that the defendants had started a ""rival ballet studio,"" and that together they constituted a ""racketeering enterprise."" The complaint had no basis in fact. Although Mr. Knedlik threatened, he never filed this lawsuit.Mr. Knedlikâ€™s conduct in bringing claims against the student, her new employer and other ballet parents, alleging that they comprised a ""racketeering enterprise,"" without any basis in fact, violated Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) 3.1, prohibiting bringing frivolous claims; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 4.4, prohibiting using means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person. Mr. Knedlikâ€™s conduct also violated APR 5, the Oath of Attorney.Matter 3: Mr. Knedlik incorporated the Waterfront Homeowners Association (WHOA). In June 1990, a retired real estate developer received a letter from WHOA containing Mr. Knedlikâ€™s name and address. The letter also contained Mr. Knedlikâ€™s legal opinion letter regarding obtaining a tax rebate. The developer sent Mr. Knedlik $600, and Mr. Knedlik sent the developer a memorandum regarding filing a petition to adjust the assessed property value. The developer filed the petition and the Board of Tax Appeals set an April 6, 1994 hearing date. On March 31, 1994, Mr. Knedlik wrote to the Board, enclosing sales documents, stating that he would be in Ohio on the hearing date, but would ""telephone the Board room in Seattle at the appointed hour."" Mr. Knedlik did not attend the hearing in person or by telephone. Although the original agreement with the developer stated that Mr. Knedlikâ€™s attendance at hearings was a discretionary act, the developer reasonably believed that Mr. Knedlik would attend, based on his letter to the Board. After this hearing date, Mr. Knedlik failed to answer the developerâ€™s calls and letters.Mr. Knedlikâ€™s conduct in failing to appear before the tax appeals board, after specifically stating that he would appear by phone, and failure to communicate with his client, violated RPC 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; and RPC 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep their clients reasonably informed of the status of their matters.Mr. Knedlikâ€™s conduct, as described in the above summary, constituted conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law as stated in RLD 1.1(p).Linda Eide and Leslie Allen represented the Bar Association.

The discipline is based upon abandonment of her practice without notifying her clients, in violation of RPCs 1.3 and 1.4.Phillips was a sole practitioner in Tacoma for approximately 11 months. On or about October 14,1995, lawyer Phillips left Tacoma and her law practice without any notice to her clients. Phillips did not arrange for other lawyers to take her clients' cases nor assist clients with imminent court dates. On October 16, 1995, Phillips' paralegal informed the Bar Association that she arrived at work to find the office empty and abandoned. On October 17, 1995, the Disciplinary Board appointed a custodian of Phillips' client files, pursuant to RLD 8.6. Between October 1995 and March 1996, seven clients filed grievances against Phillips for failure to complete the work she agreed to perform. Many of the grievances also requested that Phillips return the unused portion of the nonrefundable advance fee deposit. In March 1996, the Bar Association located Phillips. After disciplinary counsel called Phillips, she agreed to respond to the grievances and refund the unearned advanced-fee deposits. In April and May 1996, she refunded the unearned advance fee deposits.

127.html,2492,George Livesey,,Disbarment,1/13/1997,,"Bellingham lawyer George Livesey Jr. (WSBA No. 02492, admitted 1949) has been ordered disbarred effective January 13, 1997, by order of the Supreme Court. The discipline imposed was pursuant to an October 1996 Stipulation for Disbarment. Livesey's disbarment was based upon several misappropriations of client money, ranging from $21,000 to $80,000, which he had received as executor of an estate and as attorney for the beneficiary of another probate estate; his preparation of a testamentary instrument for a nonrelative, which bequeathed to him $10,000; and his $50,000 unsecured loan from a long-time client without complying with the terms of the conflict-of-interest rules. The misappropriations of estate and client funds occurred between March 1994 and October 1995.Procedural HistoryDisciplinary charges were filed against Livesey on March 18,1996. On April 11, 1996, the Supreme Court suspended Livesey pending the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings. On October 10, 1996, Livesey signed a Stipulation to Disbarment. The Stipulation provided for restitution of:1.Three payments to a probate estate: a.	$4,885 principal plus $216.23 in costs; b.	$23,725.68 principal plus $2,500 in attorney's fees, with interest; c.	$60,000 principal and $20,000 in attorney's fees plus interest; 1.	A payment of $80,122.27 principal, prejudgment interest of $4,807.32, attorney's fees of   $3,500, and costs of $210, plus interest, to the beneficiary of second probate estate. The restitution amounts were based on a November 1995 judgment and three stipulated judgments entered in Whatcom County Superior Court in March 1996 and May 1996 in a case filed by the estate for which Livesey had acted as Executor and a case filed by one of his clients, a beneficiary to another estate. Pursuant to the terms of the stipulation to disbarment, Livesey also agreed to pay to the Bar Association costs and expenses of $3,475.60. The Disciplinary Board approved the stipulation on December 4, 1996. By Supreme Court order entered January 13,1997, Livesey was disbarred and ordered to pay restitution and costs as outlined above.FactsA. Theft at First Client's FundsIn March 1994, Livesey assumed his duties as executor of an estate, and received a $21,650.81 check on behalf of the Estate. He deposited the check in his IOLTA account instead of the estate's account, and misappropriated the money. As of the date of the stipulation, there were insufficient funds in the IOLTA account to disburse the $21,650.81 to the estate. In February 1995, Livesey cashed the estate's $67,298.95 certificates of deposit in return for a cashier's check made payable to the estate. Livesey deposited the cashier's check into his IOLTA account instead of the estate's account, and misappropriated the money. The beneficiaries of the estate learned of the misappropriations in the summer of 1995, after Livesey had resigned as executor. Livesey resigned after the beneficiaries began to question: 1) his delay in creating the trust provided for in their mother's will; 2) his preparation of the will which provided him with a $10,000 bequest; 3) his payment to himself of the $10,000 bequest; and 4) his payment to himself of $14,000 in attorney's fees without court approval or notice to the beneficiaries.Livesey stipulated that the Association had sufficient evidence for a hearing officer to find that as executor of the estate, he violated RLD l.l(a) (commission of an act involving dishonesty), RPC 1.8(c) (prohibiting the preparation of a testamentary instrument which gives the lawyer a substantial bequest), and RPC 1.14 and 8.4(c) (relating to dishonesty and mishandling of client funds).B. Improper Loan from Second ClientOn September 26,1995, Livesey asked a long-time client to loan him $50,000 for four days. Prior to obtaining the loan, Livesey did not fully disclose to the client the terms of the loan, nor did he give her reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel. The client loaned him the $50,000. Livesey used the $50,000 loan to repay the Estate referenced in Section II.A., above. The next day, Livesey gave the client a promissory note evidencing a promise to repay the loan on or before October 2, 1995, with $1,000 interest. Livesey did not repay the loan by October 2, 1995. On October 3, 1995, Livesey showed the client a check for approximately $80,000, payable to one of Livesey's other clients, and told her that he would deposit that check in his account and use it to repay the $50,000 loan. The client also asked Livesey for the $10,000 which Livesey had received on her behalf in connection with the sale of real estate in August 1995. On October 11, 1995, the client filed suit for money owing. On October 12, 1995, Livesey paid the client $62,000, using a $52,000 cashier's check purchased with funds drawn on this general business account and a $10,000 general business account check.Livesey stipulated that the Association had sufficient evidence for a hearing officer to find that he violated RLD 1.1(a) (commission of an act involving dishonesty), and RPC 1.8(a)(1) and 1.8(a)(2) (improper business transaction with a client) when he obtained the loan from his client.C. Forgery of Third Clientâ€™s Check and Misuse of FundsLivesey was hired by the third client to represent her interests during the probate of her father's estate. On October 2, 1995, Livesey received an $80,122.27 check payable to the third client. drawn on her late father's estate account. He asked his client to endorse the check over to him so that he could deposit it in his IOLTA account. He said he would give her an IOLTA check for the ful1 amount as soon as the check cleared the account. On October 12, 1995, Livesey went to the bank on which the check was drawn and endorsed it payable to the order of himself, scratching out the ""for deposit only"" endorsement on the back of the check. Instead of cashing the check, the bank issued an $80,122.27 cashier's check payable to the client.On October 12, 1995, Livesey endorsed the cashier's check over to himself, signing his client's name. He deposited the check into his general business account. Livesey did not have his client's permission to endorse the cashier's check on her behalf, nor did he have the client's permission to deposit the check into his general business account. Livesey used the funds from the $80,122.27 cashier's check to pay the second client $62,000.Livesey stipulated that the Association had sufficient evidence for a hearing officer to find that his unauthorized endorsement of the $80.122.27 cashier's check, unauthorized deposit of the cashier's check into his general business account, and use of his client's monies to repay the second client $62,000 violated RLD l.l(a) (commission of an act involving dishonesty), and RPC 1.14 and 8.4(c) (relating to dishonesty and mishandling of client funds).The hearing officer was Nancy Preg of Seattle.

The discipline is based upon making false statements regarding proceedings instituted for revocation of her license to practice law, providing multiple social security numbers to employers and the Bar Association, falsely representing to an employer that she had professional liability coverage, and falsely denying that she had been previously admitted to the Bar Association under another name.On June 15, 1987, Claere Shea applied for admission to the WSBA using the name Claire Axelrad Merrit. The real Claire Axelrad Merrit was admitted to practice in another state in 1978, and has never applied for admission to the WSBA. On October 27, 1987, Claere Shea was admitted to the WSBA under the name Claire Axelrad Merrit and given the WSBA No. 17244.In March 1990, the WSBA received information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation indicating that they believed Ms. Sheaâ€™s true identity may be Patricia A. Oâ€™Shea, who had an outstanding felony arrest warrant for larceny in Massachusetts. In May 1990, the WSBA granted Ms. Sheaâ€™s request to change her name of record to Claire Oâ€™Shea. On November 17, 1990, the WSBA filed a motion with the Supreme Court to have Ms. Sheaâ€™s credentials rescinded. The Court granted the motion.On June 16, 1994, Ms. Shea submitted an application to take the bar examination and to be admitted to the WSBA. This application used the name Pat Shea, indicated that she had never practiced in Washington, and that proceedings had never been instituted against her for revocation of any license. Ms. Shea passed the winter 1995 bar exam, was admitted to the WSBA and assigned WSBA No. 24938. On February 11, 1997, Ms. Shea requested that her WSBA records be changed to reflect her name as Claere Shea.Ms. Shea responded to a newspaper advertisement for a contract lawyer. She told her potential employer that she had professional liability insurance and provided the name of the company. After the employer was not able to verify the coverage, Ms Shea admitted that she did not have liability insurance.During the investigation of this matter, Claere Shea appeared personally at the WSBA offices. Although her hair color had changed, WSBA staff members recognized her as the same person formerly known as Claire Axelrad Merrit or Claire Oâ€™Shea. Ms. Shea claimed that one of her sisters was the person who worked as the contract lawyer without liability insurance.On February 19, 1998, Ms. Shea applied for a legal assistant position in the ""D"" law firm. Her rÃ©sumÃ© contained misleading and false information about her experience and education. The D law firm hired Ms. Shea on April 22, 1998. Prior to leaving the firm without notice on October 2,1998, Ms. Shea downloaded many computer files from the firmâ€™s local area network onto a disk and then deleted the files from the network. Subsequently, the firm was able to recover the files using a computer security service. They found that some of the pleadings included a signature block for Claere P. Shea, Attorney at Law, WSBA No. 24938.Ms. Sheaâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 8.1(a), prohibiting knowingly making a false statement of material fact in connection with a bar admission application; 8.1(b), knowingly failing to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension created in the bar application process or knowingly failing to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admission authority; RPC 8.4 (b), prohibiting committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; 8.4 (c), prohibiting engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; and RPC 7.1, prohibiting making false or misleading communications about the lawyer or the lawyerâ€™s services.Timothy Leachman and Maria Regimbal represented the Bar Association.

This discipline was based on conduct involving the commission of a felony crime.On November 7, 2007, Mr. White engaged in an altercation with his then-girlfriend, Ms. P, who was also his law partner at that time. On October 8, 2008, Mr. White entered a guilty plea to the crime of unlawful imprisonment involving domestic violence (RCW 9A.40.040), a class-C felony, based on the November 7, 2007, event. Mr. Whiteâ€™s guilty plea was an Alford plea by which he agreed to allow the court to review the police records and/or statement of probable cause supplied by the prosecution. The statement of probable cause contains the following allegations: Mr. White and Ms. P got into an argument after Mr. White backed into a vehicle in a parking lot and refused to leave information on the vehicle. At the time, Mr. White was driving Ms. Pâ€™s automobile. Mr. White drove Ms. P to their law office.

The discipline is based on his acts of fraud, dishonesty and misrepresentation while attempting to arrange a world-class boxing match in 1991 and 1992.In 1991, Mr. Wheeler and a business partner operated a boxing promotion company named Wheeler and Associates (W&A). In February, W&A agreed to assist a Chinese corporation (CX) in planning a world-class boxing event in China, agreeing to act as agent for CX. Later in 1991, a disagreement regarding W&Aâ€™s compensation developed. When CX asked for the names of W&Aâ€™s directors, Mr. Wheeler provided a false response, naming two individuals who were not directors of W&A.In December 1991, CX and W&A signed a supplemental agreement providing that CX would advance $700,000 for Mr. Wheeler to sign boxer George Foreman. Mr. Wheeler did not sign Mr. Foreman, but used the money for personal and business expenses. When Mr. Wheeler suggested that the main event involve two other fighters, CX agreed, and the parties signed another agreement in March 1992. This agreement was signed in both Chinese and English. The Chinese version was four pages and did not contain any fee provisions for W&A. The English version contained five pages, the last of which included an $850,000 fee for W&A. Mr. Wheeler caused CXâ€™s president, who could not read English, to sign this last page without knowledge of the fee.In March 1992, Mr. Wheeler delivered two signed boxing services agreements to CX. These agreements purported to be signed by the agents of the two main-event fighters. In fact, Mr. Wheelerâ€™s business partner had forged the signatures at Mr. Wheelerâ€™s direction. Mr. Wheeler falsely told CX that he had advanced $1.8 million dollars of W&Aâ€™s money to secure the two main-event fighters. On April 21, CX wired $1 million to Mr. Wheelerâ€™s personal account.On May 1, 1992, Mr. Wheeler told CX, falsely, that the two main-event boxersâ€™ contracts were cancelled to avoid a $5.6 million-dollar charge, because W&A and CX had not rescheduled the boxing match. Mr. Wheeler also falsely told CX that the $2.4 million already advanced to the two fighters was forfeited as a result of the cancellation of the boxing match. On May 11, knowing that he would not be able to sign the two main-event fighters, Mr. Wheeler allowed CX to announce the fight in a press conference in China.During May, Mr. Wheeler continued to demand that CX reimburse him for the money he falsely claimed to have paid the fighters. On May 16, CX wired $600,000 to Mr. Wheelerâ€™s personal bank account and another $800,000 on May 18. On May 27, Mr. Wheeler transferred $1 million to an investment account. Mr. Wheeler continued to press CX for more money, indicating that if he did not receive $400,000 ""there will be no event.""In August 1992, Mr. Wheeler and his business partner were in Beijing, meeting with the CX representatives. Mr. Wheeler and his partner gave CX a false letter of credit, to show that they had obtained funding for the television pay-per-view contracts. Mr. Wheelerâ€™s partner drafted the letter on bank stationery, and Mr. Wheeler signed a fictitious name as bank chairman. Later, Mr. Wheeler told CX that the letter was only a sample. On the way home from Beijing, Mr. Wheeler vacationed in Europe, financing his trip mostly with money from the $3.1 million provided by CX.On August 24, Mr. Wheeler and his business partner split the remaining funds. A former employee of Mr. Wheeler and his partner contacted CX and suggested that they ask for an accounting. In response to CXâ€™s requests for cancelled checks and receipts, Mr. Wheeler produced a false report stating that $1.2 million had been advanced to each main-event fighter and that the money had been forfeited due to cancellation. Mr. Wheeler paid one fighterâ€™s manager $70,000 at most, and made no payments to the other.Mr. Wheelerâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 8.4(a), prohibiting lawyers from knowingly assisting others to violate the RPCs; 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; RLD 1.1(a), prohibiting lawyers from committing acts involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, corruption or other acts reflecting disregard for the rule of law; RLD 1.1(c) and APR 5(d), prohibiting lawyers from violating the oath or duties as a lawyer; and RLD 1.1(p), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law.Linda Eide and Anne I.

1352.html,19677,John Gissberg,,Suspension,4/30/2009,,"John G. Gissberg (WSBA No. 19677, admitted 1990), of Seattle, was suspended for nine months, effective April 30, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to adequately safeguard client property in his possession, trust-account irregularities, and non-cooperation in a Bar Association investigation.In 2005, the Bar Association investigated an overdraft on Mr. Gissberg's trust account. In that investigation, Mr. Gissberg failed to respond to two letters from the Association requesting his response. Consequently, the Association was required to take Mr. Gissberg's deposition. Following the deposition, in August 2006, disciplinary counsel sent Mr. Gissberg a letter dismissing the investigation but warning him that ""if you fail to cooperate in the future, you should expect that we will seek disciplinary sanctions against you.""On April 9, 2007, Mr. Gissberg presented two checks against his IOLTA account in excess of the funds on deposit. These items were paid, resulting in an overdraft. On April 18, 2007, the Bar Association received a notification from the bank that Mr. Gissberg's IOLTA account was overdrawn and sent him a letter requesting his response to the overdraft notice. Mr. Gissberg failed to respond. On April 30, 2007, a third check was presented against Mr. Gissberg's IOLTA account, for which there were insufficient funds on deposit. The account incurred continuous overdraft fees each day from April 9 until May 17, 2007, when Mr. Gissberg deposited money into the account. On May 23, 2007, the Bar Association sent Mr. Gissberg a certified letter requesting his response by June 5, 2007. The letter was returned to the Bar Association because Mr. Gissberg failed to claim the letter from the post office. On June 18, 2007, the Bar Association issued a subpoena duces tecum, requiring Mr. Gissberg's attendance at a deposition scheduled for July 10, 2007. The subpoena requested the production of documents. Mr. Gissberg did not appear for the deposition. On July 17, 2007, the Bar Association filed a petition for interim suspension with the Washington State Supreme Court; the Court suspended Mr. Gissberg from the practice of law on October 12, 2007. Mr. Gissberg did not file an affidavit of compliance in accordance with ELC 14.3 following his suspension. Mr. Gissberg subsequently appeared for a deposition on December 17, 2007. In 2007, Mr. Gissberg did not keep a trust-account register, did not keep a running balance of the funds in his trust account, and did not reconcile his monthly bank statements to any other document. In fact, he reviewed his bank statements only once a year. He did not keep individual client ledgers, but instead wrote the client's name on the checks deposited to, or written on, the account. Mr. Gissberg relied solely on memory to determine whose money was in the trust account. Consequently, he did not always know whose funds were in the trust account, or in what amounts. Mr. Gissberg's April 2007 overdrafts of his trust account occurred because of the deficiencies in his record-keeping. In September 2007, Mr. Gissberg represented client A in an immigration matter. Mr. Gissberg received a fee of $2,400 from client A, which he considered earned upon receipt. On September 28, 2007, Mr. Gissberg deposited $1,800 into his trust account, and $600 into his general account. He accomplished this by depositing one check into two or more accounts at the same time, commonly known as a split deposit. In 2007, Mr. Gissberg represented clients B and C. Mr. Gissberg held the funds given to him for legal services by clients B and C in his trust account. In April 2007, Mr. Gissberg removed the money from trust because he believed he had earned the fees. Mr. Gissberg did not provide clients B or C with a bill showing that he had earned the money they paid him prior to removing the money from the trust account. Mr. Gissberg's conduct violated former RPC 1.14 and current RPC 1.15A and RPC 1.15B, requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm to be deposited into one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts maintained as set for the in the rules and that no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter (here, ELC 5.3(f) and ELC 14.3).Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

1384.html,12172,Dennis Ott,,Resignation in Lieu of Disbarment,6/5/2009,,"Dennis G. Ott (WSBA No. 12172, admitted 1981), of Kelso, resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective June 5, 2009. This resignation was based on his conduct in at least nine different matters involving failure to act with reasonable diligence, failure to communicate, charging unreasonable fees, failure to protect clients' interests, making false statements, destroying documents having potential evidentiary value, violating the rules of professional conduct, engaging in criminal acts, engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and violating duties imposed by the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct.Beginning as early as 1996 and continuing into 2007, Mr. Ott engaged in the following conduct:â€¢ Mr. Ott directed his legal assistant to prepare a false declaration, and Mr. Ott drafted and filed a memorandum of law, stating that his office had never received a faxed document from opposing counsel in a support modification matter. His office had, in fact, received the faxed document.â€¢ In a second matter, Mr. Ott instructed his legal assistant to shred a fax from opposing counsel after telling counsel that he had not received the fax.â€¢ Mr. Ott billed a client for the preparation of a letter that did not exist. After the client questioned the existence of the letter and filed a grievance, Mr. Ott provided the Bar Association with a copy of a backdated letter and declaration that he directed his staff to prepare to conceal his wrongdoing.â€¢ After failing to keep several appointments with a client in a probate matter, Mr. Ott avoided talking to the client by hiding in his office or slipping out the back door and instructed his staff to lie about his availability.â€¢ In two family law matters, Mr. Ott failed to act diligently by doing no work on either matter. One of the two clients called Mr. Ott's office on several occasions, but he refused to take or return the client's phone calls.â€¢ In a claim against an estate, Mr. Ott failed to communicate to his clients that a scheduled meeting was to be a settlement conference with opposing counsel. Based on Mr. Ott's advice, the clients decided to wait for a larger settlement offer. Later, during a Bar Association investigation, Mr. Ott denied that he suggested to the clients that they wait and instead stated that it was the clients who told him to ""put things on hold."" To support his position, Mr. Ott provided the Bar Association with a letter he fabricated and backdated.â€¢ In the previous matter, Mr. Ott's failure to act diligently resulted in the dismissal of the clients' case. Mr. Ott neither informed the clients about the dismissal nor returned the phone messages left by the clients requesting case status updates. When Mr. Ott returned one of the clients' many messages, the clients requested that Mr. Ott return their client file; Mr. Ott failed to do so.â€¢ In response to a Bar Association grievance filed by the clients in the previous matter, Mr. Ott provided the Bar Association with a letter he fabricated, purportedly informing the clients that the matter would be dismissed if no further action was taken.â€¢ Mr. Ott failed to act diligently in a probate and guardianship matter involving three disabled adults. Over the course of two years, Mr. Ott failed to return the phone calls of the individual who was named in the will as the personal representative to decedent's estate and as the temporary guardian of the disabled adults.â€¢ In a probate matter, Mr. Ott did not follow the clear directives of the decedent's will in the preparation of a discretionary trust for decedent's granddaughter. â€¢ On several occasions, Mr. Ott had his legal assistants notarize documents when they did not witness the party signing the documents.Mr. Ott's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed of the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyer's fee to be reasonable; RPC 1.16(d), requiring a lawyer, upon termination of representation, to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests, such as surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled; former RPC 3.3(a), prohibiting a lawyer from making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; former RPC 3.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from unlawfully obstructing another party's access to evidence or unlawfully altering, destroying, or concealing a document or other material having potential evidentiary value; RPC 3.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from falsifying evidence; RPC 5.3(c), with respect to a non-lawyer employed or retained by or associated with a lawyer, a lawyer shall be responsible for conduct of such a person that would be a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if engaged in by a lawyer if the lawyer orders or, with the knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; RPC 8.1, prohibiting a lawyer in connection with a disciplinary matter from knowingly making a false statement of material fact, failing to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in a matter, or knowingly failing to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority; RPC 8.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects (here, by violating RCW 9A.72.040 (false swearing)); RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

Eugster (WSBA No. 2003, admitted 1970), of Spokane, was suspended for 18 months, effective June 11, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. For further information, see In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Eugster, 209 P.3d 435 (2009).This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to abide by a clientâ€™s objectives, disclosing confidential information, using information related to representation to the clientâ€™s disadvantage, failure to surrender a clientâ€™s file, failure to protect a clientâ€™s interests, disobeying an obligation under the rules of a tribunal, and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.Mrs. S, an 87-year-old widow, hired Mr. Eugster in June 2004. Mrs. S had recently moved into an assisted-living facility after the death of her husband. Mr. Eugster had previously represented her only son (RS) in the early 1990s in a dissolution matter. The objective of Mrs. S in contacting Mr. Eugster was to remove RS from his position of control over her affairs and to assist her with estate planning. In 2003, before her husbandâ€™s death, Mrs. S and her husband had executed new wills drafted by another attorney. Under those wills, RS would inherit the home of Mr. and Mrs. S, and the daughter of RS would be the beneficiary of a residual trust. The wills also created a supplemental-needs trust for the surviving spouse and named RS as the trustee, with the discretion to make or withhold payments. The wills specified the trust was irrevocable and could not, absent a court order, be changed.In late 2003, dissatisfied with the wills, Mrs. S contacted Attorney B, who changed the beneficiary of a life-insurance policy from RS back to Mrs. S. RS discovered that Mrs. S had hired Attorney B and became â€œvery upset.â€ He saw his motherâ€™s consultations as a betrayal of family trust and questioned her competence. In January 2004, RS had a psychologist examine his mother for testamentary capacity. The psychologist concluded that Mrs. S had testamentary capacity.In February 2004, upon the death of Mr. S, RS became the personal representative of his estate and acted as trustee of the supplemental-needs trust for the benefit of Mrs. S. RS also assumed control over the payment of bills, because he did not believe his mother was capable of doing so. During this time, the relationship between RS and his mother continued to deteriorate. Mrs. S felt RS was manipulating her estate and denying her adequate funds so he could preserve more for himself and his daughter after her death. The relationship became even more strained as RS continued to refuse her requests for money. Mrs. S hoped removing her son from authority over her affairs would help mend their relationship. Mrs. S hired Mr. Eugster in June 2004 to â€œshort-circuitâ€ RSâ€™s control over her affairs and also to retrieve certain items of personal property from RS. Mr. Eugster had Mrs. S revise her estate-planning scheme by creating a revocable living trust. Mrs. S was named the trustee, with Mr. Eugster serving as successor trustee and RS as secondary successor trustee. To protect Mrs. S, consistent with the existing testamentary trust and consistent with her desire that RS not control her finances, Mr. Eugster was given power of attorney both generally and for health care. In July 2004, Mr. Eugster met with RS to discuss the supplemental-needs trust created by Mr. Sâ€™s will. He also consulted with Mrs. Sâ€™s financial planner and made preparations to sell the family home of Mr. and Mrs. S. As to recovering Mrs. Sâ€™s personal property, Mr. Eugster located the items she requested but assured her by letter that RS was keeping them safe. In August, Mr. Eugster wrote Mrs. S to assure her of RSâ€™s good intentions toward her and recommended RS resume control over her affairs. Mrs. S responded by seeking counsel of another attorney (Attorney C). On September 9, 2004, Attorney C wrote Mr. Eugster notifying him that Attorney C now represented Mrs. S and explicitly revoking Mr. Eugsterâ€™s power of attorney. Mr. Eugster responded by letter stating that he did not â€œbelieve that [Mrs. S] is competent. A guardianship should be established for her person and her estateâ€¦.â€ Attorney C then sent a letter to Mr. Eugster that his services as Mrs. Sâ€™s attorney were terminated and requesting that her files be forwarded to his office. In addition, the letter stated that Mrs. S â€œfully expects any and all communications with you to remain confidential and not be passed on to [RS].â€ Attorney C also asked Mr. Eugster to advise him of any changes in Mrs. Sâ€™s competence since the execution of her trust in July where witnesses testified she was of sound mind. Around the same time, Mrs. S removed Mr. Eugster as her successor trustee of her trust and named a new successor trustee (NTM Services). Under the durable power of attorney prepared by Attorney C, NTM Services was entitled to reimbursement for all costs and expenses and â€œshall be entitled to receive at least annually, without court approval, reasonable compensation for services performed on the principalâ€™s behalf.â€ On October 8, 2004, NTM Services informed RS that Mrs. S had resigned as trustee and had named NTM Services as successor. Attorney C and NTM Services also attempted to get RS, as trustee of Mr. Sâ€™s testamentary trust, to pay $2,000 per month to them for â€œone-half of her support.â€ Mr. Eugster deemed the requested payment improper under the special-needs trust. On September 27, 2004, Mr. Eugster petitioned the court to appoint a guardian for Mrs. S. He filed the guardianship action pursuant to former RPC 1.13, â€œClient Under a Disability.â€ Mr. Eugster signed his name on the line marked â€œPetitioner/Attorneyâ€ and represented that he was the current attorney for Mrs. S. RS served as the co-petitioner at the behest of Mr. Eugster, and provided some of the information for the petition. Mr. Eugster disclosed to RS his belief that Mrs. S lacked competence. RS eventually hired an attorney to represent him in the guardianship proceeding. The petition listed Mrs. Sâ€™s personal and financial information, characterized her as unable to manage her person and estate, and described her as â€œdelusional.â€ In the petition, RS was nominated to act as Mrs. Sâ€™s guardian. The petition for appointment of guardian was served on Mrs. S in the common room of her assisted-living facility, which humiliated her. Mr. Eugster filed the petition based upon his personal judgment without conducting any formal investigation into the medical or psychological state of Mrs. S. Three months before he filed the guardianship petition, Mr. Eugster had Mrs. S sign a new trust, powers of attorney, and a will that he had prepared, indicating he had no concerns about her testamentary capacity at that point. The last date that either Mr. Eugster or RS personally talked to Mrs. S was two months before filing the petition. Mr. Eugster appeared before a judge seeking appointment of a guardian on October 19, 2004. He assured the court that he had reviewed the ethical issues involved with him seeking to appoint a guardian. Mr. Eugster told the court he believed his actions were ethically viable, and the court asked Mr. Eugster to brief the issue. Mr. Eugster did not supply a brief. Instead, by letter dated October 21, 2004, Mr. Eugster purported to decline his service as successor trustee over Mrs. Sâ€™s trust and as attorney-in-fact. On October 26, 2004, the guardian ad litem (GAL) appointed to evaluate Mrs. S concluded she was not suffering from any incapacity and was capable of handling her own affairs. He noted Mrs. Sâ€™s strained relationship with and distrust of her son, RS. The GAL concluded Mrs. S did not need a guardian, but that if the court did appoint one, the guardian should not be RS. On November 17, 2004, Mr. Eugster withdrew his signature from the guardianship petition. By stipulation of the parties, the court dismissed the guardianship petition on February 1, 2005. Mrs. S paid $13,500 to defend herself in the guardianship action.Mr. Eugsterâ€™s actions violated former RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation; former RPC 1.6(a), prohibiting a lawyer from revealing confidences or secrets relating to representation of a client unless the client consents after consultation; former RPC 1.8(b) and former RPC 1.9(b), prohibiting a lawyer who is representing a client from using information, confidences, or secrets relating to the representation of a client to the disadvantage of the client unless the client consents after consultation; former 1.9(a), prohibiting a lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter from representing another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that personâ€™s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client consents in writing after consultation and a full disclosure of the material facts; former RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled; former RPC 3.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly disobeying an obligation under the rules of a tribunal except for an open refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists; and former 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Jonathan Burke represented the Bar Association.

Mr. Landau affirmatively admitted that the WSBA could prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence sufficient violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct supporting disbarment, but did not affirmatively admit all facts and misconduct herein. This resignation was based on conduct involving the crimes of false statement, obstruction of justice, and evasion of payment of taxes.In 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited Mr. Landauâ€™s tax returns for the years 2001 and 2002. The audit showed that Mr. Landau failed to declare a portion of his income for those years. In March 2003, Mr. Landau falsely stated in his signed declaration to the IRS that certain funds in his bank accounts were cash funds from his new fiancÃ©e, when in fact he knew that the deposits were checks from clients and income that should have been reported on his tax returns. That same month, Mr. Landau prepared and submitted to the IRS a false declaration, signed by his fiancÃ©e, which stated that deposits to this bank account were cash funds from his fiancÃ©e. Mr. Landau failed to disclose to the IRS client records and failed to disclose the existence of a bank account into which he had deposited more than $90,000 in undeclared gross receipts from his law practice. In tax returns submitted to the IRS for the years 2001 and 2002, Mr. Landau underreported and misrepresented his income, resulting in his evasion of income tax owed to the IRS. Mr. Landau was charged in U.S. District Court and found guilty of two counts of false statement, one count of obstruction of justice, and two counts of evasion of payment of taxes. Under ELC 10.14(c), Mr. Landauâ€™s convictions are conclusive evidence of his guilt of the crimes and violations of the statutes under which the convictions were based.Mr. Landauâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.Kathleen A.T.

1389.html,15432,Lindsay Thompson,,Disbarment,6/12/2009,,"Lindsay T. Thompson (WSBA No. 15432, admitted 1985), of Port Angeles, was disbarred, effective June 12, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline is based on conduct in two matters involving lack of diligence, failure to communicate, trust-account irregularities, and failure to protect clientsâ€™ interests, as well as noncooperation with a Bar Association investigation.Matter No. 1: Mr. Thompson represented Mr. and Mrs. H in a superior court case, which was set for trial on September 12, 2006. During the course of the representation, a dispute arose over their legal bills. In order to resolve the dispute, Mr. Thompson agreed to give Mr. and Mrs. H a credit of $9,555.85 against future bills. As of March 21, 2006, Mr. and Mrs. H had a credit balance of $2,836.58. On September 11, 2006, the day before trial was scheduled to begin, Mr. Thompson requested and was granted a continuance due to a health issue. After the September 11, 2006, hearing, Mr. Thompson failed to respond to communications from his clients or from opposing counsel about setting a new trial date. He was ordered to appear for a status conference on November 6, 2006, during which he informed the court that he would continue to act as counsel for Mr. and Mrs. H. The trial was set for January 23, 2007. Immediately after the status conference, Mr. Thompson agreed to meet with Mr. and Mrs. H at his law office to prepare for trial. Subsequently, however, Mr. Thompson failed to meet with the clients and failed to respond to their letters, telephone calls, and e-mails. On December 28, 2006, Mr. and Mrs. H asked the court to order Mr. Thompson to return their files so they could prepare for trial with the assistance of new counsel. They had been unable to contact Mr. Thompson since the November 6, 2006, status conference. At a hearing on January 5, 2007, the trial date was stricken. The Association made numerous attempts to assist Mr. and Mrs. H in obtaining their files by contacting Mr. Thompson by mail, e-mail, and telephone, but he did not respond. On February 7, 2007, Lawyer B filed a notice of appearance on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. H. On February 12, 2007, Mr. and Mrs. H obtained Mr. Thompsonâ€™s new address and telephone number in Port Angeles from a third party. At Mr. and Mrs. Hâ€™s request, Mr. Thompson sent Lawyer B a notice of withdrawal on February 24, 2007. In March 2007, Mr. and Mrs. H drove all the way from their home in Oysterville to Mr. Thompsonâ€™s home in Port Angeles to ask him for their files. Mr. Thompson took them to a nearby storage unit and gave the files to them. As of this date, Mr. and Mrs. H still have a credit balance of $2,836.58 that Mr. Thompson has not refunded.Matter No. 2: In March 2006, Mr. Thompson and his former law partner (Mr. G) dissolved their partnership. Mr. Thompson took over the files and the firmâ€™s accounts, which included a client (Client E) who had a $5,154.17 credit balance. On October 13, 2006, Client E wrote to Mr. Thompson to inquire about his balance and to request an accounting. Mr. Thompson did not respond. In April 2007, Client E learned from Mr. G that the firm had been dissolved and that Mr. Thompson retained Client Eâ€™s file and the firmâ€™s accounts, including Client Eâ€™s credit balance. Mr. G provided Client E with Mr. Thompsonâ€™s new address and telephone number. On April 10, 2007, Client E wrote to Mr. Thompson at his new address to request a refund of any advance payment of fees or costs that had not been earned or incurred. Along with his letter, Client E provided Mr. Thompson with a detailed â€œStatement of Account,â€ which included, among other things, copies of the checks he had sent to the law firm. Mr. Thompson received Client Eâ€™s letter, but he did not respond. Between April 9, 2007, and May 14, 2007, Client E left at least four voice-mail messages for Mr. Thompson, but he did not respond. On Friday, May 25, 2007, the Associationâ€™s consumer affairs assistant contacted Mr. Thompson by telephone. Mr. Thompson stated that he had received Client Eâ€™s letter, that he was drafting a response, and that he would mail his response to Client E over the weekend. As of the time of publication, Mr. Thompson had never sent a response, and Client E still has a credit balance of $5,154.17 that Mr. Thompson has not yet refunded.Between January 31, 2007, and June 14, 2007, the Association mailed to Mr. Thompson requests for responses to grievances filed against him by Client H and Client E. Mr. Thompson did not provide responses to the grievances. The Associationâ€™s investigator left telephone messages for Mr. Thompson and left business cards at his residence along with requests that Mr. Thompson contact her, but he did not respond. In July and August 2007, notices were mailed to Mr. Thompson by certified mail informing him that he would be subject to discipline and liable for the costs of a deposition if he failed to provide a written responses to the grievances. The notices were returned marked â€œUnclaimed.â€ Mr. Thompson was personally served with two subpoenas duces tecum commanding him to appear for a deposition on September 14, 2007. On the afternoon of September 13, 2007, Mr. Thompson sent a fax to disciplinary counsel requesting that the â€œmeeting be rescheduledâ€ because he was â€œunable to arrange transportation [from Port Angeles] to Seattle.â€ Disciplinary counsel informed Mr. Thompson by fax, by telephone message, and by mail that the deposition would be continued to September 20, 2007. Mr. Thompson failed to attend the deposition. Mr. Thompson has made no attempt to reschedule the deposition or to communicate with disciplinary counsel in any way since the afternoon of September 13, 2007.Mr. Thompsonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to promptly inform the client of any decisions or circumstance where clientâ€™s informed consent is required, reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the clientâ€™s objectives are to be accomplished, keep the client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.15A(e), requiring a lawyer to promptly provide a written accounting to a client or third person after distribution of property or upon request; RPC 1.15A(f), requiring that, except as stated in the rules, a lawyer must promptly pay or deliver to the client or third person the property which the client or third person is entitled to receive; RPC 1.16(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client or, where the representation has already commenced, requiring a lawyer to withdraw from the representation of a client, if the representation will result in violations of the rules of professional conduct or other laws; RPC 1.16(a)(2), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the lawyerâ€™s physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyerâ€™s ability to represent the client; RPC 1.16(d), requiring that a lawyer, upon termination of representation, take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Scott G.

1391.html,18208,Therese Wheaton,,Resignation in Lieu of Disbarment,6/8/2009,,"Therese M. Wheaton (WSBA No. 18208, admitted 1988), of Shelton, resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective June 8, 2009. Ms. Wheaton affirmatively admitted that the WSBA could prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence sufficient violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct supporting disbarment, but did not affirmatively admit all facts and misconduct herein. This discipline is based on conduct involving failing to provide competent representation, failing to act with reasonable diligence, charging unreasonable fees, trust-account irregularities, committing criminal acts, inducing a client to engage in criminal acts, and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.In April 2005, Client M paid Ms. Wheaton $1,000 to sue a cabinet distributor (CD) for installing faulty cabinets in his home in 2004. The fee agreement, signed on April 12, 2005, charged an initial â€œretainerâ€ of $1,000, which covered the initial consultation through the filing of the complaint and temporary orders, if necessary. The agreement provided that the $1,000 fee was â€œearned upon receiptâ€ and that the fee could be disbursed to counsel upon the clientâ€™s signature on the initial pleadings. The fee agreement required Client M to pay $150 per hour for services beyond those covered by the $1,000 â€œretainer,â€ with a cap of $2,000 â€œunless further approval.â€ The agreement allowed Ms. Wheaton to request additional sums for future fees and costs, provided that these funds would be deposited into her trust account. Ms. Wheaton placed the $1,000 in her trust account. Client M contacted Ms. Wheaton several times about the status of the case, and she told him repeatedly that it was not â€œhis turnâ€ on her schedule. During this time, Client M discovered that the cabinets installed by CD had mold in them. Client M states that Respondent told him that this would require the hiring of an expert on the issue of mold. In January 2006, Ms. Wheaton had Client M sign another fee agreement, and pay an additional $2,500 â€œnon-refundableâ€ fee. This agreement was for â€œlegal matters pertaining to home.â€ Ms. Wheaton told Client M that these additional funds were required for a mold expert. As in the first agreement, the fee could be disbursed to Ms. Wheaton only upon Client Mâ€™s signature on the initial pleadings. Ms. Wheatonâ€™s billing records show no work on Client Mâ€™s cabinet matter between the signing of the first and second fee agreements. From April 2006 through July 21, 2006, Ms. Wheaton recorded approximately eight hoursâ€™ worth of time on Client Mâ€™s matter for a total of $1,050 in fees. She took $1,050 out of her trust account on July 31, 2006, despite the fact that her fee agreement did not allow her to do so until client M signed the initial pleadings in the matter. On September 13, 2006, Client Mâ€™s wife gave Ms. Wheaton an additional $1,000. Ms. Wheaton told Mrs. M that she did not have enough money to pay her staff. Mrs. M offered Ms. Wheaton $1,000 as an advance against the fees that she would earn on the case. Ms. Wheaton did not put this money in her trust account. In a deposition taken on July 16, 2008, Ms. Wheaton falsely testified that the $1,000 was for bedroom furniture that Mrs. M purchased from Ms. Wheaton.Ms. Wheaton did not begin work on drafting the summons and complaint in Client Mâ€™s case until November 2006. On November 13, 2006, Ms. Wheaton took $1,000 from her trust account. This amount was $295 more than what was owed, according to the invoice that she produced. Because Client M had not yet signed the initial pleadings, no money was owed under the fee agreement. Client M terminated Ms. Wheatonâ€™s services on February 7, 2007, and hired Attorney B. Ms. Wheaton told Attorney B that she had forwarded the summons and complaint to Client M on January 19, 2007, and had no response from him; however, review of the properties of the complaint from Ms. Wheatonâ€™s computer shows that the complaint was not created until January 29, 2007. Client M denies that he received the complaint from Ms. Wheaton. On February 26, 2007, Ms. Wheaton deposited $1,150 back into her trust account and refunded $2,300 to Client M. Under Washington law, a claim against a contractorâ€™s bond must be filed within two years after the work was substantially completed. Ms. Wheaton failed to file a claim within two years.Client M takes hydrocodone and a generic form of Vicodin for severe neck and back pain. During the time that Ms. Wheaton represented Client M, she asked for his prescription pain medication on a monthly basis. Client M gave her his prescription medication at least 18 times, which often left him without his prescription pain medication for himself. Ms. Wheaton promised to replenish his supply when she got her own prescription filled, but never did. Client M and his wife feared that Ms. Wheaton would drop their case if he didnâ€™t give the drugs to her. Ms. Wheaton testified that she never asked Client M for the prescription pain medication. She further testified that she has a severe allergy to hydrocodone and Vicodin and has not taken any form of hydrocodone since she discovered her allergy when she was 19 years old. Ms. Wheatonâ€™s former legal assistant stated that she has seen Ms. Wheaton take Vicodin and that Ms. Wheaton has told her that she has taken Vicodin. Hydrocodone and Vicodin are controlled substances under RCW 69.50.206. Ms. Wheatonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; former RPC 1.2(d), prohibiting a lawyer from counseling a client to engage, or assisting a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal and fraudulent (here, through a violation of RCW 69.50.401(1), Delivery of a Controlled Substance); former RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm, including advances for costs and expenses, shall be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts maintained as set forth in the rules, and that no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm shall be deposited therein; former RPC 1.15A(b), prohibiting a lawyer from using, converting, borrowing, or pledging client or third-person property for the lawyerâ€™s own use; former RPC 1.15A(c), requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients and third persons separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property, to deposit and hold in a trust account funds subject to this rule pursuant to the rules and to identify, label, and appropriately safeguard any property of clients or third persons other than funds; former RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (through a violation of RCW 69.50.4013, Possession of a Controlled Substance without a Prescription and RCW 9A.28.020, Criminal Attempt) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects, and former RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.

This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to comply with mandatory continuing legal education requirements and conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation.Mr. Luke was reciprocally admitted to the practice of law in the state of Idaho in 2002. Following his admission, he was required to complete a Practical Skills Seminar. Mr. Luke did not attend the applicable Practical Skills Seminar and misrepresented to the Idaho State Bar that he completed the seminar. The Idaho State Bar records indicated that Mr. Luke had not registered for the seminar, did not sign in at the seminar, did not pay for the seminar, and submitted false information to the Bar seeking to confirm his attendance. When Mr. Luke was unable to demonstrate that he attended the required seminar, the Idaho State Bar requested that he be transferred to inactive status. The Idaho Supreme Court transferred him to inactive status in November 2002. The Idaho State Bar filed a formal complaint against Mr. Luke in 2007 when he sought to return to active status in Idaho. Mr. Luke stipulated to imposition of a reprimand in Idaho, and Idaho approved the stipulation in January 2008.

Kenison (WSBA No. 19613, admitted 1990), of Moses Lake, was suspended for 60 days, effective July 14, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to provide competent representation, failure to communicate, making a false statement of material fact to a third person, and dishonesty.Mr. Kenison is a general practitioner with a practice in Moses Lake. On May 29, 2006, Mr. D was arrested and charged for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Mr. D retained Mr. Kenison to represent him. Mr. Dâ€™s arrest for DUI precipitated a Department of Licensing (DOL) proceeding. After his arrest, Mr. D received notice from the DOL that they intended to suspend his license within 60 days. Mr. D also received notice from the DOL that he had a right to request an administrative hearing to contest his license suspension. Mr. D decided to contest the DOL license suspension, and completed and forwarded the required paperwork to request a hearing. Mr. D listed Mr. Kenison as his lawyer on the DOL paperwork and informed Mr. Kenison that he wanted to contest the proposed suspension. On July 5, 2006, the DOL sent Mr. D a â€œNotice of Administrative Hearing by Telephoneâ€ (notice). The notice set the hearing for July 26, 2006. Mr. Kenison was copied on and received the notice. On July 19, 2006, Mr. D pleaded guilty to negligent driving in the first degree (with alcohol involved). On July 25, 2006, Mr. Kenison faxed a letter to the DOL hearing officer enclosing a copy of Mr. Dâ€™s plea agreement. Mr. Kenisonâ€™s letter to the DOL hearing officer contains a handwritten notation stating â€œwondering if the 26th hearing is still necessary.â€ Although the legality and circumstances of Mr. Dâ€™s arrest were relevant to the DOL proceeding, the fact of his conviction was not. On July 26, 2006, Mr. Kenison faxed a letter to the DOL hearing officer stating that Mr. D â€œwithdraws the request for hearing.â€ As a result of this request, Mr. Dâ€™s DOL hearing was cancelled. It is disputed whether Mr. Kenison consulted with his client regarding withdrawing the request for the DOL hearing. Mr. Kenison did not communicate with Mr. D to update him as to what had occurred on the DOL matter on July 26, 2006. Mr. D called Mr. Kenison several times after July 26, 2006, to obtain information as to what had occurred. Mr. Kenison did not return Mr. Dâ€™s telephone calls. On August 2, 2006, the DOL sent a letter to Mr. D stating that his license was suspended for 90 days, effective July 29, 2006. Mr. Kenison was copied on and received the August 2, 2006, letter. In late July or early August 2006, Mr. D hired a new attorney to represent him in the DOL proceeding. Shortly thereafter, the new attorney called Mr. Kenison to ascertain the status of the DOL proceeding. During this telephone conversation, Mr. Kenison failed to tell the new attorney that he had withdrawn Mr. Dâ€™s request for a DOL hearing. Instead, Mr. Kenison stated that the DOL hearing had been held on July 26, 2006, and that a transcript would eventually become available, which was false.Mr. Kenisonâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 4.1(a), prohibiting a lawyer, in the course of representing a client, from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; and former RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Kevin M.

1397.html,29263,Stephen Oelrich,,Suspension,2/9/2009,,"Stephen J. Oelrich (WSBA No. 29263, admitted 1999), of Tacoma, was suspended for three years, effective February 9, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court. This discipline is based on conduct in six matters involving failure to provide competent representation, failure to abide by clientsâ€™ objectives, lack of diligence, failure to communicate, failure to return unearned funds, and conduct involving misrepresentation.Matter No. 1: In March 2005, Mr. B paid Mr. Oelrich $2,000 to represent him in a child-support modification, to obtain a restraining order against his ex-wife, and to defend him in a contempt action for his alleged failure to pay child support and uninsured medical expenses. Mr. B was in the United States Army stationed in Virginia; he communicated with Mr. Oelrich by e-mail and relied on him to handle matters. One of Mr. Bâ€™s objectives was to obtain a restraining order against his ex-wife to keep her from harassing him at work. Mr. Oelrich drafted a petition and Mr. B signed it. Mr. Oelrich never filed the petition. As a result, when Mr. Bâ€™s ex-wife harassed him at work, Mr. B had no recourse. Mr. Bâ€™s contempt hearing was originally scheduled for April 2005, but was rescheduled several times and ultimately re-set for June 2005. Mr. Oelrich requested a continuance because he had not completed the necessary paperwork. The court granted the continuance, but ordered a $250 sanction against Mr. B for the delay. Because Mr. B had questions about his case and had spoken to Mr. Oelrich directly on only one occasion, he called Mr. Oelrichâ€™s office almost every day between June 2, 2005, and June 20, 2005. Mr. Oelrich never returned the calls. Mr. Oelrich did not inform Mr. B about the sanction. He then filed Mr. Bâ€™s response late, and the court refused to consider it. The court did not find Mr. B in contempt, but made several orders regarding healthcare, daycare costs, and attorneyâ€™s fees. The court granted Mr. B a $41-per-month credit for ordinary healthcare costs. The court also ordered that if the mother did not provide documentation of daycare costs to Mr. Oelrich, daycare costs would be immediately reduced. This would have had the effect of reducing Mr. Bâ€™s child-support obligation by $134.50 per month. Mr. Oelrich never sent Mr. B a copy of the order and did not adequately explain the impact of the order. Further, he never pursued the reduction in Mr. Bâ€™s child-support obligation for the healthcare credit or when the mother failed to provide the required daycare documentation. In September 2005, Mr. B received a letter from the Division of Child Support (DCS) stating that his paycheck would be garnished for current and past-due support obligations. This did not take into account the daycare adjustment. Mr. B contacted Mr. Oelrich, who assured him that he would take care of it. In October 2005 and December 2005, Mr. B received two more letters from DCS stating that they were going to garnish his wages. Mr. Oelrich took no action on behalf of Mr. B with DCS or in superior court to prevent the garnishment. Mr. Oelrich took no action to follow through with implementing a court-ordered reduction of Mr. Bâ€™s child support obligation. During the course of the representation, Mr. Oelrich never responded to Mr. Bâ€™s questions and concerns on other matters. Mr. B ultimately hired another lawyer to implement the courtâ€™s order and clarify his child-support obligations, but his tax refund was seized and he overpaid healthcare expenses. Matter No. 2: Mr. H hired Mr. Oelrich to pursue a personal injury case against Clark County on a contingency fee basis for an injury he received while incarcerated. The statute of limitations for this injury was three years and expired on October 30, 2003. Mr. H called Mr. Oelrich numerous times, urging him to file his claim. Mr. Oelrich did not return Mr. Hâ€™s calls. In November 2002, Mr. H paid Mr. Oelrich a filing fee of $110 to ensure that his case would be filed within the three-year statute of limitations. Thereafter, Mr. H left messages on Mr. Oelrichâ€™s answering machine urging him to file his claim. Mr. Oelrich did not return Mr. Hâ€™s calls. Mr. Oelrich filed a suit against Clark County on June 17, 2004. The suit was filed in Thurston County, which was the wrong venue, according to statute. In addition, the statute of limitations had already expired on the date of filing and Mr. Oelrich did not serve any of the defendants within 90 days of filing his complaint. The defendants brought a motion to dismiss. Mr. Oelrich stated that his failure to serve defendants within 90 days was excusable neglect, due to â€œa simple act of oversight.â€ The court rejected Mr. Oelrichâ€™s arguments, and Mr. Hâ€™s case was dismissed with prejudice. Matter No. 3: Mr. F hired Mr. Oelrich to represent him in a child-support-modification action in early June 2005. Mr. F was in the Armed Forces and deployed in Iraq. Mr. Fâ€™s main concern was that his child support would increase based on extra pay that he was receiving due to his deployment. Mr. Fâ€™s extra pay was scheduled to end in November 2005, when he returned from Iraq. Mr. F wanted to ensure that his child support would not be based on this pay after November 2005. Mr. F and Mr. Oelrich agreed that contact between them would be by e-mail and telephone. Mr. F paid Mr. Oelrich $1,000. The fee agreement provided for an hourly billing rate. The modification hearing was scheduled for June 24, 2005. On that day, Mr. Oelrich e-mailed Mr. F requesting â€œbasic information.â€ Mr. F responded with the answers and requested that he be notified of the outcome of the hearing. Mr. Oelrich sent Mr. F an e-mail a few days later explaining that the hearing was stricken because â€˜â€™we needed to have more time to respond.â€ This was the last communication Mr. F had from Mr. Oelrich. The hearing was reset for July 22, 2005. Mr. Oelrich received notice of the new hearing date on June 27, 2005. Mr. Oelrich did not attend the July 22, 2005, hearing or inform Mr. F of the new date. A modification order was entered by default and was mailed to Mr. F by the prosecutor. This order increased Mr. Fâ€™s child-support obligation based on his deployment pay. Mr. F tried repeatedly to contact the respondent, without success. Mr. Oelrich did little, if anything to earn his fee on this matter, yet he did not return any of Mr. Fâ€™s fees. In August 2005, Mr. F sent additional e-mails and a letter to the respondent requesting information on his case and an accounting of his fees. Mr. Oelrich did not send Mr. F a statement for his services or otherwise account for the $1,000 that Mr. F paid him. Matter No. 4: Ms. S hired Mr. Oelrich in 2003 to represent her in an employment discrimination lawsuit filed against her former employer and her labor union. On March 3, 2004, the court dismissed Ms. Sâ€™s claims following defendantsâ€™ motion for summary judgment. On March 26, 2004, Mr. Oelrich filed a Notice of Appeal in the Ninth Circuit. The Court set a briefing schedule that required Mr. Oelrich to file the opening brief by May 18, 2004, and mailed a copy of the order to him. On April 22, 2004, the court issued an order setting an assessment conference for May 21, 2004. Mr. Oelrich received a copy on April 23, 2004. On May 21, 2004, the court entered an order rescheduling the settlement assessment conference to June 22, 2004. Mr. Oelrich received a copy of this order as well. Mr. Oelrich did not attend the conference and did not return telephone messages left by court staff on his answering machine and with his staff. On June 29, 2004, the court issued an order requiring Mr. Oelrich to file a notice within seven days indicating dates and times he would make himself available for a continuation of the settlement assessment conference. The order warned that failure to comply could result in dismissal of the appeal or sanctions. On July 16, 2004, Ms. Sâ€™s appeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute. Mr. Oelrichâ€™s offices received this order on July 19, 2004. Ms. S tried unsuccessfully to reach Mr. Oelrich numerous times. He failed to return her calls. After months of failed attempts, Ms. S finally met with Mr. Oelrich. In his answer to the Bar Associationâ€™s complaint, Mr. Oelrich admitted that he told Ms. S that he missed the appeal deadline for her matter because he never received the courtâ€™s scheduling order, but stated that this was not a misrepresentation. Ms. S hired Attorney B to review her case. Attorney B determined that, given the courtâ€™s attempts to contact Mr. Oelrich, there was little or no chance that they would reinstate Ms. Sâ€™s appeal. Matter No. 5: In September 2003, Mr. and Mrs. N paid Mr. Oelrich $2,000 to represent them in a child-custody-modification action against Mr. Nâ€™s ex-wife. After the modification action was filed, Mr. N decided that he wanted to transfer legal custody of his son to his ex-wife. He asked Mr. Oelrich to accomplish this. In December 2003, the ex-wifeâ€™s attorney (Lawyer C) set a hearing for December 30, 2003, to enter a final parenting plan. On that day, Mr. Oelrich signed a parenting plan drafted by Lawyer C without discussing it with Mr. N. This plan, while changing the residential time, did not change the designation of custodian to the mother. Mr. Oelrich did not provide Mr. or Mrs. N with a copy of the plan, despite repeated requests. In February 2004, Lawyer C wrote to Mr. Oelrich and informed him that Mr. N had claimed his son as an exemption on his 2003 tax return, in violation of a court order. Lawyer C requested a written assurance that Mr. N would file an amended return or she would bring a contempt action against Mr. N. Mr. Oelrich did not answer Lawyer Câ€™s letter or inform Mr. and Mrs. N of the letter. Had they been informed of Lawyer Câ€™s letter, Mr. and Mrs. N would have filed an amended return to avoid a contempt action. On February 20, 2004, Lawyer C filed a contempt motion. The hearing was set for March 9, 2004. In support of her motion, Mr. Nâ€™s ex-wife described Lawyer Câ€™s attempts to contact Mr. Oelrich. Mr. N was served with an Order to Show Cause a few days before the contempt hearing. Mrs. N called Mr. Oelrich several times, but he did not return her calls. On March 5, 2004, Mr. Oelrichâ€™s assistant told Mrs. N that Mr. Oelrich could not attend the hearing. Mrs. N requested that Mr. Oelrich call her. Mr. Oelrich did not return her call or ask the court to continue the hearing. Mr. N attended the March 9, 2004, hearing and represented himself. At the hearing, Mr. N was held in contempt and ordered to pay attorneyâ€™s fees and costs of $195. After failing to obtain a copy of the final parenting plan from Mr. Oelrich, Mrs. N obtained one from Superior Court. It was only then that Mr. and Mrs. N realized that the final plan designated Mr. N as custodian of his son, contrary to his objectives. Mrs. N wrote Mr. Oelrich a letter detailing her complaints. Mr. Oelrich met Mrs. N at a restaurant to give her Mr. Nâ€™s file. Mr. Oelrich apologized profusely and blamed Lawyer C for the errors. He promised to remedy the parenting plan. Mrs. N contacted Mr. Oelrich on numerous occasions after that meeting, but Mr. Oelrich failed to return her calls. Mr. and Mrs. N eventually paid another attorney $2,500 to amend the final parenting plan. Matter No. 6: Mrs. X contacted Mr. Oelrich in 2003 because her mother was preparing to sue her over a loan that Mrs. Xâ€™s mother had made to her. Mrs. X asked Mr. Oelrich to assist her in settling the matter. Mr. Oelrich told Mrs. X that he had written a letter and sent it to her motherâ€™s attorney twice, but Mrs. X never received a copy of the letter, despite repeated requests. On July 13, 2003, Mrs. X gave Mr. Oelrich a cashierâ€™s check to send to her motherâ€™s attorney, but Mr. Oelrich never forwarded the check. On March 2, 2005, Mrs. Xâ€™s mother sued Mrs. X and her husband in Pierce County Superior Court. The trial was scheduled for September 14, 2005. Mr. and Mrs. X took leave from work and appeared at the courthouse, but were informed when they arrived that the trial had been cancelled. Mrs. X e-mailed Mr. Oelrich requesting information, but did not receive a response. On September 23, 2005, Mr. Oelrich e-mailed a member of his staff and told her to call Mr. and Mrs. X that day to explain to them that the case had been reset because the opposing attorney had not perfected the case for trial. Mr. Oelrich stated in the e-mail that his office had identified a problem with the e-mail system and this would be explained in a letter he would write to Mr. and Mrs. X. Mr. Oelrich did not send a letter to them. The case against Mr. and Mrs. X was calendared again in the spring of 2006. In an e-mail dated March 1, 2006, Mrs. X specifically asked Mr. Oelrich if he could settle the case without going to trial. Mr. Oelrich did not pursue a settlement. Between March and June 2006, Mr. Oelrich did not respond to Mrs. Xâ€™s frequent calls to his office for updates on the case. The court set a settlement conference for June 8, 2006, but it was re-scheduled at Mrs. Xâ€™s request. She met with Mr. Oelrich and asked him again to settle the case. On June 9, 2006, Mr. Oelrich wrote a letter to Mr. and Mrs. X stating that he intended to withdraw. After Mr. Oelrich withdrew, Mrs. X hired another attorney to represent her at the settlement conference. The case settled at the conference after about an hour. Mrs. X has repeatedly requested a copy of her file from Mr. Oelrich, who has not responded.  Mr. Oelrichâ€™s conduct in these six matters violated RPC 1.1., requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; former RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and to consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.14(b), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of client funds and property, and to promptly pay the funds to the client upon request; former RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as surrendering paper and property to which the client is entitled and returning any advance payment of fee that has not been earned; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in coFrancesca Dâ€™Angelo represented the Bar Association.

1398.html,18616,A. Vanderveen,,Disbarment,7/16/2009,,"A. Mark Vanderveen (WSBA No. 18616, admitted 1989), of Kenmore, was disbarred, effective July 16, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. This discipline resulted from conduct involving the commission of a felony and dishonesty. For further information, see In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Vanderveen, 211 P.3d 1008 (2009).On February 29, 2005, Attorney W asked Mr. Vanderveen to represent Mr. C, who was under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for involvement in a drug ring. Attorney W represented one of the top men in the drug ring, who was also Mr. Câ€™s superior. Mr. Vanderveen agreed to represent Mr. C and told him at their first meeting that Mr. Câ€™s â€œfriends or associatesâ€ would pay his attorney fees. Mr. C agreed. Attorney W paid Mr. Vanderveen $20,000 in cash in two installments for his representation of Mr. C. On March 17, 2005, Attorney W left the first cash payment of approximately $10,000 in a paper bag in the court chambers where both he and Mr. Vanderveen sat as pro tempore judges. Attorney W gave Mr. Vanderveen the remaining $10,000 cash within a couple of weeks by delivering it to him in a parking lot outside of a bank. According to Mr. Vanderveen, Attorney W told him â€œthe people [Mr. C] works with have given me some money, and I can pass it on to you.â€Mr. Vanderveenâ€™s ordinary business practice with regard to receipt of legal fees in the form of cash was to deposit them in the bank on the same day he received them, photocopy the payment for his records, and enter them into his Quickbooks accounting system. When he received attorney Wâ€™s cash payments, Mr. Vanderveen did not follow his ordinary practice. Instead, he placed each of the payments in his home safe. Further, Mr. Vanderveen failed to report the receipt of the cash payments as required by 31 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5331(a) and 5322. In exchange for the $20,000 he received from Attorney W, Mr. Vanderveen represented Mr. C beginning in early March 2005. During that time, Mr. Vanderveen acceded to requests from Attorney W, on behalf of Attorney Wâ€™s client, to help them get information from or about Mr. C. For example, Mr. Vanderveen helped Attorney W conduct surveillance of Mr. C without Mr. Câ€™s knowledge or approval. With Mr. Vanderveenâ€™s assistance, Attorney W had Mr. C followed to discover if Mr. C had taken a trailer full of marijuana or was cooperating with law enforcement.In early May 2005, federal authorities informed Attorney W that he was under investigation for involvement in his clientâ€™s drug ring. Attorney W agreed to cooperate with authorities and recorded a phone conversation between him and Mr. Vanderveen, in which they discussed the cash payments Attorney W made to Mr. Vanderveen and Mr. Vanderveenâ€™s failure to report them. As a result, on July 22, 2005, Mr. Vanderveen was charged with and entered a guilty plea to violations of 31 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5331(a) and 5322 (willful failure to file a currency report).The court imposed a three-month prison sentence, to be followed by home detention. After serving his prison term, Mr. Vanderveen served 90 daysâ€™ home detention, during which he was required to wear an ankle bracelet. On the last day of his detention, Mr. Vanderveen removed his bracelet and left his home. Due to this probation violation, he was sentenced to six additional days in prison and 30 additional days in home detention.Mr. Vanderveenâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Christine Gray represented the Bar Association.

1399.html,27073,Kyle Nolte,,Reprimand,6/18/2009,,"Kyle W. Nolte (WSBA No. 27073, admitted 1997), of Spokane Valley, was ordered to receive a reprimand on June 18, 2009, following approval of a stipulation by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on conduct involving failing to disclose a prior disciplinary sanction on his applications to serve as a Rule 9 supervising lawyer.On December 3, 2004, Mr. Nolte received a reprimand from the Association for his misconduct while serving as an officer in the United States Air Force Judge Advocate General Department. In 2006, 2007, and 2008, Mr. Nolte signed a Declaration of Supervising Lawyer and agreed to act as the supervising lawyer for a legal intern under Rule 9(d) of the Admission to Practice Rules (APR). Mr. Nolteâ€™s declarations were forwarded to the Association as part of the admission process for a Rule 9 legal intern. At all relevant times, APR 9 (Legal Interns) subsection (d) (Supervising Lawyer) included the proviso: â€œIf a disciplinary sanction has been imposed upon the lawyer within the 5 years immediately preceding approval of the application, the Board of Governors shall have the discretion to accept or reject the lawyer as a supervising lawyer.â€ The Declaration of Supervising Lawyer that Mr. Nolte signed in 2006, 2007, and 2008, included the following paragraph: â€œI, ____ , Bar No. ____, hereby certify as follows: (1) I am an active member in good standing of the Washington State Bar Association and have had no disciplinary sanctions imposed in the last five years.â€ Before Mr. Nolte completed the 2006 declaration, he called and asked the Association whether he could serve as a supervising lawyer and if so, how he should complete the Declaration of Supervising Lawyer. Mr. Nolte was advised to indicate he had received prior disciplinary action on the declaration form. On May 19, 2006, Mr. Nolte signed, under penalty of perjury, a Declaration of Supervising Lawyer to act as the Rule 9 supervisor by filling in his name and number and altering paragraph (1) by crossing out the word â€œnoâ€ and adding his initials. The Associationâ€™s Regulatory Services Department (RSD) approved the application, and Intern A worked in Mr. Nolteâ€™s law office as a Rule 9 legal intern. On March 6, 2007, Mr. Nolte signed a second declaration under penalty of perjury to serve as a Rule 9 supervising lawyer for Intern B On this declaration, he failed to cross out the word â€œnoâ€ or otherwise indicate that he had a disciplinary sanction imposed in the last five years. RSD approved the application, and Intern B worked in Mr. Nolteâ€™s law office as a Rule 9 legal intern. On July 23, 2008, Mr. Nolte signed a third declaration under penalty of perjury to serve as a Rule 9 supervising lawyer for Intern C. Again, on this declaration he did not cross out the word â€œnoâ€ or otherwise indicate he had a disciplinary sanction imposed in the last five years. In August 2008, RSD denied Mr. Nolteâ€™s request to serve as Intern Câ€™s Rule 9 supervising lawyer and referred the matter to the Associationâ€™s Office of Disciplinary Counsel.Mr. Nolteâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.1, prohibiting a lawyer in connection with a bar admission or reinstatement application from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or failing to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter.Linda B.

14.html,11622,Michael Jacob,,Suspension,9/1/2000,,"Michael L. Jacob (WSBA No. 11622, admitted 1981), of Bainbridge Island, was suspended for 18 months following a stipulation approved by order of the Supreme Court dated September 1, 2000. The discipline is based upon his lack of diligence in several family law matters.Matter 1: In April 1995, Mr. Jacob agreed to represent the father in a child-support modification. Mr. Jacob told the client that his $697 monthly payment was clearly excessive, and that the modification would be straightforward.On July 27, 1995, Mr. Jacob filed the clientâ€™s petition for support modification. Although Mr. Jacob and the client had discussed filing a motion for temporary orders, Mr. Jacob did not file those pleadings. The parties were unable to reach agreement, so Mr. Jacob obtained a June 21, 1996 trial date. Mr. Jacob failed to serve notice of this trial date on opposing counsel. When Mr. Jacob discovered that opposing counsel was unaware of the trial date, he agreed to strike that date. Opposing counsel wrote to Mr. Jacob several times between July 1996 and January 1997, however, Mr. Jacob did not respond. Consequently, opposing counsel notified Mr. Jacob that he would object to any reduced child-support amount becoming effective retroactively.In August 1996, the client filed a grievance with the WSBA stating that his case was still active after 16 months, and that Mr. Jacob would not return his calls. Mr. Jacob twice told his client that the trial would occur within a few weeks, but this did not happen. Between April and November 1997, several trial dates were set and cancelled. In April and July 1997, opposing counsel filed motions to dismiss the petition. Mr. Jacob agreed to pay opposing counsel $600 as compensation for these motions. As of the date of the stipulation, Mr. Jacob had paid only $200 of this amount. On November 6, 1997, the client retained substituted counsel. On November 17, 1997, the court entered an agreed order of child support, reducing the clientâ€™s payment to $550 per month effective December 1, 1997.Matter 2: In September 1994, Mr. Jacob agreed to represent the husband in a marriage dissolution matter. Mr. Jacob filed the petition for dissolution on March 6, 1995. On March 28, 1995, opposing counsel wrote Mr. Jacob a letter about the division of the assets and liabilities in the case. On May 5, 1995, opposing counsel contacted Mr. Jacob by phone, asking why he had not received an answer to his letter. Mr. Jacob promised to respond to the letter, but did not do so.On June 23, 1995, opposing counsel sent Mr. Jacob a letter requesting that his client vacate the condominium shared by the clients. Mr. Jacobâ€™s client did leave the condominium, but allegedly took various items of community and separate property. Opposing counsel wrote Mr. Jacob three letters requesting that his client return the property. Mr. Jacob did not respond to any of these letters. On June 27, 1995, opposing counsel served Mr. Jacob with interrogatories and requests for production. Mr. Jacob did not provide the answers or requested documents by the due date. Opposing counsel filed a motion to compel answers to the interrogatories, award possession of the condo, require the return of the property, and for a restraining order and terms. Mr. Jacob did not inform his client of the motion, did not file a response to the motion, and did not appear at the hearing. The court ordered the client to return the property, and answer the interrogatories and requests for production by August 17; it awarded possession of the condo to the wife, awarded opposing counsel $750 in fees, and continued the hearing until August 18. Mr. Jacob did not submit answers to the interrogatories or requests for production by the courtâ€™s deadline, and did not attend the hearing or tell his client about the hearing.On August 18, the court found the client in contempt, provided that he could purge the contempt finding by providing answers to the interrogatories by August 24, 1995, continued the hearing to August 25, and assessed an additional $250 in terms. Mr. Jacob sent the client the interrogatories for the first time in mid-August. He did not tell the client about the court orders, but paid the $1,000 imposed by the court himself. Mr. Jacob did submit interrogatory answers to opposing counsel, but opposing counsel notified Mr. Jacob that he believed the answers were inadequate and filed a motion for an order to show cause regarding the contempt judgment.Mr. Jacob and his client appeared in court for the hearing on November 17, 1995. The court ordered that the client provide additional information, continued the hearing, and awarded an additional $600 in attorneyâ€™s fees. Mr. Jacob told his client that he would pay one-half of the awarded fees, but he has not done so. Following a conference, the parties reached agreement. The court entered the decree of dissolution on March 29, 1996. Mr. Jacob did not provide a copy of the decree to his client.Matter 3: On February 28, 1995, Mr. Jacob agreed to represent the husband in a marriage dissolution matter. Although the client believed that Mr. Jacob would file the petition for dissolution immediately, he did not file it until October 29, 1996. The client also thought that Mr. Jacob would seek temporary orders, but he did not do so.On December 4, 1996, opposing counsel sent requests for interrogatories and production to Mr. Jacob, but he did not respond. Mr. Jacob also failed to attend or file pleadings responding to opposing counselâ€™s temporary orders hearing. At that hearing, the court required Mr. Jacobâ€™s client to pay $753 per month in child support, restricted his residential time with his children, and entered a $1,500 judgment against the client for the wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees. Mr. Jacob did not inform his client of this court order.On April 10, 1997, opposing counsel filed a motion requesting that the court enter an order compelling answers to his discovery requests. In response, Mr. Jacob filed a notice of withdrawal. The court entered an order compelling discovery and requiring Mr. Jacobâ€™s client to pay an additional $350 in terms.Matter 4: On May 6, 1996, Mr. Jacob agreed to represent the wife in a marriage dissolution action. Mr. Jacob prepared the petition for dissolution and arranged for the husband to be served in California. On June 19, 1996, the client notified Mr. Jacob that she had retained other counsel. In October 1996, the client requested a refund of the $1,690 fee she had paid. On May 8, 1997, Mr. Jacob returned $500 to the client, stating that this was one-third of her refund. He promised to make two additional monthly payments, but had not done so by the date of the stipulation.Matter 5: On November 7, 1996, Mr. Jacob agreed to represent the father in a hearing, scheduled for that same day, regarding $25,000 in back-due child support. The client paid Mr. Jacob $1,500. Mr. Jacob and opposing counsel agreed to continue the hearing in exchange for a $3,963 payment from Mr. Jacobâ€™s client. After reviewing information from opposing counsel, Mr. Jacob agreed that his client owed $10,975.19 in back child support. Based on this conclusion, Mr. Jacob decided not to file a response for the hearing. Mr. Jacob did not notify his client of his agreement regarding the amount or his decision not to respond. At the December 13, 1996 hearing, with Mr. Jacobâ€™s agreement, the court entered a $8,975.19 judgment against the client. Approximately 10 days later, the client retained new counsel.Matter 6: On September 12, 1996, Mr. Jacob agreed to represent a husband and wife in two matters, a stepparent adoption and a residential placement modification. The clients paid Mr. Jacob a total of $2,350 for both matters. Initially, Mr. Jacob told the clients that both matters should be completed by the end of the 1996-1997 school year.On May 27, 1997, the client called the court and discovered that Mr. Jacob had not yet filed the petitions with the court. Although Mr. Jacob promised to file both petitions right away, he did not. On July 14, 1997, the clients discharged Mr. Jacob and requested a refund. Mr. Jacob did not respond to this request. On February 6, 1998, the clients obtained a $2,300 small-claims judgment against Mr. Jacob. As of the date of the stipulation, Mr. Jacob had not paid the judgment.Matter 7: On September 28, 1995, Mr. Jacob agreed to represent a husband in a child-support collection case. Although the client was subject to a child-support order, he believed he was not the childâ€™s father, and requested that Mr. Jacob stop the collection. The client paid Mr. Jacob $1,500.In either October or November 1995, the Office of Support Enforcement notified the client that he was released from his child-support obligation. In May 1997, the client obtained a credit report verifying that he did not owe child support and that the past-due amounts had been removed. Mr. Jacob advised the client to take no further action. In August or September 1998, the client began receiving notices from the Hawaii OSE regarding back-due child support. In October 1998, after several attempts to speak with Mr. Jacob, the client requested his file and a refund of his fees. Mr. Jacob returned the clientâ€™s file in January 1999, but as of the stipulation date, had not returned the fees.Matter 8: On June 17, 1998, Mr. Jacob received the Supreme Court order suspending his license to practice law in Washington for failing to pay the required WSBA dues. On July 9, 1998, Mr. Jacob sent a bankruptcy questionnaire to a client and signed the attached letter as Michael Jacob, Attorney at Law. Mr. Jacob met with this client, executed a fee agreement, and accepted a $595 fee. Later, the client found that Mr. Jacobâ€™s telephone was disconnected and that the receptionist at the office did not know how to locate Mr. Jacob. The client went to the bankruptcy court and learned that Mr. Jacob had not filed his petition. As of the stipulation date, Mr. Jacob had not returned the clientâ€™s money.Mr. Jacobâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent clients; 3.2, requiring lawyers to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their cases; 1.5, requiring lawyers to charge a reasonable fee for their services; 1.15, requiring lawyers to promptly deliver client funds to clients upon request; and 1.2, requiring lawyers to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions regarding the scope of representation.Marsha Matsumoto represented the Bar Association.

1401.html,23805,Larry Botimer,,Suspension,8/20/2009,,"Larry A. Botimer (WSBA No. 23805, admitted 1994), of Federal Way, was suspended for six months, effective August 20, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. For further information, see In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Botimer, 166 Wn 2.d 759, 214 P.3d 133 (2009). This discipline is based on conduct involving revealing client confidences and conflicts of interest. After he retired from the IRS, Mr. Botimer established a law practice that focused on tax work. Mr. Botimer served for several years as a tax preparer for the R family. From 1995 to 2000, he prepared yearly tax returns for Mrs. R and, from 1995 to 2001, he did the same for Mrs. Râ€™s son JR and JRâ€™s wife. Mr. Botimer assisted Mrs. R with decisions related to her ownership stake in a Seattle nursing home facility. In 1992, Mrs. R retired from the Seattle business but retained ownership of the property, leasing it back to JR and his wife. Mr. Botimer advised JR and his wife regarding incorporation of the Seattle business as a subchapter S corporation, and he advised Mrs. R about creating a â€œconsulting businessâ€ as part of an overall tax strategy. Mr. Botimer also prepared tax returns for the Seattle business.Mr. Botimer also assisted Mrs. R with business matters related to a Spokane care facility run by her other son, MR. The Spokane facility is incorporated under subchapter S. Mrs. R guaranteed loans for the Spokane facility and secured these loans with her Seattle real property, yet received no stock in the Spokane business. Mr. Botimer advised her as to her options regarding the Spokane facility, including restructuring the business so that Mrs. R could both be involved in management of the Spokane facility and receive potential tax benefits reflecting the Spokane businessâ€™s losses on her own tax returns. Controversy arose when MR would not recognize that his mother or brother had an ownership stake in the Spokane business. Both brothers disagreed as to the extent of each oneâ€™s stock ownership. Mr. Botimer assisted JR and his wife in negotiations with MR regarding potential solutions. Mr. Botimer did not obtain conflict waivers in the course of his assistance of the various members of the R family and did not discuss with them the advantages and disadvantages of joint representation. Mr. Botimer did not use a written client engagement agreement or any other method to obtain consent in writing to the conflicts.Mrs. R, JR, and JRâ€™s wife decided to close the Seattle nursing care facility and sell the property in August 2000. The proceeds of this sale were to go to the three family members, with JR and his wife expecting half. Mr. Botimer also requested that his fees be paid out of these proceeds. Upon the sale, Mrs. R did not share the proceeds with JR, JRâ€™s wife, or Mr. Botimer. Instead, she used the proceeds to satisfy her loan guarantees to the Spokane business. In 2002, Mr. Botimer terminated his representation of Mrs. R with a letter stating that â€œher failure to cooperate with him, refusal to follow his advice and failure to pay for [his] legal servicesâ€ led to his decision. The letter also informed Mrs. R that Mr. Botimer was sending correspondence to the IRS to inform the agency â€œthat [Mrs. Râ€™s tax] returns do not contain a true record of your taxable income and that you neglected to report gifts made to your son.â€ Without seeking or obtaining Mrs. Râ€™s consent, Mr. Botimer followed through and sent the letter to the IRS informing the agency of Mrs. Râ€™s failure to, contrary to his advice, correctly state her income and pay gift tax. The letter also contained allegations that Mrs. R had illegally invested her grandchildrenâ€™s trust property.To resolve disputes stemming from the sale of the Seattle property, JR and his wife sued Mrs. R, MR, and the Spokane business in 2004. Mr. Botimer cooperated with JR and his wifeâ€™s attorney in the lawsuit, and provided the attorney with three declarations to use in pretrial proceedings. The declarations contained detailed background information about Mrs. Râ€™s business affairs related to the Seattle business, as well as information about her estate plans. He attached copies of Mrs. Râ€™s tax returns and other documents related to his prior tax preparation work. Mr. Botimer also included information describing JR and his wifeâ€™s lease of the Seattle property and business transactions with MR as tax avoidance tactics. Mrs. R did not give her consent to these disclosures, and no court ordered this revelation of Mrs. Râ€™s client information. Mr. Botimerâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.6, prohibiting a lawyer from revealing confidences or secrets relating to representation of a client unless the client consents after consultation; former RPC 1.7, prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client will be directly adverse to another client unless the lawyer reasonably believes that the representation will not adversely affect the relationship with the other client and each client consents in writing after consultation and a full disclosure of the material facts; and former 1.9(b), prohibiting a lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter from thereafter using confidences or secrets relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former client.Randy V.

Chiu (WSBA No. 23462, admitted 1993), of Houston, Texas, was disbarred, effective August 25, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court imposing reciprocal discipline in accordance with an order from the Evidentiary Panel of the Texas State Bar District No. 4F11 Grievance Committee. This discipline was based on conduct involving trust-account irregularities. In or around July 2005, Mr. Chiu represented two clients in a personal injury matter that occurred in California. When the case ultimately settled, the clients authorized Mr. Chiu to pay their medical providers with available settlement proceeds. Mr. Chiu, however, failed to notify or promptly tender payment to Dr. S for the medical services rendered to the clients. Once Dr. S learned of the settlement, his attorney made numerous attempts to contact Mr. Chiu to secure payment. Finally, on April 27, 2006, Mr. Chiu sent two checks made payable to Dr. S on behalf of the clients. The checks were drawn on Mr. Chiuâ€™s IOLTA account. When Dr. S presented the checks for payment, they were returned because the account had been closed. Dr. Sâ€™s attorney again made numerous attempts to collect payment from Mr. Chiu. On August 11, 2006, Mr. Chiu sent two more checks in the same amount to cover the aforementioned medical expenses on behalf of his clients, as well as a check to cover the expenses incurred by Dr. S. These checks were drawn on a second IOLTA account at a second bank. One of the checks for services and the expense check were thereafter returned for insufficient funds. On March 6, 2007, Mr. Chiu sent a payment to cover the costs of the returned checks; however, this check, which had been drawn on Mr. Chiuâ€™s operating account, was also returned for insufficient funds. Mr. Chiuâ€™s conduct violated Texas RPC 1.14(a), failing to hold funds or other property belonging in whole or in part to clients or third persons that are in a lawyerâ€™s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property in a separate trust account designated as a trust or escrow account; Texas RPC 1.14(b), upon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third person has an interest, failing to promptly notify the client or third person; failing to promptly deliver to the client or third person any funds or other property that the client or third person is entitled to receive; and upon request by the client or third person, failing to promptly render full accounting regarding such property; and Texas RPC 8.04(a)(3), engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Joanne S.

Oelrich (WSBA No. 29263, admitted 1999), of Tacoma, was disbarred, effective June 24, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to communicate, non-cooperation in a disciplinary investigation, and violations of duties imposed under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.On March16, 2007, Mr. J paid Mr. Oelrich $2,500 to represent him in gaining visitation rights with his eight-year-old son. Mr. Oelrich filed a petition for establishment of parentage, a proposed parenting plan, and motion for a restraining order on Mr. Jâ€™s behalf on March 27, 2007. In response, the mother of the child alleged that Mr. J was not the father of the child. Mr. J took a paternity test and it was determined that he was not the biological father of the child. Mr. J told Mr. Oelrich that he wanted to pursue visitation anyway. Mr. Oelrich did not contact Mr. J for several weeks and then told Mr. J that it appeared the childâ€™s mother was going to contest visitation. On May 30, 2007, Mr. J wrote to Mr. Oelrich and told him that he had decided not to pursue visitation over objections from the childâ€™s mother. He told Mr. Oelrich that he wanted to see about having his child support suspended and his name taken off the childâ€™s birth certificate. He also stated that he wanted to pursue a civil action against the childâ€™s mother. The same day, Mr. Oelrich replied that he would take care of the requests. Mr. Oelrich did nothing further. Mr. J e-mailed and called Mr. Oelrich several times, but did not hear from him again until nearly a month later, when Mr. Oelrich e-mailed Mr. J and told him that he was sick and would send an e-mail at a later date. This was the last communication that Mr. J had with Mr. Oelrich. Mr. J called and e-mailed Mr. Oelrich and went to his office several times. Each time, the office was closed. The trial date in the paternity matter was set for August 24, 2007. Mr. J requested Mr. Oelrichâ€™s presence at the court date. Mr. Oelrich did not respond. Mr. J took the day off work and appeared for court, but was told that the trial had been continued. Mr. Oelrich knew that the trial had been continued but failed to notify Mr. J. Mr. J sent Mr. Oelrich a letter via certified mail in which he requested that Mr. Oelrich withdraw from the case and refund his retainer. Mr. Oelrich received this letter, but did not withdraw, refund Mr. Jâ€™s money, or contact Mr. J. Mr. J could not afford to hire another attorney and could not proceed pro se because Mr. Oelrich had not withdrawn. Mr. J filed a grievance against Oelrich. By letters dated August 31, 2007, and October 3, 2007, the Association requested a response from Mr. Oelrich, but he did not respond to either letter. The Association issued and personally served a subpoena on Mr. Oelrich, requiring him to appear at a deposition on December 26, 2007. Mr. Oelrich failed to respond or appear at the deposition. The Association petitioned for Mr. Oelrichâ€™s interim suspension. The Supreme Court issued an order scheduling a hearing on the Associationâ€™s petition for February 28, 2008. Mr. Oelrich was served with the order but failed to appear, and his license to practice law was suspended on March 3, 2008. On March 5, 2008, the Association sent Mr. Oelrich a letter outlining his duties on suspension, including the requirement that, within 25 days of his suspension, he file an affidavit showing full compliance with the provisions of Title 14. Mr. Oelrich has not filed the required affidavit.Mr. Oelrichâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a)(3), requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses; RPC 1.16(d), requiring that, upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here, ELC 1.5 and ELC 14.3).Erica Temple represented the Bar Association.

1408.html,26825,Yong Han,,Suspension,6/25/2009,,"Yong J. Han (WSBA No. 26825, admitted 1997), of Snoqualmie, was suspended for three years, effective June 25, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court. This discipline is based on conduct involving lack of communication; trust-account irregularities; charging unreasonable fees; failure to protect client funds; failure to properly supervise lawyer and nonlawyer employees working under him; and conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Since his admission, Mr. Han has maintained his own law office, practicing primarily in the areas of criminal defense and personal injury. Between approximately 2003 and 2005, Mr. Han also handled escrows. Between 1998 and 2006, Mr. Han engaged in the following conduct:â€¢ Failed to keep adequate trust-account records, including failing to keep check registers, client ledgers, or a running balance of the IOLTA account, and failing to timely review bank statements or reconcile the statements with the trust account; â€¢ Disbursed trust funds before the corresponding deposits had been made and/or cleared the banking process;â€¢ Failed to properly account for and/or failed to promptly pay to five different clients the funds that the clients were entitled to receive; â€¢ Charged or collected a fee from these five previously mentioned clients in excess of the fee set out in his contingent fee agreement;â€¢ Failed to adequately supervise a subordinate employee lawyerâ€™s preparation of settlement statements, and also failed to adequately supervise that subordinate employee lawyerâ€™s disbursements of personal injury clientsâ€™ funds;â€¢ Failed to adequately supervise his non-lawyer employees to ensure that they maintained accurate records of client funds; and, because his non-lawyer employees failed to maintain accurate client accounts, Mr. Han retained excess monies that subrogated insurers declined to collect from settlements, rather than properly distributing those funds to the clients; andâ€¢ Failed to provide clients with settlement statements that accurately showed the fees his firm received.Mr. Hanâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable; former RPC 1.5(b), requiring that when a lawyer has not regularly represented the client, or if the fee agreement is substantially different than that previously used by the parties, the basis or rate of the fee or factors involved in determining the charges for legal services and the lawyerâ€™s billing practices shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation; former RPC 1.5(c), requiring contingent fee agreements to clearly state the method by which the fee is to be determined and that a detailed settlement statement be provided to the client upon completion of the case; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds paid to a lawyer or law firm, including advances for costs and expenses, shall be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts, maintained as set forth in the rules, and no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm shall be deposited therein; former RPC 1.14(b), requiring a lawyer to (i) maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive and (ii) promptly pay or deliver to a client as requested by a client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive; former RPC 5.1(a), requiring a partner in a law firm to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurances that all lawyers in the firm conform to the Rules of Professional Conduct; former RPC 5.1(b), requiring a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over another lawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the other lawyer conforms to the Rules of Professional Conduct; former RPC 5.3(a), requiring a partner in a law firm to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurances that a non-lawyer employeeâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; former RPC 5.3(b), requiring a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over a non-lawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the personâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.

1411.html,15830,Bradley Marshall,,Disbarment,10/1/2009,,"Bradley R. Marshall (WSBA No. 15830, admitted 1986), of Seattle, was disbarred, effective October 1, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. This discipline was based on conduct involving forcing settlement contrary to clientsâ€™ wishes, charging unreasonable fees, conflicts of interest, trust account irregularities, failing to properly account to a client funds paid by the client, violating the Rules of Professional Conduct, making misleading statements to clients and disciplinary counsel, and engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. For more information, see In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Marshall, 167 Wn.2d 51, 217 P.3d 291 (2009).In October 2000, Mr. Marshall agreed to represent two former members of a Masonic organization in bringing a lawsuit against their chapter. He sent a written fee agreement to the clients, which was for joint representation for a flat â€œnon-refundable feeâ€ of $15,000. In January 2001, Mr. Marshall filed a lawsuit against the Masonic chapter (chapter) and against another defendant on behalf of his clients (Clients A and B). In February 2001, Mr. Marshall agreed to represent a third individual (Client C), also a former member of the chapter, who paid him a $7,500 flat fee. Despite Client B having previously objected to adding Client C to their lawsuit, Mr. Marshall joined Client C as a plaintiff via amended complaint. Mr. Marshall did not advise any client in writing or obtain a written waiver. The chapter filed an answer, filed counter claims against all three plaintiffs, and filed third-party complaints against Clients Aâ€™s and Câ€™s husbands, who were also former members of the chapter. The chapter also brought a lawsuit against all three plaintiffs. Mr. Marshall agreed to represent Clients Aâ€™s and Câ€™s husbands for a flat-fee payment from both men totaling $19,000 and without obtaining consent in writing from any of his clients concerning a potential conflict of interest. All relevant lawsuits were consolidated in December 2001.In April 2002, Mr. Marshall negotiated a settlement on behalf of Clients A, B, and C as to two individual defendants named in the litigation (not the chapter). Each client was to receive $12,500. The money was paid and deposited in Mr. Marshallâ€™s trust account. In June 2002, at a mediation proceeding, the chapter attempted to reach a settlement resolving all pending claims in the consolidated litigation. As a result, Mr. Marshall, the judge for the mediation, counsel for the chapter, and some of the clients thought settlement had been reached. However, no written settlement agreement was signed by any of the clients, no written stipulation was executed, and all clients confirmed to Mr. Marshall that they had not agreed to a settlement. Mr. Marshall informed each of the clients that they would have to pay him an additional $15,000 each for his continued representation. Clients B and C refused to pay, arguing that their agreement was for a flat fee that they had already paid. By letter dated June 17, 2002, Mr. Marshall attempted to get Clients B and C to settle with the chapter, enclosing the release documents for signature and writing: â€œThe Court has directed [Clients B and C to] sign the release and settlement agreement and the Chapter to do the same in order to consummate this matter.â€ This statement was not true. Clients B and C refused to sign the release and each wrote to Mr. Marshall stating their objections. Mr. Marshall responded by letter, dated July 31, 2002, that it was his â€œunderstanding that you each have settled your caseâ€ and stating that their claims had been dismissed and would not be heard at trial. However, the claims had not been dismissed as of that date. In August 2002, the chapter filed a motion to compel Clients B and C to execute a settlement agreement with them. Mr. Marshall did not oppose the motion, although he had opposed a similar motion filed against those clients who had agreed to pay additional fees. There is evidence Mr. Marshall had sent the chapterâ€™s counsel a copy of his July 31, 2002, letter to his clients. The chapterâ€™s counsel testified that Mr. Marshall recommended that the chapter should bring the Motion to Compel Settlement. Client B wrote to the court attempting to oppose the motion pro se. Mr. Marshall wrote Client C in January 2003, inquiring whether she was still interested in pursuing claims and writing that, in order to proceed to trial, Client C would need to forward a check to him in the amount of $15,000 by January 23, 2003. In June 2002, Mr. Marshall also began representing another former member of the chapter (Client D) in the lawsuit. Client D was paying Mr. Marshall on an hourly basis. Client D initially paid Mr. Marshall $1,000 on June 13, 2002. Mr. Marshall did not deposit any portion of the $1,000 into his client trust account. Over the next few months, Mr. Marshall billed Client D at an hourly rate of $175 per hour. Client D paid all of the invoices in full. In January 2003, Mr. Marshall met with Client D and agreed to complete her representation for a flat fee of an additional $5,000. He also agreed to prepare an amended fee agreement, which he never prepared. On January 27, 2003, Client D sent a $5,000 cashierâ€™s check to Mr. Marshallâ€™s office along with a handwritten note indicating it was for completing her case per their agreement. In March 2003, Mr. Marshall represented Clients A and D in the lawsuit against the chapter. He did not represent Clients B and C, who still refused to pay the additional fees. The jury awarded $3,500 each to Clients A and D. Although Mr. Marshall agreed to represent Client D for the $5,000 flat fee, he sent her an invoice dated April 1, 2003, charging her $21,787.50 for professional legal services between March 10, 2003, and March 29, 2003. Through a different attorney, Client D challenged the invoice. Mr. Marshall filed an attorneyâ€™s lien for $21,787.50 and then filed a lawsuit against her. Mr. Marshall dropped the lawsuit after Client D filed a grievance against Mr. Marshall. At the hearing against him, Mr. Marshall claimed his demand to clients for additional payments was for costs. However, his costs after January 21, 2003, through the completion of trial totaled $53.92.Mr. Marshallâ€™s conduct violated former 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and to consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; former RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable; former RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation will be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to another client, a third person, or the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless (1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the relationship with the other client, and (2) each client consents in writing after consultation and a full disclosure of the material facts; former 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of a client paid to a lawyer be deposited into an identifiable interest-bearing trust account and that no funds belonging to the lawyer be deposited therein; former RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; former RPC 8.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct; former RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; former RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and former RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Christine Gray and Scott G.

Doran (WSBA No. 15107, admitted 1985), of Coeur dâ€™Alene, Idaho, was suspended for three months, effective October 7, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline is based on conduct involving the commission of multiple misdemeanors and violating court orders. James R. Doran is to be distinguished from James M. Doran, of Bellingham.On August 28, 2005, Mr. Doran was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in Lincoln County. Mr. Doranâ€™s breathalyzer test revealed a blood alcohol level of .08. On November 3, 2005, Mr. Doran entered a guilty plea to driving under the influence (DUI) in Lincoln County District Court, and was convicted of a gross misdemeanor. Mr. Doran was sentenced to 364 days in jail, with 363 days suspended for two years; a fine of $2,500, with $1,650 suspended; 12 months of supervised probation; and 12 months of unsupervised probation. He was also ordered not to drive a motor vehicle without a valid license and insurance and not to commit any criminal traffic violations. On February 11, 2006, Mr. Doran was driving while license suspended in Okanogan County. He was cited for driving while license suspended in the third degree. On July 7, 2006, Mr. Doran entered into a Stipulated Order of Continuance in Okanogan District Court. On April 3, 2007, Mr. Doran was driving under the influence in Okanogan County. Based on his April 3, 2007, actions in Okanogan County, Mr. Doranâ€™s suspended sentence in the Lincoln County case was revoked on June 12, 2007. He was sentenced to 30 days, with 333 days of suspended jail time remaining. Mr. Doranâ€™s probation supervision was extended to July 1, 2008, and his probation conditions were expanded to require that an interlock ignition device be on any vehicle driven by him. Mr. Doran entered into a deferred prosecution on August 31, 2007. On April 16, 2008, Mr. Doran was driving a motor vehicle while his license was suspended in the second degree and without an ignition interlock device in Garfield County.

1413.html,11560,Daniel Wright,,Disbarment,10/6/2009,,"Daniel A. Wright (WSBA No. 11560, admitted 1981), of Tumwater was disbarred, effective October 6, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court, following a default hearing. This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to act with reasonable diligence, failure to communicate, making false statements in connection with a disciplinary matter, dishonest conduct, and violating a duty imposed under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct.In September 2005, a client hired Mr. Wright to represent her in the dissolution of her marriage. As part of the dissolution, the clientâ€™s husband executed a promissory note in favor of the client, which was secured by a trust deed on a certain piece of real property. The clientâ€™s husband executed the note and trust deed on or about February 1, 2007. Mr. Wright did not record the promissory note or trust deed. In June 2007, the client retrieved her client file from the firm where Mr. Wright was an associate. She subsequently learned that the trust deed had not been recorded and that a senior lien holder had foreclosed on the property on May 7, 2007. On August 14, 2007, the client telephoned Mr. Wright about his failure to record the trust deed. Mr. Wright told his client that she had instructed him not to record the trust deed and that he had sent her a letter at that time confirming those instructions. The client told Mr. Wright that she had not given him instructions not to record the trust deed. She also told Mr. Wright that she had not received any letter from him confirming those instructions and that she intended to file a grievance with the Association. Mr. Wright wrote and sent the client a follow-up letter confirming the telephone conversation, including his assertion that she instructed him not to record the trust deed, and enclosed a copy of a letter dated February 12, 2007. The letter dated February 12, 2007, from Mr. Wright to the client, purported to confirm the clientâ€™s instructions to Mr. Wright not to file the trust deed. Mr. Wright represented to her that the letter had been created and mailed to her on February 12, 2007. In fact, Mr. Wright created the letter on August 14, 2007, after the telephone conversation with the client. In connection with the investigation of the grievance filed by the client, Mr. Wright falsely stated to the Association that the letter dated February 12, 2007, had been created and sent to the client on February 12, 2007.Mr. Wrightâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to promptly inform the client of any decision of circumstance with respect to which the clientâ€™s informed consent is required, reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the clientâ€™s objectives are to be accomplished, keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 8.1(a), prohibiting a lawyer, in connection with a disciplinary matter, from knowingly making a false statement of material fact; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter (here, ELC 5.3(e)).Debra J.

1415.html,1470,Philip King,,Disbarment,10/30/2009,,"Philip M. King (WSBA No. 1470, admitted 1969), of Mercer Island, was disbarred, effective October 30, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. In stipulating to disbarment, Mr. King affirmatively admitted that there was a substantial likelihood the WSBA could prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence sufficient violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct supporting disbarment, but did not affirmatively admit all the facts and misconduct. This discipline resulted from conduct involving the commission of a criminal act and dishonesty. The misconduct described in the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law for In re the Estate of Elizabeth L. King (attached and incorporated into the stipulation but not affirmatively admitted by Mr. King) are as follows:Mr. Kingâ€™s mother died on May 19, 2002. Her will was admitted to probate and Mr. King was appointed personal representative of her estate, with non-intervention powers, in June 2002. Mrs. Kingâ€™s will provided for distribution of her estate into three equal parts: one-third to her son, Phillip King; one-third to her daughter; and the remaining one-third in equal parts to each of her six grandchildren, the descendents of a deceased son. On January 22, 2003, Mrs. Kingâ€™s daughter filed and served a Request for Special Notice under RCW 11.28.240. Mr. King failed to comply with his fiduciary duties and provide petitioner with written notice before making distributions to himself or others from estate funds and assets after January 23, 2003.  For at least five years before his motherâ€™s death, Mr. King served without compensation as Mrs. Kingâ€™s attorney-in-fact under a General Power of Attorney, but did not file her personal tax returns for the time period 1997â€“May 19, 2002. In the two years before her death, Mr. King transferred via check and wire transfer over $300,000 from Mrs. Kingâ€™s accounts to his personal bank account for his personal use. Upon Mrs. Kingâ€™s death and Mr. Kingâ€™s subsequent appointment as Personal Representative, Mr. King disclosed only $65,000 of his debts to the estate. Mr. King concealed, and made no attempts to disclose, account for, or recoup or repay his remaining debt to the estate totaling $236,173.24. The net value of the estate as of Mrs. Kingâ€™s death was $818,349.53. Mr. King significantly underrepresented the value of the estate in three filings, under oath, with the court. Mr. King commingled estate funds with his personal funds and used estate funds to pay his personal expenses. Mr. King over-distributed estate funds to himself and left insufficient funds to pay the amount due to other beneficiaries.  In April 2007, Mr. King placed funds in an IOLTA account opened and controlled by his lawyers, including $10,000 as a reserve to pay his sisterâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. That amount was deficient by at least $169,538.27 to pay remaining, outstanding distributions to beneficiaries of the estate. In addition, his failure to timely file individual tax returns for Mrs. King (1997â€“May 19, 2002) until September 11, 2007, resulted in overpayment of approximately $18,000 that would have been refunded to Mrs. King during her lifetime or, subsequently, to her estate. Mr. King did not timely file estate tax returns and failed to comply with the courtâ€™s April 13, 2007, Preliminary Order directing â€œ[w]ithin 60 (sixty) days after entry of this Order, the Personal Representative shall file all tax returns related to the Estate.â€ The estate tax returns for the year ending April 30, 2006, were not filed until September 11, 2007. Mr. Kingâ€™s non-intervention powers were restricted by the court on April 13, 2007 and suspended on September 14, 2007.Mr. Kingâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Erica Temple represented the Bar Association.

1419.html,1695,James Holcomb,,Suspension,6/21/2008,,"James Byron Holcomb (WSBA No. 1695, admitted 1967), of Bainbridge Island, was suspended for three years, effective June 21, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline resulted from conduct in three matters involving failure to communicate, representation of clients in violation of the Rules, filing frivolous proceedings, practicing law while suspended, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, disobeying a court order, and violations of duties in connection with a disciplinary matter.Matter No. 1: On December 20, 2007, the Supreme Court suspended Mr. Holcomb from the practice of law for six months, effective immediately. Mr. Holcomb knew of the suspension and filed an Emergency Motion to Stay Suspension on January 3, 2008, which was denied. Prior to his suspension, Mr. Holcomb had filed a Notice of Appearance for Client A, who was charged with DUI in a district court matter. After being suspended, Mr. Holcomb did not advise Client A, the court, or opposing counsel of his suspension and did not withdraw from representing Client A. Mr. Holcomb appeared with Client A in court on January 7, 2008, to request a continuance in Client Aâ€™s matter, and on February 4, 2008, to enter a pre-trial diversion agreement. The presiding judge later discovered that Mr. Holcomb was suspended from the practice of law. The judge summoned Client A back to court to meet with another attorney and decide if he wished to continue with the diversion agreement, which the client later reaffirmed. Matter No. 2: In 2006, prior to his suspension, Mr. Holcomb began representing Client B, who was charged with DUI in a district court matter. After being suspended, Mr. Holcomb did not notify Client B, the court, or opposing counsel of his suspension and did not withdraw from representing Client B. Mr. Holcomb appeared in court with Client B on February 5, 2008, when Client B entered a guilty plea to a reduced charge. Mr. Holcomb also requested continuances of the sentencing date on Client Bâ€™s behalf and represented Client B in court at his sentencing on June 19, 2008.Matter No. 3: Client C hired Mr. Holcomb to represent him in appealing to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) his removal from a position with a federal employer. Mr. Holcomb filed a Notice of Appearance on behalf of Client C on April 25, 2006. The appeal went to hearing before an administrative judge (AJ). On October 10, 2006, prior to a decision being made, Mr. Holcomb filed a Motion to Supplement Argument on Appeal, asserting that Client C had a mentally handicapping condition that rendered him incompetent to withdraw the appeal, and asked the AJ to order a mental evaluation. On that same date, Client C notified the AJ and Mr. Holcomb by letter that he wished to withdraw his appeal so that he could pursue his claim through arbitration. Client C also notified the AJ and Mr. Holcomb that he had terminated Mr. Holcombâ€™s representation. The AJ denied Mr. Holcombâ€™s motion and dismissed the appeal, finding that Client C was acting knowingly and voluntarily when he requested dismissal of his appeal. Client C settled his claim with the federal employer, but did not advise the MSPB or Mr. Holcomb of the settlement. Mr. Holcomb filed a petition for review of the AJâ€™s decision with the MSPB, claiming to act on behalf of Client C, and again asserting that Client C had a mentally handicapping condition that rendered him incompetent to withdraw the appeal and asking the MSPB to order a mental evaluation. Client C had not re-authorized Mr. Holcomb to act on his behalf. The Clerk of the MSPB entered an order to show cause directed to Client C stating that the Board would not accept the petition for review unless it received within 15 days a â€œDesignation of Representationâ€ signed by Client C indicating that he had once again designated Mr. Holcomb as his representative. Client C did not respond to the order and the MSPB dismissed Mr. Holcombâ€™s petition for review. Mr. Holcomb filed a petition for review of the MSPBâ€™s dismissal in the U.S. Court of Appeals, stating in the petition that he was representing Client C even though Client C had not authorized him to file the petition for review. The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal because Mr. Holcomb failed to demonstrate that he was Client Câ€™s representative. The Court of Appeals ordered Mr. Holcomb to show cause why he should not be sanctioned for filing a frivolous appeal. Mr. Holcomb made various arguments in response which were all rejected, and the court found that his appeal was frivolous. Mr. Holcomb was ordered to pay $2,000 to the federal employer.Mr. Holcombâ€™s conduct violated RPC1.4, requiring a lawyer to promptly inform the client of any decision of circumstance with respect to which the clientâ€™s informed consent is required, reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the clientâ€™s objectives are to be accomplished, keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, consult with the client about any relevant limitations, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.16(a)(1), requiring a lawyer to terminate representation where representation results in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law; RPC 3.1, prohibiting a lawyer from bringing or defending a proceeding unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous; RPC 5.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction; RPC 5.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in the practice of law while suspended from the practice of law for any cause; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; RPC 8.4(j), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order directing him or her to do or cease doing an act which he or she ought in good faith to do or forbear; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.M.

142.html,3020,Richard Twiss,,Disbarment,6/8/2001,,"Richard S. Twiss (WSBA No. 3020, admitted 1970), of Seattle, was disbarred effective June 8, 2001, by order of the Supreme Court, following a stipulation. The discipline is based upon misrepresentations he made in 1991 and 1992 in a business deal.Mr. Twiss and Mr. Wheeler were business partners in two boxing-promotion businesses named Wheeler and Associates, Inc. (W&A) and Wheeler China, Inc. In February 1991, a Chinese company (CX) contacted Mr. Wheeler to arrange a boxing competition in China. CX and W&A signed an agreement to put on a boxing competition in China. Mr. Wheeler conducted most of the business with CX. Mr. Twiss obtained most of his information from Mr. Wheeler. Mr. Wheeler read portions of the correspondence to Mr. Twiss. Over a three-month period, CX paid W&A $3.1 million, which Mr. Wheeler deposited into his personal checking account. On December 31, 1991, $700,000 of this money was wired to boxer George Foreman, but he did not sign to participate in the event.In March 1992, Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Twiss traveled to China to meet with CX. W&A signed a new agreement with CX during this trip. Mr. Wheeler excluded Mr. Twiss from many of the meetings. During this time, Mr. Twiss was suffering from alcoholism and depression. Because Mr. Twiss did not have much to do, he was drinking more than usual. In March 1992, while still in China, Mr. Twiss, at Mr. Wheelerâ€™s direction, signed the names of two boxing managers to boxing service agreements. Mr. Twiss testified that, based on information he obtained from Mr. Wheeler, he believed that the life of Mr. G (the CX representative) would be in danger if Mr. Twiss did not sign the boxing managersâ€™ names to the contracts.Also in 1992, Mr. Wheeler wrote a letter to CX stating that W&A had advanced $1.8 million to the two boxers involved in the above agreements. Mr. Twiss repeated this statement to representatives of the China Agricultural Bank, which was lending money to CX for the boxing event. In fact, there were no valid agreements and W&A had not paid any advances. In May 1992, Mr. Wheeler stated falsely that the two boxing services contracts were canceled and that the $2.4 million advanced to the fighters was forfeited, because W&A and CX had not rescheduled the boxing match. Mr. G testified that Mr. Twiss repeated these statements. Mr. Twiss testified that he believed that the misrepresentations were made to allow Mr. G to get money out of China, because his life was in danger.In April and May 1992, CX wired W&A $3.1 million. On June 13, 1992, Mr. Wheeler transferred $98,000 to Mr. Twissâ€™s personal bank account. In August 1992, Mr. Twiss drafted a letter of credit on Seafirst Bank Private Banking stationery using the fictitious name Martin A. Oakley in the signature block. Mr. Wheeler signed this letter and presented it to CX, indicating it was a sample.On August 24, 1992, Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Twiss split the remaining funds received from CX. Mr. Wheeler arranged for a boxing promotion firm to handle the logistics of the October 17, 1992 fight. One of the boxers reported an injury several weeks before the fight, and the fight did not take place.The boxing event never occurred, and W&A did not return any of the funds advanced by CX. CX filed a lawsuit against W&A, Mr. Twiss and Mr. Wheeler individually for return of the funds advanced. Following a jury verdict, the Honorable Thomas S. Zilly awarded CX $2,519,803 jointly and severally against Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Twiss.In October 1997, Mr. Twiss began receiving treatment for his alcoholism and depression. Mr. Twiss has complied with all treatment recommendations since that time. During the hearing, Mr. Twissâ€™s treatment provider testified that his alcoholism significantly contibuted to his error in judgment.Mr. Twissâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; and 8.4(a), prohibiting knowingly assisting another person in violating the RPCs.Linda Eide represented the Bar Association.

In entering into the stipulation, Ms. Hong expressly did not waive her Fifth Amendment rights.The misconduct described in the Stipulation to Disbarment is as follows:Between December 2006 and August 2008, Ms. Hong received settlement funds on behalf of 31 separate clients, each of which Ms. Hong was representing in personal injury actions. Ms. Hong received and deposited into her trust account settlement funds for each client ranging from between $1,100 and $120,000. Ms. Hong failed to pay the entire balance of settlement funds belonging to clients pursuant to the fee agreements that Ms. Hong had with each of the clients. The unpaid balance of settlement funds for each client ranged from $733 to $26,511.72. In three of these personal injury actions, the clients involved did not agree to the settlements and did not endorse the settlement checks. In all but five of these personal injury actions, some or all of the unpaid settlement funds should have been paid to the clientsâ€™ insurance companies, each of which had unpaid subrogation claims on the settlement funds. Ms. Hongâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Christine E.

The suspension is to be followed by one yearâ€™s probation upon reinstatement. This discipline is based on conduct in 19 different immigration matters involving lack of diligent representation, failure to communicate, charging unreasonable fees, failure to protect clientsâ€™ interests, violating the Rules of Professional Conduct, and dishonest conduct.Mr. Mahr stipulated to engaging in the following conduct, between approximately May 2005 and May 2009, in one or more of the immigration matters:â€¢ Failed to diligently represent clients.â€¢ Failed to keep clients informed about the status of their matters, failed to respond to their inquiries, and failed to provide documentation to his clients and their families.â€¢ Prepared and filed motions for voluntary departure, change of venue, and withdrawal as counsel without notice to, consultation with, and approval of clients.â€¢ Failed to explain the scope of his representation and basis and factors involved in determining his charges to clients.â€¢ Attempted to charge, and charged, clients or their families additional fees after they already paid a flat fee.â€¢ Misrepresented to clients and their families that he would obtain the clientsâ€™ release from detention when, in fact, he did not, and misrepresented to one client and her husband the status of the clientâ€™s matter.â€¢ After being terminated by clients for providing services of little or no value, failed to refund the unearned portion of the clientsâ€™ fees and failed to return clientsâ€™ files.Mr. Mahrâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.2, requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and to consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to promptly inform the client of any decision of circumstance with respect to which the clientâ€™s informed consent is required by the Rules, reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the clientâ€™s objectives are to be accomplished, keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses; RPC 1.5(b), requiring that the scope of the representation and the basis or rate of the fee and expenses for which the client will be responsible be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation except when the lawyer will charge a regularly represented client on the same basis or rate; RPC 1.16(d), requiring a lawyer, upon termination of representation, to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred; RPC 8.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Kathleen A.

This discipline was based on conduct involving misrepresentations before a tribunal.On November 28, 2005, Mr. Conteh prepared an Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal (Application) on behalf of a client. Mr. Conteh signed the Application, attesting that it was based on information of which he had knowledge or which was provided to him by the client. Mr. Conteh also acknowledged that he would be subject to civil penalties for knowingly providing false information. In the Application, Mr. Conteh falsely represented that the client had resided at Mr. Contehâ€™s residence in Everett since June 2004. The client had never resided with Mr. Conteh. Mr. Conteh filed the Application with the United States Department of Homeland Security.On March 22, 2006, Mr. Conteh represented the client at an interview with an asylum officer. Consistent with the misrepresentations in the Application, the client told the asylum officer, in Mr. Contehâ€™s presence, that he had resided with Mr. Conteh since June 2004. The asylum officer concluded that the client was prohibited from applying for asylum and referred the Application to an immigration judge for hearing. Before the hearing, Mr. Conteh received the Governmentâ€™s Prehearing Statement, which included a copy of the asylum officerâ€™s Assessment to Refer. After he read the Assessment, Mr. Conteh recognized that his prior misrepresentation concerning the dates of the clientâ€™s residence with him could result in a denial of the Application. On July 31, 2006, Mr. Conteh represented the client at a hearing before an immigration judge. The Application that Mr. Conteh had prepared was admitted into evidence at the hearing. At the hearing, Mr. Conteh made a â€œcorrectionâ€ to the Application concerning the dates of the clientâ€™s residence with him. Mr. Conteh falsely represented to the immigration judge that the client had actually resided with him since June 2005. At the hearing, Mr. Conteh also offered false evidence through the testimony of the client that the client had resided with him since June 2005.Mr. Contehâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Scott G.

This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to act with diligence, failure to communicate, failure to protect clientsâ€™ interests, failure to cooperate with a bar association investigation, commission of a criminal act, and engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.

1431.html,1480,J. Kelley,,Suspension,1/6/2010,,"J. Porter Kelley (WSBA No. 1480, admitted 1954), of Tacoma, was suspended for one year, effective January 6, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline was based on conduct involving trust account irregularities, failure to maintain adequate records of client funds, and failure to provide an accounting to client of how funds were spent.In 2007â€“2008, Mr. Kelley represented a client in a family law matter. Mr. Kelley received $2,000 from the client as an advance fee, which he deposited directly into his general account instead of his trust account. Mr. Kelley eventually earned the $2,000 advance fee. As the case progressed, Mr. Kelley asked the client for fees as the work was performed. Mr. Kelleyâ€™s estimate of time spent was based on notations kept in his file, but he did not send contemporaneous billings to the client. Mr. Kelley deposited additional funds he received from the client into his general account. Mr. Kelley did not keep complete records of the funds he received from the client or provide the client with an accounting of the funds she paid him. He sent the client a billing statement after the case was completed and did not bill her for all the time he put into the case. As part of the investigation of the above matter, the Bar Association subpoenaed trust account records for the years 2006 to 2009 from Mr. Kelleyâ€™s bank and reviewed his trust account check register. Mr. Kelley did not maintain ledgers for individual clients and his trust account check register was incomplete. He failed to identify a client matter for each disbursement and failed to enter a balance after each transaction. In numerous instances, Mr. Kelley wrote checks out of trust to cash or to himself with no notation on the check or in the register as to the client matter. In at least two instances, Mr. Kelley deposited his own funds into the trust account. On one occasion, Mr. Kelley deposited a check made payable to him from his brother into the trust account and then, seven days later, withdrew the funds. The check from Mr. Kelleyâ€™s brother was a personal loan and was unrelated to any client matter. On another occasion, Mr. Kelley deposited his own funds into trust in order to pay the mediator in the above matter out of the trust account.Mr. Kelleyâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.15A(c), requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients and third persons separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property, which includes: (1) depositing and holding in a trust account funds subject to the rules, (2) depositing into a trust account legal fees and expenses paid in advance until earned or incurred, and (3) identifying, labeling, and appropriately safeguarding any property of clients or third persons other than funds and preserving such records for seven years after return of the property; RPC 1.15A(d), requiring a lawyer to promptly notify a client or third person of receipt of the client or third personâ€™s property; RPC 1.15A(e), requiring a lawyer to promptly provide a written accounting to a client or third person after distribution of property or upon request and to provide at least annually a written accounting to a client or third person for whom the lawyer is holding funds; RPC 1.15A(h)(1), prohibiting funds belonging to the lawyer from being deposited or retained in a trust account except (i) funds to pay bank charges, (ii) funds belonging in part to a client or third person and in part presently or potentially to the lawyer, or (iii) funds necessary to restore appropriate balances; RPC 1.15A(h)(2), requiring a lawyer to keep complete records as required by Rule 1.15B; RPC 1.15A(h)(5), requiring that all trust account withdrawals are made only to a named payee and not to cash; and RPC 1.15B(a), requiring a lawyer to maintain current trust account records.Joanne S.

1432.html,14686,Greg Tichy,,Disbarment,1/13/2010,,"Greg R. Tichy (WSBA No. 14686, admitted 1984), of Liberty Lake, was disbarred, effective January 13, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on conduct in several matters involving lack of diligence, trust account irregularities, practicing law while suspended, theft, dishonest conduct, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, disregard for a court order, and non-cooperation in a disciplinary investigation.Matter No. 1: Beginning in 2005, Mr. Tichy represented Client A in an employment matter. In March 2007, the parties in the matter settled their dispute for $14,000. Having previously paid Mr. Tichy a flat fee for representation, Client A was entitled to all of the settlement funds. Mr. Tichy deposited the $14,000 settlement check into his general business account instead of his trust account. In May 2007, Mr. Tichy paid Client A $7,000 of the settlement funds, converting the remaining $7,000 to his own use. Client A subsequently sued Mr. Tichy for the remaining $7,000 of settlement funds and obtained a judgment against him, which Mr. Tichy paid.Matter No. 2: Beginning in April 2007, Mr. Tichy represented Client B in an employment contract matter. Between April 13 and July 19, 2007, Client B made three advance payments of hourly fees to Mr. Tichy totaling $4,500. Mr. Tichy did not deposit the payments into his trust account and converted the funds to his own use before being entitled to receive them. Although Mr. Tichy eventually worked on Client Bâ€™s case, he provided no accounting or billing statements to Client B prior to December 2007. In July 2007, the opposing party in the matter indicated they were not willing to settle. Mr. Tichy informed Client B that he would immediately file a lawsuit. Client B paid Mr. Tichy another $500 in August 2007, to be used for filing fees and costs connected to the lawsuit. Mr. Tichy cashed the $500 check, converting the funds to his own use, and failed to file the lawsuit. In September 2007, Client B requested a refund of the $500 cost advance, which Mr. Tichy paid. In October 2007, Client B hired another lawyer to handle his legal dispute. Matter No. 3: In 2008, Mr. Tichy sold a mobile home for $40,000 on behalf of Clients C and D. On June 5, 2008, Mr. Tichy deposited $39,750 of a $40,000 check for the mobile home sale proceeds to his trust account, taking the remaining $250 as cash. Mr. Tichy subsequently converted all the remaining sale proceeds to his own use, paying none of the proceeds to or for the benefit of Clients C and D.Non-cooperation: In March 2008, Client B filed a grievance with the Bar Association against Mr. Tichy. Mr. Tichy did not provide a timely response to the grievance. On May 29, 2008, Mr. Tichy was served with a subpoena duces tecum by the Bar Association requiring him to appear for a deposition and produce his complete client file and all financial records related to his representation of Client B. Mr. Tichy appeared, but did not produce any financial records. The deposition was continued to August 7, 2008, for the production of the subpoenaed financial records. Mr. Tichy failed to appear at the August deposition or provide the requested records. In May 2008, Client A filed a grievance with the Bar Association against Mr. Tichy. Disciplinary counsel hand-delivered to him a copy of Client Aâ€™s grievance and a letter requesting a response to the grievance. Mr. Tichy never provided a response and failed to appear at an October 2008 deposition regarding Client Aâ€™s grievance. Mr. Tichy stopped communicating with the Bar Association after August 26, 2008. Practice of Law While Suspended: Despite having requested and received more than one extension, Mr. Tichy did not complete and report his required 2004â€“2006 MCLE credits. The Washington State Supreme Court suspended Mr. Tichy from the practice of law, effective March 5, 2008. The Association notified Mr. Tichy of his suspension by letter, which was returned unclaimed. On March 6, 2008, Mr. Tichy sent a letter to an insurance company indicating that he was representing a client in a matter involving the company. A representative of the insurance company informed Mr. Tichy that he was suspended from the practice of law. In May 2008, Mr. Tichy filed a civil complaint in Spokane Superior Court on behalf of another client. In June 2008, Mr. Tichy was informed by disciplinary counsel that he was suspended from the practice of law and given a copy of the Supreme Courtâ€™s order suspending him. In September 2008, Mr. Tichy spoke to opposing counsel in the previously mentioned Spokane Superior Court civil matter about his pending summary judgment motion. In November 2008, the Bar Association opened a grievance in its own name against Mr. Tichy and sent him several letters requesting a response to the grievance. Mr. Tichy never responded to the grievance. Mr. Tichyâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.15A(b), prohibiting a lawyer from using, converting, borrowing, or pledging client or third-person property for the lawyerâ€™s own use; RPC 1.15A(c), requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients and third persons separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property; RPC 5.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in the practice of law while suspended from the practice of law for any cause; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act [here, theft] that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any unjustified act of assault or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; RPC 8.4(j), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order directing him or her to do or cease doing an act which he or she ought in good faith to do or forbear; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Christine Gray represented the Bar Association.

This discipline was based on conduct in two matters involving lack of competent representation, failing to act with reasonable diligence, and failure to communicate.Matter No. 1: In 2001, Mr. Nuamah represented a client seeking asylum in the United States. Based on erroneous advice he had previously received from a non-lawyer legal representative, Client A failed to timely seek asylum status. Although Mr. Nuamah was aware that Client A had acted on the erroneous advice, he failed to advise Client A to raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel to excuse the untimeliness of his asylum application. After his application for asylum was denied, Client A subsequently dismissed Mr. Nuamah and hired a new attorney, who successfully argued Client Aâ€™s matter based on ineffective assistance of counsel.Matter No. 2: In 2003, Mr. Nuamah undertook the representation of Client B, whose asylum application was not timely filed due to inadequate advice of a previous lawyer. Although Mr. Nuamah was aware of the circumstances, he did not advise Client B to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. When the matter came on for hearing, Mr. Nuamah did not prepare Client B to testify regarding the former counsel. When the immigration judge indicated he was denying the asylum request, he inquired whether Client B would consent to waiving the right to appeal. Without fully explaining to Client B the significance of such a waiver, Mr. Nuamah informed the judge that Client B had consented to waiving the right to appeal. Client B hired a new attorney, who brought a motion to reopen the matter based on ineffective assistance of counsel.Mr. Nuamahâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; and RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.Leslie C.

Reinhard G. â€œRonâ€ Wolff (WSBA No. 4146, admitted 1970), of Conway, was ordered to receive a reprimand on November 14, 2008, following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to act diligently, failure to communicate, and conflicts of interest. In April 2006, Clients hired Mr. Wolff to represent them in foreclosing on a second Deed of Trust they held on a piece of real property. The holder of the first Deed of Trust was in the process of foreclosing on its note. Mr. Wolff arranged for the sale of the Clientsâ€™ note to one of his longtime friends, who Mr. Wolff had also represented in a number of matters, for the purchase price of $15,000. Mr. Wolff drafted a new promissory note memorializing the terms of the deal between the Clients and the buyer. The new note provided that the Clients would be paid after the first Deed of Trust was foreclosed. The new note did not provide a payment due date in the event the foreclosure by the first Deed of Trust holder did not take place. Mr. Wolff neglected to explain the terms of the transaction to the Clients such that they understood that they would not be getting paid until the foreclosure by the first Deed of Trust holder took place, and that they risked receiving nothing if the foreclosure did not take place. Mr. Wolff did not consult with the Clients and fully disclose the facts relating to his relationship with, and past representation of, the buyer and the potential disadvantages of his representation of all parties, and did not get the Clientsâ€™ informed consent in writing to the conflict of interest. While the Deed of Trust and foreclosure did not in fact take place, the Clients received payment when the property was sold.Mr. Wolffâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; and former RPC 1.7, prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation will be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to another client, a third person, or the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless (1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the relationship with the other client, and (2) each client consents in writing after consultation and a full disclosure of the material facts.Debra J.

1436.html,27972,Sharon Gain,,Suspension,2/4/2010,,"Sharon Lee Gain (WSBA No. 27972, admitted 1998), of San Antonio, Texas, was suspended for two years, effective February 4, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline was based on conduct involving the filing of frivolous motions, failure to respect the rights of third persons, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and violations of court orders.Ms. Gain was one of three co-counsel representing members of two citizensâ€™ groups (groups) who were defendants in a SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) lawsuit. The defendants filed counterclaims for damages in the lawsuit. In September 1999, the plaintiffs brought a motion to compel the production of documents. The groups filed motions for a protective order and to dismiss. Both motions were denied by the trial court. The groups appealed the denial of the protective order and, in its briefing, also requested review as to whether the trial court erred in denying their motion to dismiss. The Court of Appeals concluded that the groupsâ€™ motion to dismiss was not reviewable as it was not designated in the motion for discretionary review. The groups appealed. In a published decision, the Washington State Supreme Court remanded the matter to the trial court for dismissal and for a determination of attorneysâ€™ fees. All of the groupsâ€™ counterclaims were preserved for trial. On July 19, 2002, Judge A signed an order dismissing the plaintiffsâ€™ claims with prejudice and preserving the defendantsâ€™ counterclaims for trial. Ms. Gain and her two co-counsels submitted fee petitions. Opposing counsel objected to Ms. Gainâ€™s fee petition because she did not keep contemporaneous time records, and a hearing was set for July 26. On July 26, Ms. Gain filed a document appealing from the trial courtâ€™s order dismissing the case and sought a recall of the Supreme Courtâ€™s June 13 mandate. Her co-counsel did not join in the motion. Before the hearing, Ms. Gain also faxed a motion to recuse Judge A and a motion to continue the hearing. The trial court entered an order regarding all attorneysâ€™ fees except Ms. Gainâ€™s fees, which were reserved. On July 30, 2002, Ms. Gain filed a motion for stay of all trial court proceedings and orders, which was denied. In August 2002, the clerk of the Supreme Court dismissed Ms. Gainâ€™s appeal for failure to pay the filing fee. Ms. Gainâ€™s Motion to Recall the Mandate and Motion for Stay were also denied by clerkâ€™s ruling. In September 2002, Ms. Gain filed a motion to modify the clerkâ€™s rulings, which was denied. Ms. Gain then wrote to the Supreme Court and requested that it transmit its records to the trial court for further proceedings. The clerk wrote to Ms. Gain that there was no basis for her request, and that any future requests without basis or authority would result in the imposition of sanctions. Ms. Gain faxed a letter to the Supreme Court that purported to contain authority for the transfer of the Supreme Court file to the trial court. The clerk responded that the Supreme Courtâ€™s mandate was final and that Ms. Gainâ€™s arguments were frivolous. Sanctions of $250 were assessed against Ms. Gain. In February 2003, Ms. Gain filed â€œcounterclaimsâ€ and an â€œamended complaint and/or supplemental pleadingâ€ in Superior Court and in the Supreme Court stating that her clients â€œwill request that the Supreme Court change its opinionâ€ and requesting, among other things, that the Supreme Court reverse the previous sanction ruling against her. Among those named as defendants in the pleadings were Judge A, the County, the State of Washington, and Ms. Gainâ€™s two former co-counsels and the opposing counsel in the original lawsuit. In April 2003, Superior Court Judge B entered an order striking the February 2003 pleadings in their entirety, finding that the pleadings were not well grounded in fact, and ordered CR 11 sanctions of $2,550 assessed against Ms. Gain. In March 2003, while Ms. Gainâ€™s â€œcounterclaimsâ€ and â€œamended complaint and/or supplemental proceedingâ€ were still pending, she filed a Notice of Appeal/Notice of Discretionary Review in the Supreme Court of Washington purporting to appeal, among other things, the Supreme Courtâ€™s published decision in the original lawsuit, and all previous rulings in the case. On March 5, 2003, the clerk informed Ms. Gain by letter that there was no copy of the signed order or judgment of which she sought review and that the failure to comply with the rules could result in dismissal of the matter. On March 21, 2003, Ms. Gain filed a motion to modify the clerkâ€™s ruling of March 5, 2003. That same day, the clerk responded that this motion was â€˜â€™premature, if not frivolousâ€ as the court had not yet made a ruling on her appeal. The Supreme Court dismissed the Notice of Appeal/Notice of Discretionary Review, noting that no order had been filed and that it appeared no order existed. Sanctions in the amount of $500 were ordered against Ms. Gain personally. Ms. Gainâ€™s subsequent motion to modify this ruling was denied. In May 2003, Ms. Gain filed a Petition for Extraordinary Writ and Motion for Summary Judgment in the Supreme Court. Among those named as defendants in the petition were trial court Judge A, the State of Washington, opposing counsel, and Ms. Gainâ€™s former co-counsels in the original lawsuit. The petition requested, among other things, that the Supreme Court change its published opinion in the original defamation lawsuit, dismiss the lawsuit against the petitioners (which had already been dismissed by Judge A), reverse its prior rulings on sanctions, and award compensatory and punitive damages against Judge A, the County, and the State of Washington. The Supreme Court sanctioned Ms. Gain $1,000 for this filing.In June 2003, Ms. Gain filed and served another Petition for Extraordinary Writ and Motion for Summary Judgment in the Supreme Court, adding as additional defendants, among others, the Washington State Supreme Court, the Supreme Court justices, the Supreme Court clerks, the Supreme Court commissioner, the Washington Court of Appeals Division II, and several judges. In the petition, Ms. Gain added the allegation of bad faith on the part of plaintiffâ€™s attorney and her former co-counsel â€œwith the aid of [Judge A].â€ In this petition, Ms. Gain requested much of the same relief as in the prior petition. The clerkâ€™s ruling stated â€œ[Ms. Gainâ€™s] pleadings constitute another frivolous filing in a case that has been mandatedâ€¦â€ and sanctioned Ms. Gain $2,500.In June 2003, Ms. Gain filed another â€œMotion to Recall the Supreme Courtâ€™s Mandate,â€ seeking to vacate the trial courtâ€™s orders dismissing the case against her clients and the orders awarding attorneysâ€™ fees to her former co-counsel. Ms. Gain also filed a Motion to Modify the Clerkâ€™s Rulings, arguing that the sanctions imposed against her were unconstitutional. Ms. Gain also filed a â€œMotion for Final Decisionâ€¦â€ and a motion to disqualify any person who participated in decision-making since the remand of the original suit. On June 27, 2003, the clerk wrote a letter to Ms. Gain stating that all of these motions would be considered by the Supreme Court at its September 2003 en banc conference. Ms. Gain then filed a Motion to Strike Clerkâ€™s Ruling of June 27, 2003, along with a document entitled â€œDemand for Final Decision on Petition for Extraordinary Writ/Motion for Summary Judgmentâ€¦â€ On September 4, 2003, the Supreme Court entered an order denying all of Ms. Gainâ€™s pending motions and directing the clerk to forward copies of all of Ms. Gainâ€™s pleadings, responsive pleadings, and orders to the Washington State Bar Association.Ms. Gainâ€™s conduct violated RPC 3.1, prohibiting a lawyer from bringing or defending a proceeding, or asserting or controverting an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law; former RPC 4.4, prohibiting a lawyer, in representing a client, from using means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person, or use methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of such a person; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(j), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order directing him or her to do or cease doing an act which he or she ought in good faith to do or forbear.Francesca Dâ€™Angelo represented the Bar Association.

This discipline is based on conduct involving failing to diligently represent a client and failing to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter.	On May 14, 2003, Mr. Hackett was hired by a client to enforce her interest in certain real property that the client and her deceased husband had transferred to a third party. Mr. Hackett failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain the type of instrument used for transferring the real property and whether the instrument was recorded. After incorrectly assuming that the property was transferred through a real estate contract, Mr. Hackett attempted to pursue forfeiture by filing an ineffective and deficient Notice of Forfeit and Declaration of Forfeiture. Mr. Hackett failed to respond to client inquiries regarding the status of the matter for seven months. After he eventually discovered that the property was transferred through a deed with the debt secured by a deed of trust, he failed to diligently pursue foreclosure on the property.	Mr. Hackettâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to diligently represent a client; and RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit a client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.

This discipline is based on conduct involving trust account irregularities, inadequate trust account records, and non-cooperation in a Bar Association investigation. Michael Joslin Davis is to be distinguished from Michael T. Davis, of Bellevue, and Michael A. Davis, of Scottsdale (resigned).During a random investigation of Mr. Davisâ€™s trust account, a Bar Association auditor found Mr. Davisâ€™s trust account records were incomplete. By not keeping accurate client records, deposit records, or check records, it was not possible for him to determine the ownership of all client funds in his trust account. The auditor also found that Mr. Davis was not removing his own funds from the trust account once ownership of those funds was established, and thereby commingled his funds with the client funds.In the course of investigating the issues related to his trust account, disciplinary counsel requested that Mr. Davis produce his trust account records for review. Mr. Davis did not make the records available to disciplinary counsel when requested, and only produced records after a subpoena was issued for Mr. Davis to appear with the records.Mr. Davisâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.14(a) and current RPC 1.15A(h)(1), requiring that all funds of a client paid to a lawyer be deposited into an identifiable interest-bearing trust account and that no funds belonging to the lawyer be deposited therein except as expressly permitted by rule; former RPC 1.14(b)(3) and current RPC 1.15A(h)(2) and RPC 1.15B, requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Randy V.

Brown (WSBA No. 24181, admitted 1994), of Covington, was ordered to receive two reprimands, effective June 23, 2009, following approval of a stipulation by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline is based on conduct while representing two separate clients involving failure to communicate with clients.Client A: In June 2007, Client A hired Mr. Brown to pursue an administrative proceeding to challenge his special-needs childâ€™s individual educational plan. Mr. Brown assured Client A that he would attend an August 2007 meeting with school officials to discuss an educational plan for the childâ€™s senior year, but failed to appear at the meeting. Mr. Brown then assured Client A that he would file an administrative complaint, but failed to do so. Thereafter, Mr. Brown did not timely respond to Client Aâ€™s attempts to contact him about the status of the matter.Effective December 1, 2007, Mr. Brown closed his private practice and commenced working for a public agency. In February 2008, because his childâ€™s senior year was nearly over and Client A was dissatisfied with Mr. Brownâ€™s representation, Client A requested that Mr. Brown refund the legal fees that Client A had paid him. Mr. Brown did not respond to any of Client Aâ€™s requests for a refund.Client B: In April 2007, Client B hired Mr. Brown to obtain full custody of his child. In September 2007, the court entered a final order with regard to the parenting plan and child support. Thereafter, Mr. Brown considered his representation over, but did not inform his client of that or file a formal notice of withdrawal. After closing his private practice and commencing work for a public agency on December 1, 2007, Client B informed Mr. Brown that the court had set a child support review hearing for December 2007. Mr. Brown told Client B that he had a new job, but did not inform Client B that he could no longer continue to represent him or appear for him at the December 2007 hearing. Mr. Brown did not appear at the December 2007 hearing and did not respond to Client Bâ€™s subsequent requests for an explanation. Mr. Brownâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4(a)(3), requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter; and RPC 1.4(a)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.Leslie C.

1460.html,15578,Jeffrey Poole,,Disbarment,10/16/2009,,"Jeffrey Gene Poole (WSBA No. 15578, admitted 1986), of Everett, was disbarred, effective October 16, 2009, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court. This discipline was based on conduct in three matters involving a conflict of interest, misrepresentations to a tribunal, improper ex parte communication, failure to inform the tribunal of all relevant facts during an ex parte proceeding, dishonest conduct, and non-cooperation during a Bar Association investigation. Matter No. 1: In 2003, Mr. Poole represented clients who were seeking to remove a lien filed against their residential property by former tenants. The lien holders (Mr. and Mrs. C) were in the process of dissolving their marriage. Upon agreement of all counsel, Mr. Pooleâ€™s clients posted a cash bond, which was deposited in the court registry. In September 2004, Mr. and Mrs. Câ€™s marriage was dissolved and, in their Property Settlement Agreement, each was awarded â€œone half of the net proceeds from the lawsuitâ€ involving Mr. Pooleâ€™s clients after paying â€œone half of approved combined attorney and professional fees and costs.â€ Mrs. Câ€™s attorney subsequently filed a lien against the funds in the registry of the court on Mrs. Câ€™s behalf.In April 2005, Mr. Poole entered into an agreement on behalf of his clients with Mr. C, who was pro se at that time, in the form of a written stipulation under which Mr. Pooleâ€™s clients agreed to dismiss Mr. C from their lawsuit in exchange for a $10,000 payment to Mr. C from the funds in the court registry. Neither Mrs. C nor her attorney (Attorney B) knew of this agreement. On Friday, April 29, 2005, Mr. Poole left a voicemail message and signed a letter to Attorney B regarding the settlement and Pooleâ€™s intention to appear ex parte on May 2, 2005, to present an Order. He then faxed Attorney B a fax cover sheet referring to an attached letter. On Saturday, April 30, Attorney B retrieved Mr. Pooleâ€™s voicemail message, but only received the fax cover sheet without the letter. That same day, Attorney B faxed a letter to Mr. Poole stating that he did not receive anything more than the fax cover page and objecting to the settlement. The fax did not go through on April 30, but was completed May 2. Mr. Poole received Attorney Bâ€™s fax and saw that Attorney B had received only the fax cover page. Approximately one hour before the hearing, Mr. Poole faxed Attorney B a copy of his letter. Attorney B had already left his office that day for a hearing in another matter.Mr. Poole went to the courtâ€™s Ex Parte Department and presented the Order. When questioned by the court, Mr. Poole misrepresented that Attorney B had been adequately notified. Mr. Poole failed to inform the court that Attorney B had an objection to the Stipulation. Based on those misrepresentations and omissions, the court granted Mr. Pooleâ€™s request and signed the Order. Later that month, with notice to Attorney B, Mr. Poole moved in the Court of Appeals to have Mr. C dismissed from the litigation. Attorney B filed an objection to the motion to dismiss, asserting that Mr. Poole had not provided notice to him of the ex parte application for an order disbursing funds from the court registry. In a memorandum and a declaration dated May 25, 2005, Mr. Poole misrepresented to the Court of Appeals the dates that a letter giving Attorney B notice of the ex parte appearance was in fact faxed to him. Matter No. 2: In December 2003, Mr. Poole filed a lawsuit in district court against a former client (Mr. M) to collect attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. Mr. M initially filed a notice of appearance on behalf of himself and his wife. By early April 2004, Attorney C was assisting Mr. M. Attorney C did not formally appear until June 10, 2004, but Mr. Poole served Attorney C with documents prior to that date. On June 2, 2004, Mr. Poole appeared in district court for the trial. Neither Attorney C nor Mr. M appeared for trial. After the conclusion of the court proceedings, Mr. Poole sent the judge a letter with a proposed Judgment, which the judge subsequently signed. He did not send copies to Mr. M or Attorney C, who had not yet formally appeared. On June 3, 2004, Attorney C communicated a settlement offer to Mr. Poole. Mr. Poole informed Attorney C that he was not interested in settlement because the court had already awarded a judgment. On June 4, 2004, Attorney C visited the district court, discovered the clerk had not sent Mr. M notice of the trial date, and then advised Mr. Poole that he would be moving to â€œset aside what happened June 2â€¦.â€ On January 4, 2005, Mr. Poole, Mr. M, and Attorney C appeared in superior court for supplemental proceeding so that Mr. Poole could gather additional information from Mr. M to assist him in collection of the judgment. Instead of submitting to an examination, Mr. M agreed to pay the amount of the judgment into the court registry on the understanding that the funds would remain in the registry until the dispute over the judgmentâ€™s validity was resolved. Minutes before the commencement of the supplemental proceedings calendar, Attorney C filed a motion for an order vacating the judgment, quashing the supplemental proceedings, and terminating and enjoining further collection action by Mr. Poole. The judge declined to consider the motion, as it had not been properly noted. Before leaving the courthouse, Attorney C deposited, on behalf of his client, $11,941.01 in the registry of the court. By letter dated January 5, 2005, Attorney C informed Mr. Poole that he would be amending the motion filed on January 4, 2005, and requested that Mr. Poole serve notice on him of any further actions taken in the matter. Mr. Poole received and responded to Attorney Câ€™s letter that same day. On January 7, 2005, Mr. Poole filed an ex parte motion for an order disbursing to himself $11,460.27 of the funds Mr. M had placed in the court registry. Mr. Poole did not provide Attorney C or Mr. M with a copy of this motion prior to going to court, and did not notify them of his intention to seek such an order. In his ex parte motion, Mr. Poole stated that on January 4, 2005, Mr. M â€œand his counsel agreed to pay the judgment into the court registry.â€ The motion did not inform the court that they did so on the understanding that the funds would remain in the court registry until the validity of the judgment was resolved, or that Attorney C still intended to pursue the issue of the validity of the judgment. Mr. Poole presented the ex parte motion to the supplemental proceedings judge, who granted it. Mr. Poole received $11,460.27 disbursed from the court registry.On January 11, 2005, Attorney C filed in superior court a Motion to Set Aside and Vacate Judgment and requested a court order refunding the $11,941.01 to Mr. M, which he believed was still in the courtâ€™s registry. In his response, Mr. Poole asserted, â€œ[O]n January 4, 2005, [Mr. M] deposited funds sufficient to pay the judgment in full into the registry of the court without reservation and did not designate the funds as a supersedeas bond to stay collection.â€ The superior court denied Attorney Câ€™s motion, without prejudice to the motion being brought in district court. Subsequently, Attorney C amended the motion and filed it in district court. Mr. Poole filed a response stating that Mr. M had received notice of all actions. On April 21, 2005, the district court heard argument from Attorney C and Mr. Poole on the pending motion to vacate. The district court judge vacated the June 6, 2004, judgment, but allowed Mr. Poole to retain possession of the funds pending the resolution of the lawsuit through a bench trial. At the bench trial, held on September 16, 2005, the court ruled in Mr. Pooleâ€™s favor, indicating the funds previously collected remained his, but did not make an award of any additional costs or fees because â€œit was the Courtâ€™s error [in failing to send Mr. M notice of the original trial date which necessitated this last hearing.]â€Matter No. 3: In early August 2004, Mr. Poole began representing Mr. K. Mr. K owned valuable commercial real estate and generated his living expenses by refinancing his properties. Mr. K was also the sole owner and member of a limited liability company (LLC), which owned two parcels of property. At the beginning of the representation, Mr. Poole advised Mr. K that he must provide security for payment of Pooleâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. Between August 2004 and January 2006, Mr. Poole provided representation to Mr. K in multiple lawsuits; he also served as manager of certain limited liability companies owned by Mr. K. On October 15, 2004, Mr. K signed a written fee agreement with Mr. Poole providing for payment of fees at certain hourly rates and security for payment of fees and costs, with the amount and terms of security not agreed to at that time. Between October 19, 2004, and December 22, 2004, Mr. Poole sent regular billing statements to Mr. K, which grew to a balance of $116,892.44 by December 22, 2004. On multiple occasions, Mr. Poole communicated his interest in obtaining payment from Mr. K by re-financing one or more of Mr. Kâ€™s properties. He repeatedly suggested that Mr. K consult with independent legal counsel regarding this arrangement.On January 4, 2005, Mr. Poole prepared and delivered to Mr. K a letter that Mr. Poole called a Security Agreement. The Security Agreement set forth the understanding that Mr. K would â€œprovide a note for $200,000.00 on each of the [two properties owned by LLC]â€ and â€œexecute an irrevocable escrow instructionâ€ that Mr. Pooleâ€™s firm would be paid the net proceeds from any loan on Mr. Kâ€™s property after payment of certain amounts. Mr. Poole also advised Mr. K to consult with independent legal counsel before signing the Security Agreement, the notes, the deeds of trust, and the irrevocable escrow instruction. Mr. K signed the Security Agreement on January 5, 2005. After the Security Agreement was signed, Mr. Poole prepared a Promissory Note in the amount of $200,000 â€œor the full balance owed under the Security Agreement signed on January 4, 2005,â€ and had Mr. K sign the Promissory Note, as the sole member of LLC and personally. In February and March 2005, Mr. Poole served as legal counsel for Mr. K and manager of LLC to arrange for a $335,000 loan from Corporation W to LLC, secured by the two parcels of property. The net proceeds of the loan to the borrower were to be approximately $118,000. At the time, Mr. Poole intended that approximately $95,000 of the net proceeds of the loan would be used to pay his outstanding attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, and that an additional amount would be used to reimburse Mr. Poole for $10,000 he had advanced to Mr. K for living expenses. Mr. Poole intended to have Mr. K grant him a deed of trust on the property after the loan closed, so that Mr. Pooleâ€™s deed of trust would be subordinate to Corporation Wâ€™s deed of trust on the property. Mr. Poole did not advise Mr. K of any actual or potential conflict of interest nor explain any risks or possible implications in his representation of Mr. K in obtaining a loan from Corporation W, secured by the LLC property, even though Mr. Poole had a personal financial interest in the loan and the property. Mr. Poole did not obtain consent in writing from Mr. K to the potential or actual conflict of interest.As of March 21, 2005, in order to secure payment of his attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, Mr. Poole prepared two Deeds of Trust, one on each property owned by LLC. Each Deed of Trust was in the amount of $200,000 and Mr. Poole was the beneficiary of each. On March 21, 2005, Mr. K signed both Deeds of Trust. The loan from Corporation W was finalized and Mr. Poole received and deposited $118,371.83 net proceeds into his trust account. Between March 25, 2005, and April 18, 2005, Mr. Poole transferred more than $94,000 of the loan funds to his firm for payment of invoiced fees and costs and more than $14,000 of the loan funds for reimbursement of advances made to Mr. K. On March 29, 2005, Mr. Poole recorded the two Deeds of Trust naming himself as grantee (beneficiary). Monthly payments on the loan were due beginning May 1, 2005. Mr. K, who had no regular income and no liquid assets, had no ready means for making the monthly payments on the loan. He was not assured enough time to refinance another property in order to make his monthly payments on the loan to avoid foreclosure.In November 2005, Mr. K signed a purchase and sale agreement under which LLC agreed to sell one of its parcels of property for $500,000. At that time, Mr. Poole was claiming a right to payment of approximately $187,000 from any sale of LLC property on which Mr. Poole had a Deed of Trust. Mr. Poole withdrew from any and all legal representation of Mr. K and his business entities in December 2005. On January 5, 2006, the Washington State Supreme Court ordered that Mr. Poole be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months. In January 2006, Mr. K and the buyer of the LLC property entered into a written Addendum to the Purchase and Sale Agreement of the property. The Addendum provided for wrap-around arrangement under which Mr. Poole would receive no funds on the closing of the sale. Instead, the buyer would sign a promissory note in the amount of $360,000 secured by a Deed of Trust that would â€œwrapâ€ around the â€œexisting Deed of Trust in favor of Jeffery [sic] Poole.â€ Mr. K would receive payments on the promissory note with the final cash out occurring on January 31, 2007. This arrangement provided Mr. K with time to reach an agreement regarding the payoff of Note, Deeds of Trust, and any other outstanding claims with Mr. Poole.Non-cooperation: Between June 2005 and July 2007, Mr. Poole failed to cooperate with the Bar Associationâ€™s investigation of five grievances filed against him. Mr. Pooleâ€™s non-cooperation included failing to respond in a timely fashion, despite multiple reminders, to grievances and to requests for additional information. Mr. Poole also failed to appear for a deposition and to produce all documents set forth in subpoenas issued during the investigation of one of the grievances. Mr. Poole made misrepresentations to the Bar Association in three of the grievances and a misrepresentation in a declaration sent to the Supreme Court regarding one of the grievances. Mr. Pooleâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if a conflict of interest exists; RPC 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from making a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal; RPC 3.3(f), requiring a lawyer, in an ex parte proceeding, to inform the tribunal of all material facts known to the lawyer that will enable the tribunal to make an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse; RPC 3.5(b), prohibiting a lawyer from communicating ex parte with a judge except as permitted by law; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter; and RPC 8.4(n), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law.Christine Gray and Kathleen A.T.

1461.html,16532,Rosemary Kamb,,Suspension,3/9/2010,,"Rosemary Kamb (WSBA No. 16532, admitted 1986), of Mount Vernon, was suspended for one year, effective March 9, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of stipulation. This discipline was based on conduct in two matters involving trust account irregularities, charging unreasonable fees, representing a person without the authority of that person, making false statements to a tribunal, engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and failing to communicate and explain billing procedures.Matter No. 1: In June 2004, Ms. Kamb was hired by Clients S and L to file a guardianship action to protect their mother because of concerns they had about the care provided by their stepfather. On June 24, 2004, a guardian ad litem (GAL) was appointed. The GAL submitted a report in early September recommending the appointment of the stepfather as guardian and a hearing was set for later in the month.On September 16, 2004, the mother died, making the guardianship action moot. Clients S and L then hired Ms. Kamb to probate their motherâ€™s estate. A petition to probate the motherâ€™s estate was filed in October 2004. The motherâ€™s will named Client S and the stepfather as co-personal representatives. Since both were adversaries in the prior guardianship, the court did not initially enter an order appointing a personal representative for the motherâ€™s estate, but instead appointed a temporary personal representative.On October 8, 2004, Client S gave Ms. Kamb a Social Security check issued to her mother, which Ms. Kamb deposited into her IOLTA account. Ten days later, Ms. Kamb withdrew the sum from her IOLTA account without the knowledge or authority of clients S or L and deposited it into her general account. On November 15, 2004, Client S gave Ms. Kamb money that she found among her motherâ€™s possessions to hold for the estate. The money was deposited into Ms. Kambâ€™s IOLTA account. The following year, Ms. Kamb withdrew the money from her IOLTA account without the knowledge or authority of Clients S and L and deposited it into her general account.In the guardianship matter, Ms. Kamb agreed to an order to pay the GAL her fees. In December 2004, Ms. Kamb and the GAL had a dispute over whether the fees would be paid out of a blocked account. The GAL made a motion in the probate proceeding for payment of her fees from the blocked account. Ms. Kamb filed an objection to the request. The GAL filed a declaration in response. In January 2005, the court granted the fees requested by the GAL. On February 18, 2005, Ms. Kamb filed a motion to strike the GALâ€™s declaration as untimely, as it had been filed the day before the hearing. The motion was set for early March and eventually scheduled to be heard on April 1, 2005. Clients S and L terminated Ms. Kamb prior to the April 1 hearing and hired new counsel. Ms. Kamb signed a Notice of Withdrawal and Substitution, effective March 28, 2005, and acknowledged new substitute counsel. Prior to the April 1, 2005, hearing, new counsel sent a letter to the court, the GAL, and the parties informing them that he was withdrawing Ms. Kambâ€™s motion to strike. Ms. Kamb disputes whether she received the letter but was aware prior to the April 2005 hearing that new counsel sought to cancel the hearing.On April 1, 2005, Ms. Kamb appeared in court for the motion hearing even though she no longer represented any parties in the estate matter. She presented an order granting the motion to strike the GALâ€™s declaration and signed it as â€œattorney for the estate.â€ The court signed the order.In February 2005, Ms. Kamb presented Client S with two bills, one for the guardianship and one for the probate. She had not provided the clients with an accounting or bill for her services until then. Among the unreasonable fees charged in the matter, Ms. Kamb charged for time spent by staff performing clerical tasks at paralegal rates, charged for publication of notice to creditors even though the notice was never sent in for publishing, charged 7.5 hours for objecting to the GALâ€™s motion for payment from the blocked account, and charged for the expense of copying the file after she had been terminated.On October 6, 2005, the probate was resolved and the court ruled that each party would be responsible for its own attorney fees. On October 11, 2005, Ms. Kamb filed a motion to pay attorney fees from the probate estate. Client S filed a response objecting to Ms. Kambâ€™s fees. On October 19, 2005, the court entered a final order that each party must pay their own attorney fees and costs. The issue regarding attorney fees was never resolved.Matter No. 2: In 2000, Ms. Kamb was hired by a client to perform estate planning services. In June 2000, the client executed a revocable living trust prepared by Ms. Kamb that named the clientâ€™s son R as co-trustee of the trust. On April 24, 2006, the client hired Ms. Kamb to amend the trust naming her other son M as co-trustee instead of Son R. The client agreed to pay a flat fee to prepare the amended trust. Two days later, the client hired Ms. Kamb to assist her in the recovery of funds being held by a financial services company. Ms. Kamb charged the client a $200 hourly fee. The fee agreement did not specify the client would be charged for clerical work.In May 2006, Son R filed a petition seeking limited guardianship for his mother. The court appointed a GAL. After Ms. Kamb learned a GAL was appointed, she advised Son M that he could remove his mother from his home. Subsequently, the mother moved out and avoided service so that the GALâ€™s access to her was delayed. The GAL was eventually able to interview the mother. On June 29, 2006, before the guardianship could be established, the mother was found dead on an isolated beach. In October 2006, Ms. Kamb requested that the court order her fees to be paid from the motherâ€™s estate. Ms. Kamb submitted an affidavit with a billing statement charging $1,995 for preparation of the amended trust package. The fees sought were unreasonable in that Ms. Kamb included an additional $400 consultation fee, a $100 expedite fee, and failed to credit at least $400 received from the client. Ms. Kamb attached a second bill of $9,942.53 for legal services relating to her attempts to recover the clientâ€™s property. Among the unreasonable charges were charges for clerical tasks performed by staff, charges for non-legal services, and charges for services performed after she was terminated. The court denied her request for fees because it had no authority to award fees to her when she did not represent the client in the guardianship. In December 2006, Ms. Kamb filed two creditorâ€™s claims in the probate of the motherâ€™s estate. The claims were the same two bills previously submitted to the court as exhibits to her affidavit.Ms. Kambâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.2(f), prohibiting a lawyer from acting as a lawyer for a person without the authority of the person; former RPC 1.4(a) and (b), requiring the lawyer to keep clients reasonably informed of a matter and to explain matters to the extent reasonably necessary; former RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fees to be reasonable; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring client funds paid to the lawyer to be deposited into a trust account; former RPC 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from making false statements to the tribunal; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.Francesca Dâ€™Angelo represented the Bar Association.

1465.html,25103,Paul Lehto,,Disbarment,3/24/2010,,"Paul Richard Lehto (WSBA No. 25103, admitted 1995), of Ishpeming, Michigan, formerly of Snohomish County, was disbarred, effective March 24, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions, lack of diligence, failure to communicate, trust account irregularities, failure to maintain records of client funds, improper withdrawal from representation, failure to respect rights of third party, commission of a criminal act, dishonest conduct, violation of attorneyâ€™s oath, non-cooperation in discipline investigations, and unfitness to practice law.Matter No. 1: In August 2000, Clients A hired Attorney B to represent them in the lawsuit. Attorney B withdrew from the representation in March 2002 and Mr. Lehto appeared in July 2003. Mr. Lehto continued to represent Clients A through the dismissal of the lawsuit in February 2006. Attorney B claimed that, as of June 2004, Clients A owed him legal fees and costs of $24,369.04. He sent one or more letters to Mr. Lehto regarding their outstanding bill, but Mr. Lehto did not respond. Attorney B informed Mr. Lehto and Clients A that he was willing to accept $17,500 as full payment of the outstanding bill. In August 2005, Clients A issued a check to Mr. Lehto in the amount of $17,500 to pay Attorney B. Mr. Lehto told them he would take care of the matter. Mr. Lehto did not deposit the clientsâ€™ check into a trust account or disburse any funds to Attorney B. Instead, Mr. Lehto deposited the check into his business account and used the funds to pay his own personal and business expenses. In February 2006, Attorney B filed a lawsuit against Clients A for the outstanding legal fees and costs. Without informing them, Mr. Lehto filed a Notice of Appearance on behalf of Clients A to appear as their counsel in Attorney Bâ€™s lawsuit. Mr. Lehto did not file an Answer to Attorney Bâ€™s lawsuit. Attorney B filed a Motion for Order of Default, which was noted for a July 12, 2006, hearing. Mr. Lehto failed to inform Clients A about the Motion for Order of Default, failed to respond to the Motion, and failed to appear at the July 2006 hearing. On July 12, 2006, the court entered an Order of Default against Clients A. In August 2006, Attorney B filed a Motion for Final Default Judgment, which was noted for a September 13, 2006, hearing. Mr. Lehto failed to inform Clients A about the Motion for Final Default Judgment, failed to respond to the Motion, and failed to appear at the September 2006 hearing. On September 13, 2006, the court entered a Default Judgment Order against Clients A in the amount of $27,180.36. Mr. Lehto did not inform Clients A about the Default Judgment Order.In December 2006, after Clients A learned of the default judgment while trying to buy a house, they went to Mr. Lehtoâ€™s last known office address. Mr. Lehto was no longer there. Clients A contacted Mr. Lehto by telephone. Mr. Lehto promised to have Attorney Bâ€™s judgment vacated, but failed to take steps to do so. Clients A tried to contact Mr. Lehto again by telephone and by e-mail, but Mr. Lehto did not respond. In September 2007, Clients A paid Attorney B $7,500, which he accepted in full satisfaction of his judgment. Mr. Lehto did not refund Clients Aâ€™s $17,500 or provide to them an accounting of the funds. Matter No. 2: In 2002, Mr. Lehto contacted a nonprofit auto safety and consumer advocacy organization (CARS Foundation) on behalf of Client B. Mr. Lehto asked the CARS Foundation to loan Client B funds to obtain safe, reliable transportation pending resolution of Client Bâ€™s lawsuit against a car dealership. The CARS Foundation agreed to loan Client B $3,500, provided Client B repay the entire amount of the loan plus 10 percent simple interest out of any settlement received before Client B, his attorney, or others were paid, within one year after the case settled. Client B signed the loan agreement. The loan agreement also contained a statement, which was signed by Mr. Lehto, in which Mr. Lehto agreed that the CARS Foundation would be reimbursed from any settlement prior to the release of any other funds. Client Bâ€™s case settled in December 2005. In February 2006, Mr. Lehto received a settlement check in the amount of $48,885, which he subsequently deposited into his trust account. In March 2006, Mr. Lehto transferred $20,000 from his trust account into his business account and disbursed $16,954.84 from his trust account to Client B. Mr. Lehto sent an e-mail to the CARS Foundation president stating, â€œI can cut a check as soon as I am provided a figure.â€ The Foundation president sent Mr. Lehto an e-mail stating the amount owed on Client Bâ€™s loan. Mr. Lehto did not send a check or any other payment to the CARS Foundation. In June 2006, Mr. Lehto sent an e-mail to the CARS Foundation stating that he would send a check within a day or so, but he failed to do so. For 17 months, Mr. Lehto did not respond to letters or telephone messages from the CARS Foundation demanding repayment of Client Bâ€™s loan. In February 2007, Mr. Lehto called the CARS Foundation and asked how much Client B owed. The Foundation president sent Mr. Lehto an e-mail stating that the amount owed was $4,966. Mr. Lehto did not send a check or any other payment to the CARS Foundation. In May 2007, the Foundation president sent Mr. Lehto an e-mail stating, â€œI havenâ€™t heard back from you since then [February]. What is happening?â€ Mr. Lehto responded by e-mail, â€œYour money is there so I asked for checks to be fedexed here so I can cut a check.â€ A few minutes later that same day, Mr. Lehto sent another e-mail stating, â€œI donâ€™t believe that there is [sic] any funds for interest from my client or from me . . . . So, what will likely happen is that I can send you a check for the original amount at end of loan without interest. The interest on the funds went to legal services for the indigent in Wash. State.â€ Mr. Lehtoâ€™s May 2007 e-mail was his last communication with the CARS Foundation. He did not send a check or any other payment to the CARS Foundation.Failure to Cooperate: In May 2006, the Association received two Trust Account Overdraft Notices (TAONs) regarding Mr. Lehtoâ€™s trust account. Mr. Lehto failed to respond to the Associationâ€™s requests for information regarding the trust account, failed to produce records in response to the Associationâ€™s subpoena duces tecum, and failed to appear for a deposition that was originally scheduled for September 2006 and then continued to November 2006 at Mr. Lehtoâ€™s request.On December 1, 2006, the president of the CARS Foundation filed a grievance against Mr. Lehto with the Association. Mr. Lehto failed to respond to the grievance, failed to produce records in response to the Associationâ€™s subpoena duces tecum, and failed to appear for a deposition scheduled for May 2007.Mr. Lehtoâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions about the objectives of representation and to consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring that a lawyer keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein; former RPC 1.14(b)(3) and current RPC 1.15A(e), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; former RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to pay or promptly deliver to the client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive; former RPC 1.15(d) and current RPC 1.15A(f) and 1.16(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests upon termination of representation, including giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned; RPC 4.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer, in representing a client, from using a means that has no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects (here, theft); RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; RPC 8.4(k), prohibiting a lawyer from violating his or her oath as an attorney; RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter; and RPC 8.4(n), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law.Marsha A.

1466.html,18311,David Hellenthal,,Disbarment,3/24/2010,,"David R. Hellenthal (WSBA No. 18311, admitted 1988), of Spokane, was disbarred by order of the Washington State Supreme Court, effective March 24, 2010, following a default hearing. This discipline was based on conduct in four matters involving lack of diligence, failure to communicate, trust account irregularities, failure to protect clientsâ€™ interests, commission of a criminal act, violation of a court order, and violations of duties imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct.Matter No. 1: Two sisters hired Mr. Hellenthal on September 4, 2007, to set up a co-guardianship for their mother. One sister (â€œClient Aâ€) paid Mr. Hellenthal $1,200, in two checks: a $200 check for filing fees and a $1,000 check, which was an advance fee payment. Unbeknownst to the clients, the Supreme Court suspended Mr. Hellenthal from the practice of law for 18 months, effective September 6, 2007. Client A learned of the suspension after reading a newspaper article and contacted Mr. Hellenthal to request a refund and return of her file. He told her that he was unable to do either, although he did return the file about a month later. The file contained notes of their initial meeting and a few pleadings, none of which had been filed with the court. Mr. Hellenthal claimed he had earned the fee, but produced no documents to verify the amount of time spent on the case or that the $1,000 fee was earned. In addition, a Montana lawyer with whom Mr. Hellenthal claims he spoke denied that he spoke to Mr. Hellenthal. Mr. Hellenthal negotiated both the checks and did not deposit the $1,000 check for advance fees into his trust account. He deposited the $200 check into his trust account, but did not maintain the funds there. On September 6, 2007, Mr. Hellenthal depleted and overdrew the trust account, which remained overdrawn until its closure in October 2007.Matter No. 2: In May 2007, Client B consulted with Mr. Hellenthal about selling her deceased brotherâ€™s house and getting her mother on Medicaid. Another lawyer had already handled the probate, appointed a personal representative, and filed nearly all the necessary paperwork to close the deceased brotherâ€™s estate. Client B paid Mr. Hellenthal a total of $4,500, which Mr. Hellenthal failed to deposit into his trust account. In August 2007, Mr. Hellenthal had Client B sign some papers with respect to her brotherâ€™s estate, but did not file any of the papers with the court. Mr. Hellenthal did not inform Client B of his September 6, 2007, suspension. She learned of it after reading a newspaper article on September 13, 2007, and contacted Mr. Hellenthal to ask about the status of her brotherâ€™s estate. Mr. Hellenthal told her that he had not filed the papers and would get back to her. Mr. Hellenthal left a message on Client Bâ€™s answering machine in November 2007 stating that he had a strategy for completing the work without his being an attorney. Client B called him back and asked for a refund. Mr. Hellenthal said he did not have the money and never gave Client B the papers she signed. Client B paid other lawyers a total of $1,600 to complete work for which she had paid Mr. Hellenthal $4,500. Matter No. 3: Client C, who had a power of attorney for her mother, hired Mr. Hellenthal to appeal a Social Security decision regarding overpayment of her motherâ€™s monthly benefits and to have Medicaid recalculate the amount of co-payments made to the nursing home in which her mother resided. Client C paid Mr. Hellenthal $2,187.50 to handle her motherâ€™s legal matters. Mr. Hellenthal properly appealed the overpayment determination made by Social Security and asked Medicaid to recalculate their co-payments. The Social Security benefits were reinstated from March 2007 forward pending the outcome of the appeal. A telephonic hearing on the issue of calculation of the Medicaid benefits was set for March 12, 2007. Mr. Hellenthal did not appear at the hearing. The administrative law judge (ALJ) left a message for Mr. Hellenthal the day of the hearing. When Mr. Hellenthal did not return the call by the end of the day, the ALJ entered a default and dismissed the appeal. Mr. Hellenthal did not tell Client C that he had not attended the hearing or that the appeal had been dismissed, and he did not request that the dismissal be vacated. In May 2007, Mr. Hellenthal instructed Client C to pay her motherâ€™s nursing home $4,738.01, an amount charged to Client Câ€™s mother due to the problem with the Medicaid co-payments. Client C paid this sum from her motherâ€™s supplemental needs trust, thinking they were still waiting for a decision on the appeal. Mr. Hellenthal did not inform Client C or her mother of his September 6, 2007, suspension. In late September 2007, Client C tried to reach Mr. Hellenthal, but his phone was disconnected. Shortly thereafter, another lawyer advised Client C of Mr. Hellenthalâ€™s suspension. She hired a new lawyer to look into the appeal that Mr. Hellenthal was handling, and he discovered it had been dismissed. In October 2007, Client C picked up her client file at Mr. Hellenthalâ€™s home, during which time Mr. Hellenthal told her that it was his â€œstrategyâ€ not to attend the March 12, 2007, hearing. Client Câ€™s new lawyer subsequently filed a motion to vacate the dismissal based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Client Câ€™s mother died shortly thereafter and, because her estate was not probated, the issue was never resolved. Had the appeal been successful, Medicaid would have paid the nursing home the $4,738.01 that Mr. Hellenthal instructed Client C to pay from her motherâ€™s supplemental needs trust.Matter No. 4: In May 1998, Ms. D amended her Living Trust Agreement to name Mr. Hellenthal and Mr. E as co-successor trustees. She specified that they must reach a consensus before taking any action in relation to the trust, including disbursements of trust assets. Ms. D died in April 2007, and Mr. E and Mr. Hellenthal became co-trustees for the trust. Mr. E opened a bank account in the name of Ms. Dâ€™s trust. Before Mr. Hellenthal became an authorized signer on the account, he billed the trust for administrative fees through Mr. E. Between December 2007 and May 2008, Mr. Hellenthal made several urgent requests for payment, often demanding advance payments. During this period, Mr. Hellenthal was paid approximately $10,000 in administration fees. By mid-April 2008, Mr. Hellenthal had added himself to the trustâ€™s account. Between May 2008 and August 2008, without the knowledge or approval of Mr. E, Mr. Hellenthal made 17 withdrawals from the account totaling $25,000 using counter checks. Many of the checks were made payable to himself or â€œCashâ€ and contained a statement on the memo line that they were for a â€œTrustee Advance.â€ Mr. Hellenthal had no entitlement to the funds he withdrew and has not accounted for them. In August 2008, Mr. E closed the account and moved the remaining funds into an account to which Mr. Hellenthal did not have access. In September 2008, Mr. Hellenthal cashed a $2,000 check, even though the account had been closed. Following a petition by Mr. E, the superior court removed Mr. Hellenthal as co-trustee of Ms. Dâ€™s trust and ordered him to repay the trust $27,000, disgorge all fees he received for his services to the trust, pay attorney fees and costs, and submit to Mr. E all documentation relating to the trust in his possession. Mr. Hellenthal has neither complied with the court order, nor cooperated in a subsequent investigation by the Bar Association.Mr. Hellenthalâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to promptly inform the client of any decision of circumstance with respect to which the clientâ€™s informed consent is required by these Rules, reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the clientâ€™s objectives are to be accomplished, keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyerâ€™s conduct, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses; RPC 1.15A(h), prohibiting a lawyer from depositing or retaining funds belonging to the lawyer in a trust account except for funds to pay bank charges, funds belonging in part to a client or third person and in part to the lawyer, and funds necessary to restore appropriate balances; RPC 1.16(d), requiring a lawyer, upon termination of representation, to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; RPC 8.4(j), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order directing him or her to do or cease doing an act which he or she ought in good faith to do or forbear; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Joanne S.

1467.html,6479,Patrick Mullen,,Resignation in Lieu of Disbarment,3/18/2010,,"Patrick J. Mullen (WSBA No. 6479, admitted 1976), of Lynnwood, resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective March 18, 2010. This resignation was based on conduct involving failure to communicate, trust account irregularities, and dishonesty.In July 2006, a client hired Mr. Mullen to represent him in a child custody matter. The clientâ€™s former partner planned to move to another state with their three children. On July 11, 2006, the client signed a fee agreement with Mr. Mullen. The client paid Mr. Mullen $600 by check as an â€œinitial fee deposit.â€ On August 2, 2006, Mr. Mullen asked the client for $5,000 more in the form of a cash deposit to his general business account. The client made the deposit as requested. Mr. Mullen never appeared or filed anything for the client. By August 11, 2006, the court had entered orders granting relocation as requested by the clientâ€™s former partner. On August 14, 2006, Mr. Mullen told the client that he needed to file paperwork in superior court and asked for $750 more. The client deposited that sum to Mr. Mullenâ€™s personal checking account as instructed. Mr. Mullen told the client that he would credit him for $1,500 in legal fees for his $750. Mr. Mullen did not put any of the clientâ€™s funds into his trust account or provide the client a receipt for any of his payments. Mr. Mullen did not send the client any invoices to document how he earned or spent any of the money and never provided a written status report. After one year of many failed attempts to get a status report, the client terminated Mr. Mullen. Mr. Mullen agreed to refund the unearned portion of the fees paid by the client, which he calculated as $4,190. To date, Mr. Mullen has repaid nothing. Mr. Mullen used the clientâ€™s funds for his personal expenses. Mr. Mullenâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.14, requiring that all funds paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and that no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein, that the lawyer promptly notify a client of the receipt of his or her funds, maintain the funds as set forth in the rules, and promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested the funds in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Peter S.

1469.html,21821,Clayton Longacre,,Reprimand,1/20/2010,,"Clayton E. Longacre (WSBA No. 21821, admitted 1992), of Port Orchard, was ordered by a hearing officer to receive a reprimand on January 20, 2010. This discipline was based on conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.On April 2, 2007, Mr. Longacre filed a notice of appearance in municipal court on behalf of a defendant whom he represented on a charge of driving under the influence. On July 5, 2007, Mr. Longacre appeared in court and entered a deferred prosecution on behalf of the defendant. The defendant was summoned to appear for a review hearing on October 11, 2007.

1473.html,26939,Paul Jacobson,,Reprimand,3/30/2010,,"Paul D. Jacobson (WSBA No. 26939, admitted 1997), of Redmond, was ordered to receive a reprimand plus two yearsâ€™ probation by order of the Disciplinary Board on March 30, 2010, following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct involving trust account irregularities and failure to properly supervise a non-lawyer assistant.In 2002, Mr. Jacobson opened the Jacobson Law Group, which focused primarily on providing criminal defense work as a contractor, with one associate handling a small number of general cases. Prior to opening Jacobson Law Group in 2002, Mr. Jacobsonâ€™s practice was almost exclusively criminal defense and he had little, if any, exposure to trust accounting. He delegated the IOLTA setup and operation for Jacobson Law Group to his staff. Although Mr. Jacobson signed all trust account checks, he relied upon his staff to determine what disbursements were appropriate and to draft the checks for his signature. Mr. Jacobson did not properly supervise his staff in either the setup or the operation of the IOLTA account. As a result, client ledgers were not maintained for individual client balances, and the checks drawn on the IOLTA account did not always identify the client on whose behalf the funds were being disbursed. In 2005, during the investigation of a grievance, the Bar Association opened an investigation into the adequacy of Mr. Jacobsonâ€™s trust account practices. During the period from November 2002 through October 2007, a variety of bookkeeping errors went undetected due to the lack of client ledgers and the resulting inability to incorporate a set of client ledgers into the monthly reconciliations as a means of detecting errors. These errors included errors in the disbursements to the Jacobson Law Group for fees, at times disbursing the fees before they had been fully earned, and at times failing to remove earned fees from the account. Similar errors were made in disbursements to third parties and in payment and reimbursement of costs.Over a period of years, these errors accumulated, and while the errors were serious, no client or third party complained; due to the deficiencies in the trust account records, Mr. Jacobson had no way of knowing of the errors. To ascertain that all client funds had been properly accounted for, it was necessary for the WSBA auditor to reconstruct a set of trust account records, including individual client ledgers. The auditorâ€™s reconstruction covered the period from November 19, 2002, when the account was opened, to November 30, 2009. The failure to identify each disbursement by client made this reconstruction problematic. Mr. Jacobson and his staff cooperated with the WSBA auditor in obtaining the documentation necessary to identify the clients on whose behalf disbursements had been made.Upon completion of the trust account reconstruction, it was determined that the account was short by $1,189.45, and Mr. Jacobson placed his own funds in this amount into the account to bring the account current and balanced. Mr. Jacobson also paid his own funds of $161.14 to the Legal Foundation of Washington, which represents the amount of interest that the WSBA auditor identified should have been earned had all funds been properly maintained in the trust account and had the bank properly transmitted earned interest to the Legal Foundation. In addition, the WSBA auditor assisted Mr. Jacobson and his bookkeeper in setting up a proper set of trust account records, including individual client ledgers.Mr. Jacobsonâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.14(a) and current RPC 1.15A(c), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited into one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and no funds of the lawyer be deposited therein; former RPC 1.14(b)(3) and current RPC 1.15A(h)(2), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; and RPC 5.3(b), requiring that a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over a non-lawyer make reasonable efforts to ensure that the personâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer.Randy V.

1474.html,24192,Vicky Currie,,Reprimand,3/12/2010,,"Vicky J. Currie (WSBA No. 24192, admitted 1994), of Tacoma, was ordered to receive a reprimand on March 12, 2010, following approval of a stipulation by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to diligently represent a client, failure to communicate, and unreasonable fees.On November 23, 2004, a client hired Ms. Currie to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to prevent the foreclosure of his home, which he had been notified would be sold at a foreclosure sale on December 3, 2004. The client also received notice that another property he owned, a duplex, would be sold at a foreclosure sale on February 11, 2005. The client was behind on his car payments. He told Ms. Currie that he wished to keep his vehicle. On December 2, 2004, Ms. Currie filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy on the clientâ€™s behalf. On December 15, 2004, Ford Motor Company sent Ms. Currie a letter inviting the client to reaffirm the automobile debt. Ms. Currie did not forward this letter to the client or respond to this letter. On February 14, 2005, Ford made a motion for relief from the bankruptcy stay so that it could repossess and sell the clientâ€™s car. Ms. Currie did not file a response. Fordâ€™s motion was granted, and the clientâ€™s car was repossessed. Ms. Currie referred the client to a mortgage broker, who agreed to sell his duplex to buyers she had found. On April 7, 2005, another notice of trusteeâ€™s sale was issued on the clientâ€™s home, setting a foreclosure sale date of May 27, 2005. The client made an oral agreement to sell his home through the mortgage broker, with the understanding that he would be given a lease option to buy back the house at a later date. The client went to independent counsel, who advised him against the transaction. The client decided to go through with the sale anyway. On April 18, 2005, Ms. Currie filed a request for voluntary dismissal of the clientâ€™s bankruptcy, which was granted. The clientâ€™s duplex sold on April 22, 2005. The clientâ€™s home sold on April 28, 2005. On April 25, 2005, Ms. Currie sent an invoice to the clientâ€™s title company requesting a $1,500 â€œfinderâ€™s feeâ€ for referring the client to the mortgage broker. Ms. Currie also requested and received an additional $2,000 for attorneyâ€™s fees from the clientâ€™s escrow. Ms. Currie did not inform the client about the finderâ€™s fee or that she was requesting an additional $2,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees. The client sued Ms. Currie in state court. As part of the settlement in that matter, Ms. Currie paid $20,000 to the client.Ms. Currieâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; and former RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable.Francesca Dâ€™Angelo represented the Bar Association.

1475.html,25096,Christina Denison,,Suspension,4/28/2010,,"Christina S. Denison (WSBA No. 25096, admitted 1995), of Bellevue, was suspended for one year, effective April 28, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to act diligently, communicate promptly, provide reasonable consultation and explanation, comply with requests for information, and return client property and unearned fees.Matter No. 1: On May 12, 2006, Clients O and C, husband and wife, retained Ms. Denison to represent them in an adjustment of status for client C, the wife. At the conference with Ms. Denison, the couple executed a flat fee agreement and paid $1,000 with the balance due in monthly installments, starting in June 2006. Ms. Denison agreed to prepare and file applications for adjustment of status with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) based on â€œlawfulâ€ entry into the United States. The agreement did not specify what forms or applications would be filed. Ms. Denison told the clients she would contact them to set up an appointment once the paperwork was ready to review. Except for income tax returns, the couple provided all necessary documentation to Ms. Denison prior to the end of June.After their first meeting, Client O was initially able to contact Ms. Denison by phone. In later communications, Ms. Denison promised to contact Client O to set up an appointment, but did not follow through. On one or two occasions, Client O was able to secure an appointment for a later date, but when the couple traveled to Ms. Denisonâ€™s office, she failed to show. Around June or July 2006, Client C requested the return of her passport so that she could travel back to her home country to visit her sick mother. At the time Client C indicated her intention to travel and requested her passport, Ms. Denison did not advise her that her application was ready to be filed and lacked only the filing fees. She also did not counsel her client on how to properly protect her immigration status pending a successful adjustment of status.By July 2006, Client O was unable to reach Ms. Denison by phone. The couple traveled unannounced to Ms. Denisonâ€™s office only to discover from other tenants that she had moved. Ms. Denison did not provide her clients with written notice of her move and left no general voice message advising of the move on her telephone answering machine. Ms. Denison stated she gave notice to her clients by handing them a copy of letterhead with her new address. After the clients obtained her new address, the clients appeared twice unannounced at Ms. Denisonâ€™s new office. On the first visit, they were unable to see her; the second time, they waited in her reception area for half an hour until she became available. She apologized for the delay in their matter and told them not to worry. In addition to direct attempts at communication, the clients asked a friend to contact Ms. Denison on their behalf. When Ms. Denison learned the purpose of the call, she terminated the contact due to attorney/client privilege. Thereafter, she took no steps to inquire into the needs of her clients or advise them of the need for a release so that she could communicate with a third party. During the course of representation, Ms. Denison did not initiate a single communication with her clients. In contrast, the couple made more than 30 phone calls to Ms. Denisonâ€™s office.Ms. Denison advised Client C that she would need to file a waiver (I-601), along with an affidavit, because of a potential deficiency in the clientâ€™s â€œlawfulâ€ entry into the United States. Client C did not feel comfortable preparing this affidavit herself and insisted that Ms. Denison prepare it for her. Ms. Denison refused for fear of sanctions by DHS should they find that she colluded with a client to commit fraud. Ms. Denison justified her failure to file the adjustment of status application due to her clientâ€™s refusal to prepare the requested affidavit. However, she did not give her clients the option to file the I-485 (adjustment of status) or the I-601 (waiver) without the affidavit. In addition, Ms. Denison did not make requests to the clients or communicate requests effectively enough that the clients understood they needed to bring the monthly installment payments current or were obligated to pay the filing fee for the application.In early December 2006, Client C consulted with another immigration lawyer. On December 21, 2006, the lawyer faxed Ms. Denison to advise her of his appearance and requested the client file. On January 2, 2007, the lawyer called Ms. Denison again to request delivery of the file within 10 days. Ms. Denison agreed to provide the file when she was able to get to it and abruptly terminated the call. She never contacted the lawyer to notify him that the file was ready for pickup. At the end of January 2007, the WSBA contacted Ms. Denison to request the file, which was promptly delivered the next day; however, Ms. Denison secured a protective order on four immigration documents on the basis of unjust enrichment, effectively preventing the clients from making use of, or receiving any benefit from, any of the work she performed.When the clients demanded return of their fees, Ms. Denison insisted the fees were earned because she had worked 10â€“11 hours on the case. However, she did not maintain any billing records or daily notes to support her claim.  Matter No. 2: On January 2, 2006, Client P met with Ms. Denison to discuss a divorce action, the impact of the divorce action on her immigration status, and alleged domestic abuse by her husband. Client P had been granted temporary permanent resident status in the United States after marriage to her husband. After two incidents of reported domestic violence, Client P left the marital home and moved in with a relative. The husband filed a petition for dissolution of marriage and threatened Client Pâ€™s legal status. Client P sought to live and work permanently in the United States, and to get help with her divorce. Ms. Denison recommended filing a Battered Spouse Petition (BSP) and advised Client P that her retainer would be $4,000. The generic fee agreement bore no client name or contact information. Much of the handwritten paragraph describing legal services to be performed describes the burden on Client P to provide true and accurate information. The only language setting out work to be performed by Ms. Denison states, â€œPrepare and file Battered Spouse Petition on behalf of client.â€ The contract bore Ms. Denisonâ€™s undated signature, and was neither initialed nor signed by the client. The contract made no mention of the divorce action.On January 9, 2006, at Ms. Denisonâ€™s direction, Client P brought in her divorce papers and also made her first payment of $500. Ms. Denison reviewed the documents and advised Client P not to contest the divorce action. Had the contract been fully executed, Client P would have been put on notice that the $4,000 fee did not include any work on her divorce case. Ms. Denison stated she relied on her limited Notice of Entry of Appearance in the I-360 BSP action to put both her client and Homeland Security on notice that she was appearing for the BSP only. Ms. Denison knew that approval of the BSP would not secure her clientâ€™s right to live and work in the United States and that the client would need to file an I-751 (Petition for Removal of Conditions), either while the BSP was pending or immediately after receiving approval of the BSP. Ms. Denison did not advise Client P that an I-751 needed to be filed and that it was simple enough to do herself. The contract did not exclude the I-751 filing; it only required a separate fee or fee agreement for â€œapplicationsâ€ not petitions. Since the I-751 was necessary, Client P reasonably understood that the filing would be included in the fee of $4,000. Client P paid the balance of the $4,000 fee in several installments in January 2006.On or after the end of July 2006, Client P received a Supplemental Notice of I-360 Approval from Homeland Security. At approximately the same time, Ms. Denison moved her office without notice to Client P. The July 2006 notice directed Client P to file an I-765 application for employment authorization. Over a three-month period, Client P called Ms. Denison in excess of 18 times to inquire into her case, but received no response. In November or December of 2006, when Client P was no longer able to reach Ms. Denison by telephone, she traveled to Ms. Denisonâ€™s office, only to find that she had moved. Alarmed and frustrated, Client P sought assistance from a relative, who tried to communicate with Ms. Denison on Client Pâ€™s behalf. Ms. Denison advised the relative that she was unable to speak with him because of attorney/client privilege. On December 28, 2006, Client P, with the help of her relative, faxed and mailed a letter to Ms. Denison requesting a copy of her file and legal contract. On December 29, 2006, Client P appeared unannounced at Ms. Denisonâ€™s new office and was told she could not be seen without an appointment and was threatened with security if she did not leave. Client P prepared three more letters dated January 8, 9, and 15, 2007, expressing her concerns regarding additional time and the sensitive steps she believed were necessary on her case. She also requested a copy of her file and her case receipt.On January 11, 2007, with the help of her relative, Client P accessed information about her case on Homeland Securityâ€™s website. On January 12, 2007, Client P wrote to the WSBA and Homeland Security to complain of misconduct by Ms. Denison and requested the return of her $4,000. Until the 2007 Bar complaint, Ms. Denison stated she had no knowledge of the May 2006 Notice of Approval of the I-360 BSP for her client. Although Ms. Denison could have electronically tracked the case on Homeland Securityâ€™s website, she did not do so and took no action for almost 11 months. Ms. Denison did not maintain billing records and/or daily notes and could not state how many hours she performed on Client Pâ€™s case, but asserted her $4,000 retainer was based on an estimate of hours she intended to spend multiplied by an hourly rate of $250/hour. The contract indicated that work not included in the job description would be billed at $150/hour. Ms. Denisonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a)(2), requiring a lawyer to reasonably consult with the client about the means by which a clientâ€™s objectives are to be accomplished; RPC 1.4(a)(3), requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter; RPC 1.4(a)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses; and RPC 1.16(d), requiring that, upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned or incurred.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

This discipline is based on conduct involving the commission of felonies.On January 26, 2008, Mr. Mix presented one or more counterfeit prescriptions for Clonazepam, Lorazepam, and Chlordiazepoxide, which are Schedule IV controlled substances, to a pharmacy in Genesee County, Michigan. Mr. Mix himself wrote the prescriptions that he presented to the pharmacy. On the basis of the counterfeit prescriptions, the pharmacy provided Mr. Mix with the controlled substances. On July 11, 2008, the Genesee County, Michigan, prosecutor filed an Amended Information charging Mr. Mix with 12 counts of unlawful possession of a controlled substance, in violation of Mich. Compo Laws Â§ 333.7403(2)(b)(ii). These offenses are felonies.On July 11, 2008, Mr. Mix pleaded guilty to the Amended Information. On August 25, 2008, the Genesee County Circuit Court accepted Mr. Mixâ€™s plea, deferred proceedings, and placed Mr. Mix on probation for 60 months. Among other things, the court made it a condition of probation that Mr. Mix not practice law during the 60-month probation term. Mr. Mix has appealed that aspect of his probation.Mr. Mixâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act which reflects disregard for the rule of law, whether the same be committed in the course of his or her conduct as a lawyer, or otherwise, and whether the same constitutes a felony or misdemeanor or not.Joanne S.

Johnston (WSBA No. 23630, admitted 1994), of Seattle, was ordered by a hearing officer to receive a reprimand on July 21, 2006 following approval of a stipulation.  This discipline resulted from conduct involving failure to communicate and dishonesty.	In July 2004, Ms. Johnston was hired to expunge a client's assault conviction in Superior Court. Her client told her that he wished to resolve the matter quickly because he was applying to dental schools. Ms. Johnston discovered that the Clerk's Office could not locate her client's file. Without obtaining the file, in July 2004, Ms. Johnston sent a letter to a dental school informing them that her client qualified for the expungement. In October 2004, Ms. Johnston spoke with a Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, who informed her that her client's conviction required a five-year waiting period prior to expungement, and that the five-year period had not begun to run because a bench warrant had been issued as her client had not paid all that he owed. The Deputy Prosecuting Attorney agreed to quash the warrant and issue a certificate of successful completion if her client paid the outstanding balance. Her client could proceed with the expungement five years after the certificate was issued. Ms. Johnston did not communicate with her client after that conversation until the grievance was filed. She did not tell her client that he was not immediately eligible for expungement or keep him informed as to the status of his case. After August 2004, Ms. Johnston failed to return her client's phone calls or respond to his emails.Ms. Johnstonâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

148.html,3634,Paul Edmondson,,Suspension,6/30/2000,,"Paul D. Edmondson (WSBA No. 3634, admitted 1971), of Yakima, has been suspended for 21 days by order of the Supreme Court approving a stipulation. The suspension was imposed retroactively effective June 30, 2000. This discipline is based upon his practicing law while his license was suspended, and failing to adequately supervise a nonlawyer assistant.Matter 1: On June 7, 2000, Mr. Edmondsonâ€™s license to practice law in Washington was suspended for nonpayment of license fees. Between June 8 and June 29, 2000, Mr. Edmondson filed pleadings, and appeared as a lawyer in Yakima District Court approximately once a week. Mr. Edmondson stated that his assistant, Ms. C, signed for, but did not give him, a February 2000 certified letter notifying him of his failure to pay license fees, and that he did not receive a June 2000 letter sent by regular mail informing him of his suspension. Mr. Edmondson states he first learned of his suspension from opposing counsel on June 30, 2000. Mr. Edmondson then immediately called the WSBA, applied for reinstatement, and paid the necessary fees. He did not practice law from June 30 until his license was reinstated on July 21, 2000.Matter 2: Since 1987, Mr. Edmondson employed Ms. C as a legal assistant and interpreter. In 2001 and for some time before that year, Ms. C accepted legal-fee payments from numerous prospective clients without Mr. Edmondsonâ€™s knowledge. The clients believed they had retained Mr. Edmondson, but Ms. C embezzled the funds and, in some cases, provided clients with fraudulent legal documents. Mr. Edmondson relied on Ms. C to run the office while he was out of town. Her office was on a separate floor, so he was unable to directly observe her interactions with clients or potential clients. Ms. C also spoke Spanish to some clients, and Mr. Edmondson could only partially understand these conversations.In September 2001, Mr. Edmondson received a letter from Ms. H stating that she had paid him for a dissolution in June 1998. Ms. H stated she was never able to reach Mr. Edmondson, and that his secretary told her that her court appearances had been canceled and he was too busy to see her. Mr. Edmondson immediately wrote back expressing concern and telling her he would handle the divorce or refund her money.In November 2001, Mr. Edmondson received a complaint from Mr. and Mrs. X that in February 2001 they had paid a fee, but no work had been performed. Ms. C told Mr. Edmondson the client files and the money in them were missing. Mr. Edmondson received a third complaint in January 2002, at which time he fired Ms. C. On January 8, Mr. Edmondson filed a police report regarding Ms. Câ€™s embezzlement. Mr. Edmondson has since learned of 35 cases in which Ms. C accepted money from prospective clients without his knowledge, and converted the money to personal use. In each case, Mr. Edmondson has offered to honor the fees and perform the legal services without further compensation. In six instances, he refunded the client fees.Mr. Edmondsonâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 8.4(d) and 5.5(a), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; and 5.3, stating that lawyers are responsible for the conduct of nonlawyer assistants in violation of the RPCs.Leslie Allen represented the Bar Association.

Brackbill (WSBA No. 17090, admitted 1987), of Seattle, was suspended for six months, effective May 19, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct involving a failure to act diligently, communicate, and expedite litigation.Clients A and B, owners of a restaurant, retained Mr. Brackbill to pursue a malpractice claim against an architect hired to do the remodel of a space they planned to lease. The clients paid Mr. Brackbill $750 in legal fees. The clients alleged the architect told them no sprinkler system was needed, which was not true. As a result, the clients paid tens of thousands of dollars to install the sprinkler system. After some delay, on March 7, 2006, Mr. Brackbill filed a complaint against the architect in superior court. In July 2006, after the defendant filed an answer and counterclaim, Mr. Brackbill forwarded the pleadings to his clients. Mr. Brackbill failed to respond to the architectâ€™s discovery requests to his clients, and in June 2007, the court compelled Mr. Brackbillâ€™s clients to respond to the discovery requests. Again, Mr. Brackbill failed to respond, and in August 2007, the court dismissed the complaint. By subsequent agreement, Mr. Brackbill and the architectâ€™s counsel agreed to dismiss the architectâ€™s counterclaims for unpaid fees.Client A repeatedly tried to obtain status reports from Mr. Brackbill, with only sporadic success, between 2006 and 2009. Client A had no idea about the discovery requests or that the case had been dismissed until after he filed a grievance with the Bar Association.Mr. Brackbillâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed of the matter and comply with requests for information; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Linda B.

1481.html,16171,Ryan Edgley,,Suspension,6/3/2010,,"Ryan Mark Edgley (WSBA No. 16171, admitted 1986), of Yakima, was suspended for six months, effective June 3, 2010, plus 24 months of probation, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. Mr. Edgley was also ordered to receive a reprimand. This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to comply with mandatory continuing legal education (MCLE) requirements, practice of law while suspended, failure to notify clients of lawyerâ€™s suspension, and failure to file an affidavit of compliance with ELC Title 14.On March 1, 2007, Mr. Edgley missed the deadline to report his compliance with his continuing legal education (CLE) requirement for the 2004â€“2006 reporting cycle. On May 15, 2007, the Association sent Mr. Edgley a Notice of Apparent Non-Compliance, giving him 30 days to report his CLE compliance and stating that he must take action by June 18, 2007, or the CLE Board would take further action. Mr. Edgley signed a return receipt for the notice, but did not provide proof of his compliance by June 18, 2007. The Association sent Mr. Edgley a Pendency Letter on July 13, 2007, informing him that he must take action by July 27, 2007, or the Board would forward to the Supreme Court its recommendation that he be suspended for failure to comply with CLE requirements. On July 25, 2007, Mr. Edgley signed a return receipt for the Pendency Letter and petitioned the Board for an extension until December 31, 2007. The Board approved Mr. Edgleyâ€™s request for an extension on October 2, 2007, but warned that failure to comply would result in further action by the Board which may lead to an order by the Supreme Court suspending him from the practice of law. Mr. Edgley failed to provide proof of his compliance by December 31, 2007.On January 16, 2008, the Association sent Mr. Edgley a second Pendency Letter, requiring him to take action by January 29, 2008, or the Board would recommend his suspension to the Supreme Court for failing to comply with his CLE requirements. Mr. Edgley signed a return receipt for the second Pendency Letter but did not provide proof of his compliance by January 29, 2008. On February 12, 2008, the Association left a voice-mail for Mr. Edgley advising him that he had until 5:00 p.m. on February 20, 2008, to provide proof of his compliance or his name would be sent to the Supreme Court on February 21, 2008, with a recommendation for his suspension due to non-compliance. Mr. Edgley did not provide proof of his compliance by February 20, 2008. On February 28, 2008, the Association sent a letter, via registered mail, notifying Mr. Edgley of his impending suspension. The letter was returned â€œunclaimed.â€ On March 5, 2008, the Supreme Court entered an order suspending Mr. Edgleyâ€™s license to practice law for failure to comply with CLE requirements. The Association mailed Mr. Edgley a copy of the Courtâ€™s order via certified mail. On March 20, 2008, the copy of the order was returned to the Association, marked â€œunclaimed.â€ Mr. Edgley subsequently completed his CLE requirements and was reinstated to practice on April 23, 2008.On July 21, 2008, the Association took Mr. Edgleyâ€™s deposition. At the deposition, Mr. Edgley confirmed that his business address on file with the Association was correct. Mr. Edgley testified he was unaware of his suspension until opposing counsel informed him on March 25, 2008. He admitted that when he learned of his suspension, he failed to notify all of his clients of his suspension or of his inability to act as a lawyer. He also testified that he did not file an affidavit of compliance with ELC Title 14, certifying that he had discontinued the practice of law and notified clients of his inability to act. Mr. Edgley stated that between March 5, 2008, and April 23, 2008, he continued to practice law, notwithstanding his suspended status. While suspended from practice, Mr. Edgley attended a mediation on behalf of a client and settled the clientâ€™s matter; advised clients on legal matters; drafted, filed, and mailed correspondence and other documents relating to client matters; prepared for depositions; communicated with opposing counsel regarding ongoing cases; and engaged in the practice of law on behalf of approximately 17 clients.Mr. Edgleyâ€™s conduct violated RPC 5.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession of that jurisdiction; RPC 5.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in the practice of law while on inactive status, or while suspended from the practice for any cause; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here, ELC Title 14).Sachia Stonefeld Powell and Leslie C. Allen represented the Bar Association. Mr. Edgley represented himself. Dennis W.

1482.html,29944,Shane Nees,,Disbarment,6/3/2010,,"Shane O. Nees (WSBA No. 29944, admitted 2000), of Fairfield, was disbarred, effective June 3, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court, following a default hearing. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to act diligently, failure to communicate, failure to withdraw from representation, making false representations to a tribunal, failure to expedite litigation, failure to return client property, the commission of an illegal act, and failure to cooperate with investigation proceedings.Matter No. 1: In April 2006, Client B hired Mr. Nees to represent her in a personal injury matter that arose out of an auto accident. Later that month, Mr. Nees forwarded a settlement offer from the other party's insurance company to Client B and told her the insurance company was claiming she was 50 percent at fault for the accident. Client B disagreed and declined the offer. In June 2006, the insurance company issued a check to Client B for 50 percent of the damages to her vehicle. She kept the check but did not cash it. Mr. Nees left the firm in March 2007 and, with Client B's agreement, took her case with him. He never informed Client B of his new address and did not change his address of record with the Association until May 22, 2008. The insurance company attempted to contact Mr. Nees regarding Client B's matter, but Mr. Nees did not respond. In April 2007, the insurance company contacted Client B directly to inquire why she had not cashed the check and to advise her that it was ""stale-dated."" Client B called Mr. Nees, who assured her that he would call the insurance company, but he never did and took no further action. Client B tried many times thereafter to contact Mr. Nees for information on her case, but Mr. Nees did not respond. Sometime after March 2008, Client B discovered Mr. Nees's phone had been disconnected. When Client B attempted to deal with the insurance company herself, she was told they could not speak to her since she was represented. Mr. Nees never withdrew from Client B's representation.  On May 19, 2008, Client B filed a grievance against Mr. Nees. On June 17, 2008, Mr. Nees was suspended from the practice of law for nonpayment of licensing fees.Matter No. 2: In April 2006, Mr. Nees filed a personal injury lawsuit on behalf of a husband and wife (Client W) as a result of an automobile accident. When Mr. Nees left his firm in March 2007, he took Client W's case with him. He did not notify the Association of his change of address until May 2008. He never notified Client W of his new address. In July 2007, the defendants in the case prevailed in a mandatory arbitration. Mr. Nees filed for trial de novo, which was set for October 8, 2007, and he informed Client W of the date. Two days before trial, Mr. Nees told Client W that the trial was going to be continued because the docket was too full. After telling Client W that, Mr. Nees appeared in court on October 8, 2007, while Client W, believing the trial would be continued, did not appear. It would not have been necessary to continue the trial if Client W had appeared and Mr. Nees had been prepared for trial. Mr. Nees's statement about the continuance was false. On Mr. Nees's motion, the court continued the trial date to February 2008 and ordered terms of $447.80 to be paid to defendants by November 26, 2007, because Client W failed to appear. Mr. Nees did not advise Client W of the February 2008 date or the order requiring payment of terms. Neither Mr. Nees nor Client W paid the terms. Later, Client W wrote twice to Mr. Nees seeking information about his case, but Mr. Nees did not respond. Client W then left the state for the winter without knowing about the upcoming trial date. On February 1, 2008, Mr. Nees did not appear for a court-appointed pretrial conference, and the court struck the trial date because of his failure to appear. Subsequently, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In response, Mr. Nees filed a motion to continue the trial.  In his declaration accompanying the motion, Mr. Nees falsely stated that he advised Client W of the February 2008 trial date, but that Client W said that he could not drive back due to inclement weather.On March 14, 2008, the court dismissed Client W's action with prejudice, finding that plaintiffs and plaintiffs' attorney had willfully disregarded the court's orders, failed to pay the $447.80 in terms, and failed to appear at the October 2007 trial date. The court awarded the defendants attorney fees and costs of $4,094.67. Client W returned to Washington in March 2008 and left phone messages for Mr. Nees requesting an update of his matter. Mr. Nees did not respond, and on May 12, 2008, Client W filed a grievance.Matter No. 3: On April 2007, Client M hired Mr. Nees to pursue a personal injury matter. Prior to leaving the country for three weeks in August 2007, Client M tried to contact Mr. Nees for an update on his matter, but Mr. Nees did not respond. When Client M returned, he left several voice messages and sent e-mails to Mr. Nees, who again did not respond. Only after Client M threatened to terminate Mr. Nees on October 9, 2007, did Mr. Nees respond to Client M's request for information. At the end of November 2007, Client M sent Mr. Nees a medical report and asked Mr. Nees to keep him updated on any progress made in the matter. Mr. Nees informed Client M in December 2007 and January 2008 that progress was being made in negotiations and that he was working on a settlement package to present to the other party. Client M tried to contact Mr. Nees after January 2008 to obtain status of the matter, but Mr. Nees did not respond. Mr. Nees never completed or forwarded the settlement package to the other party. On March 11, 2008, Client M terminated Mr. Nees's representation by e-mail and requested his client file. Mr. Nees did not respond to Client M's e-mail or return his file. Client M then contacted the Association for help in obtaining his file. Mr. Nees did not respond to the Association's requests and did not return Client M's file. On April 21, 2008, Client M filed a grievance against Mr. Nees.Matter No. 4: In October 2007, Client D hired Mr. Nees to pursue a personal injury claim on her behalf and provided Mr. Nees with documents related to the accident. Mr. Nees advised Client D to call him on February 27, 2008, after seeing her doctor, to discuss strategy for settlement. On that day, Client D left Mr. Nees messages, but Mr. Nees did not respond. He also did not respond to multiple subsequent calls from Client D. When it was clear that Mr. Nees took no action to settle the matter or pursue it in court, Client D hired another attorney. Client D called Mr. Nees and left messages informing him that she was terminating his representation and asked him to return her client file and paperwork. Mr. Nees did not respond to Client D's calls, or return her file or the documents she had given him. On April 3, 2008, Client D filed a grievance against Mr. Nees. On May 20, 2008, Mr. Nees filed an untimely response to Client D's grievance. He never returned Client D's file.Matter No. 5: Mr. Nees was hired by Client J's company to collect on two debts. In the first case, Mr. Nees obtained a judgment and order directing the debtor's employer to garnish the debtor's wages and pay $386.60 to Client J. The employer paid the funds on June 4, 2008, via check made payable to Mr. Nees. In the second case, Mr. Nees obtained a default judgment against the debtor. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Nees was terminated by Client J's company, who hired a new lawyer. The new lawyer sought to collect the judgment by garnishing the debtor's employer. The employer paid the funds to the clerk of the court in September and October 2008. The clerk forwarded the two payment checks, totaling $1,812.35, to Mr. Nees instead of to Client J's new lawyer. In both cases, Mr. Nees endorsed the checks and negotiated them without notifying Client J of the receipt of the checks or tendering payment of the funds to Client J. Mr. Nees was not entitled to any offsets for fees or costs. Client J found out about the payments when it contacted the employer and the garnishee defendant and was given copies of the cancelled checks. In the second case, Mr. Nees negotiated the checks after he was suspended from the practice of law. Client J filed a grievance against Mr. Nees on September 19, 2008.Failure to Cooperate: In all but one of the foregoing matters, Mr. Nees failed to respond to the Association's requests for his response to client grievances. In Matter No. 4, Mr. Nees's response was untimely. The Association had to subpoena Mr. Nees for a non-cooperation deposition, to be held on September 23, 2008. Mr. Nees did not appear at the deposition. On October 17, 2008, the Association filed a petition with the Supreme Court for an interim suspension based on Mr. Nees's failure to cooperate with the grievance investigations. The Court ordered Mr. Nees to appear on November 18, 2008, to show cause why the petition should not be granted. Mr. Nees contacted the Association after the order was issued and said that he would provide written responses to the grievances by November 10, 2008, but failed to do so. Mr. Nees did not appear at the show cause hearing or file a response to the petition for interim suspension. On November 19, 2008, the Court granted the Association's petition and suspended Mr. Nees from the practice of law. On June 3, 2010, Mr. Nees was disbarred.Mr. Nees's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to promptly communicate with a client and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.16(d), requiring that, upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned or incurred; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; RPC 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects (here, RCW 9A.56.030, 9A.56.040); RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act of moral turpitude, corruption, or other act reflecting the disregard for the rule of law; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct.M.

1483.html,21855,Sans Gilmore,,Reprimand,2/9/2009,,"Sans M. Gilmore (WSBA No. 21855, admitted 1992), of Tumwater, WA, was ordered to receive a reprimand, effective February 9, 2009, following approval of a stipulation by the hearing officer. This discipline is based on conduct involving trust account irregularities.	The Bar Association conducted an audit of Mr. Gilmoreâ€™s trust account for the period of January 1, 2007 through January 25, 2008. The audit revealed that Mr. Gilmore failed to maintain a complete checkbook register or complete client ledgers and failed to reconcile his checkbook register, trust account bank statements, or client ledgers. His trust account was short client funds. Through a merchant credit card account tied to his trust account, Mr. Gilmore would accept credit card payments for both earned fees and advance fee deposits. Thus, he commingled earned fees with his client funds. Mr. Gilmore also withdrew credit card receipts before they were actually deposited in the bank, thereby disbursing funds before the associated deposit had been collected and using other clientsâ€™ funds, and did not account for merchant fees, thereby disbursing himself more than he actually received.	Mr. Gilmoreâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.15A(c)(1), requiring a lawyer to deposit and hold in a trust account funds subject to the Rules; RPC 1.15A(h)(1), prohibiting funds belonging to the lawyer from being deposited or retained in a trust account except funds to pay bank charges, funds belonging in part to a client or third person and in partpresently or potentially to the lawyer, and funds necessary to restore appropriate balances; RPC 1.15A(h)(2), requiring a lawyer to keep complete records as required by the Rules; RPC 1.15A(h)(6), requiring trust account records to be reconciled as often as bank statements are generated or at least quarterly; RPC 1.15A(h)(7), prohibiting a lawyer from disbursing funds from a trust account until deposits have cleared the banking process and been collected; RPC 1.15A(h)(8), prohibiting a lawyer from making disbursements on behalf of a client or third person that exceed the funds of that person on deposit; and RPC 1.15B(a)(1) and (2), requiring a lawyer to maintain current trust account records, which includes keeping a checkbook register or equivalent for each trust account and keeping individual client ledger records containing either a separate page for each client or an equivalent electronic record showing all individual receipts, disbursements, or transfers.

1488.html,7370,Paul King,,Disbarment,6/10/2010,,"Paul H. King (WSBA No. 7370, admitted 1977), of La Union, Philippines, formerly of Seattle, was disbarred, effective June 10, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. This discipline was based on conduct involving representation of a client while suspended from the practice of law and failure to cooperate with disciplinary proceedings. For more information, see In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against King, 168 Wn.2d 888, 232 P.3d 1095 (2010).Mr. King was suspended from the practice of law from March 9, 2005, until June 7, 2005. In September 2004, Mr. King was retained by Client R to represent him in potential litigation against his employer. Mr. King retained a local Virginia attorney to assist in filing the lawsuit in Virginia state court. The case was later removed to U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Mr. King was the lead lawyer in the litigation but did not apply for pro hac vice admission.On March 9, 2005, Mr. King notified attorneys for the opposing side, via e-mail, that he was ""taking a leave"" and that all pleadings should be sent to another lawyer at the same address. Mr. King did not inform Client R or his Virginia co-counsel that he was ""taking a leave."" Despite this e-mail, Mr. King continued to act as the lead lawyer in the litigation and never advised Client R to seek other counsel due to Mr. King's suspension. On March 25, 2005, Mr. King submitted a declaration to the Association stating that he had concluded his affairs and closed his practice by March 9, 2005, and that he had no active clients. On May 26, 2005, Mr. King's co-counsel discovered that Mr. King was suspended and informed Client R, who fired Mr. King on May 31, 2005, and simultaneously filed a grievance against him.Disciplinary counsel sent Mr. King a request to respond to Client R's grievance. Mr. King prepared a summons and complaint designating himself as plaintiff and Client R as defendant and attempted service on Client R between July 18 and July 26, 2005. The complaint listed a fake case number and asserted claims and damages arising from Client R's termination of Mr. King, as well as several false statements, including that Mr. King was ""licensed to practice law at all times relevant to this lawsuit"" and that Client R fired Mr. King on March 9, 2005. Mr. King sent disciplinary counsel notice of the lawsuit on July 22, 2005, and asked that the grievance investigation be deferred. The request was denied by disciplinary counsel. Mr. King later filed a one-page response to Client R's grievance 83 days after he initially indicated he would respond. On October 12 and November 2, 2005, disciplinary counsel issued subpoenas duces tecum commanding Mr. King to appear and produce documents. While the Association was still investigating Client R's claims, disciplinary counsel deposed Witness M regarding Mr. King's actions; however, the testimony was never offered in any proceeding.On November 21, 2005, Mr. King filed a motion for protective order with the Association, arguing that the Association lacked jurisdiction over Client R's grievance because the case was pending in Virginia, and that testimony from Witness M needed to be suppressed because Mr. King had not received notice of the deposition. The next day, Mr. King failed to show up for his deposition. The Disciplinary Board chair denied his motion for protective order on June 6, 2006, and Mr. King was sent notice of the rescheduled deposition.On July 20, 2006, Mr. King filed a motion to terminate the deposition and did not appear at the deposition or produce documents required by the subpoena. His motion was later denied, and Mr. King was notified that the deposition would resume on September 5, 2006. His assistant sent a fax to disciplinary counsel on September 1, 2006, indicating Mr. King was out of town for the holiday and not expected back until after September 5. Mr. King did not appear or produce documents at the September 5 deposition.On January 5, 2007, a Disciplinary Board Review Committee ordered a hearing on Client R's grievance. Mr. King filed a motion to vacate the order, which the Disciplinary Board Chair denied. Subsequently, Mr. King filed a motion to vacate the chair's second denial and a separate notice of unavailability on March 12, 2007, stating he would be unavailable until June 19, 2007. Disciplinary counsel filed and served a formal complaint on Mr. King on May 8, 2007, without ever taking his deposition. A hearing officer was appointed in July 2007. After the hearing officer was appointed, Mr. King amended a petition for writ of mandamus to include the hearing officer's name and filed a witness list that included the hearing officer, disciplinary counsel, the 13 Disciplinary Board members, and five other employees of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. The hearing officer found that Mr. King did not have a good-faith intention to call these witnesses and struck the disciplinary counsel, the Board members, and himself from the list. A month before his hearing, Mr. King filed a motion asking the hearing officer to recuse himself because he was a named party on the mandamus action. The motion was denied.Mr. King's hearing began April 28, 2008, and concluded May 12, 2008. Among other findings, the hearing officer found that from the start, Mr. King continuously treated disciplinary proceedings as a ""cat-and-mouse game"" by failing to comply with orders, cooperate in post-complaint discovery, and ""repeatedly waiting until the last minute to raise objections that could have been raised months earlier."" Mr. King made 17 separate efforts (including appeals) to halt or delay the hearing, most of which were frivolous.In his appeal of the hearing officer's disbarment recommendation, Mr. King did not dispute the hearing officer's reasoning and conclusions that Mr. King's actions violated multiple ethical rules or that a number of those violations independently warranted disbarment. Mr. King never challenged the hearing officer's findings of fact, but rather alleged violations of due process and appearance of fairness. The Supreme Court found Mr. King's due process rights had not been violated and that his claims of fundamental unfairness were unfounded, and ordered Mr. King disbarred.Mr. King's conduct violated RPC 3.1, prohibiting a lawyer from bringing or defending a proceeding, or asserting or controverting an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; RPC 5.8(e), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in the practice of law while on inactive status, or while suspended from the practice of law for any cause; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer (here, RCW 2.48.180, 9A.72.020, 9A.72.040); RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4 (j), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order directing him or her to do or cease doing an act which he or she ought in good faith to do or forbear; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Scott G.

1489.html,13836,Terry Preszler,,Suspension,6/17/2010,,"Terry J. Preszler (WSBA No. 13836, admitted 1983), of Kennewick, was suspended for three years, effective June 17, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court, following an appeal. This discipline was based on conduct involving charging unreasonable fees, providing erroneous legal advice, submitting false documents to a tribunal, failing to supervise a non-lawyer employee, and disbursing funds without permission of the court. See In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Preszler 169 Wn.2d 1, 232 P.3d 1118 (2010) (No. 200,570-5).On December 19, 2000, Clients K and J hired Mr. Preszler to represent them in a chapter 13 bankruptcy. Client K told Mr. Preszler of her unresolved pre-bankruptcy personal injury claim stemming from an auto accident that occurred on September 6, 2000. Without learning the details of the injury claim or its value, Mr. Preszler listed the claim as an asset of the bankruptcy estate with a current value of $16,150 when he filed the chapter 13 bankruptcy on April 4, 2001. On October 12, 2001, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Washington entered the order confirming Client K and Jâ€™s chapter 13 plan. At the time, Mr. Preszler did not represent Client K in her personal injury claim.By August 18, 2003, Client K had not settled her claim and the statute of limitations was about to run. The clients met with Mr. Preszler, who told them that he believed Client Kâ€™s claim was worth $53,000, which Client K said she would accept. Mr. Preszler said he was not interested in handling the case because of the statute of limitations, but as a courtesy he would contact the insurance adjuster handling the claim. Mr. Preszler and Clients K and J understood he would not receive a fee for his help. The insurance adjuster told Mr. Preszler that she needed additional medical information from Client K before the claim could be reevaluated. The adjuster did not believe that Mr. Preszler was representing Client K. Mr. Preszler instructed Client K to deliver the necessary records to the adjuster and reiterated that he did not want to take the case.On August 19, 2003, the clients met with Mr. Preszler. Client J wanted to hire Mr. Preszler to handle the personal injury claim, but Client K had suffered a personal loss the day before and was too emotional to make a decision. Mr. Preszler advised her not to decide that day and she did not hire him.On August 20, 2003, Client K saw her doctor and requested that he fax her medical records to the insurance adjuster. The next day, Client K called the adjuster to discuss her claim and, at her request, the adjuster sent a letter outlining their conversation to Mr. Preszler, who reviewed it. On August 22, 2003, after receiving the medical information, the adjuster called Client K and offered her policy limits of $50,000, out of which $19,000 would reimburse Insurance Company B for PIP benefits and the remaining $31,000 would go to Client K. To accept the offer, Client K needed to sign a release of claims against the insurance companyâ€™s insured. At Client Kâ€™s request, the adjuster faxed the release and a letter confirming the settlement offer to Mr. Preszler.That same day, Client K met with Mr. Preszler to discuss the settlement paperwork. Mr. Preszler explained that he could ask for the personal injury exemption in the bankruptcy plan to be increased from $16,150 to $17,425, but the remainder of the settlement proceeds would go to Client K and Jâ€™s creditors in the bankruptcy. Mr. Preszler did not advise Client K that almost $10,000 more could have been exempted under the â€œWild Cardâ€ exemption. Client K signed a contingency fee agreement with Mr. Preszler, which was backdated to August 18, 2003. The fee agreement provided that Mr. Preszler would receive one-third of the remaining $31,000. Mr. Preszler promised that Client K would receive $17,425 and handwrote a guarantee to that effect on the fee agreement. Mr. Preszler sent the settlement paperwork to the adjuster and requested a settlement check payable to Client K and himself. On August 27, 2003, Mr. Preszlerâ€™s office received the check and deposited it as a credit to Client K in Mr. Preslzerâ€™s trust account. Mr. Preszler instructed his paralegal to contact the bankruptcy trustee to determine the process for disbursing the funds to himself. Based on directions from the trusteeâ€™s employee, Mr. Preszlerâ€™s paralegal drafted an application for an order approving Mr. Preszlerâ€™s appointment as an attorney for the trustee in the personal injury claim. Being unfamiliar with the application, Mr. Preszler asked his paralegal if the trustee wanted the application; the trustee confirmed he did. Mr. Preszler signed the application without reading it thoroughly or fully understanding it. The application described Mr. Preszler as a fiduciary to Client K and Jâ€™s bankruptcy estate and represented, under penalty of perjury, that â€œthe case needs an attorney to settleâ€ and that Mr. Preszler would render services to â€œsettle with [the insurance company] the personal injury claimâ€ and would be paid pursuant to the contingent fee agreement executed by Client K. The application required Mr. Preszler to take payment under the contingent fee agreement in accordance with federal law and bankruptcy court rules which require approval by the bankruptcy judge prior to the time payment is disbursed. When the trustee received the application, he did not know that Client Kâ€™s claim had already been settled.With the settlement in hand, Mr. Preszler prepared and reviewed the bankruptcy schedules. He did not indicate the current market value of Client Kâ€™s personal injury claim. Schedule C claimed that $17,425 of the proceeds from the car accident claim was exempt from creditors, but Mr. Preszler wrote â€œ[u]nknownâ€ in the schedule C space for the current market value of the car accident claim. On August 29, 2003, Clients K and J signed the amended schedules. After reviewing the amended schedules, the trustee learned about the settlement with Insurance Company, and discovered the fee agreement bore the date of August 18, 2003, when it had actually been signed on August 22, 2003. Although the trustee had concerns, he did not pursue them.On September 3, 2003, Mr. Preszlerâ€™s paralegal was told that the trustee signed the application but could not file it until Clients K and J agreed to commit nonexempt proceeds from Client Kâ€™s personal injury claim to funding the bankruptcy plan. Mr. Preszler signed and filed a stipulation agreeing to commit the nonexempt proceeds to funding the plan. Mr. Preszlerâ€™s paralegal prepared an order approving employment, which Mr. Preszler signed. The order stated Mr. Preszler was employed for an ongoing personal injury case and provided that Mr. Preszler would â€œcontinue the personal injury case in order to obtain a resolution and settlement.â€ The order mandated that compensation accord with federal statutes and bankruptcy court rules requiring Mr. Preszler request court approval to disburse prior to doing so. Mr. Preszler and the bankruptcy judge signed the order. On September 15 and 16, 2003, without first obtaining a court order, Mr. Preszler disbursed $10,323 to himself from Clients K and Jâ€™s trust account. Mr. Preszler did not prepare a settlement statement nor did he disclose the disbursement to the clients, the trustee, or the bankruptcy court.In late September 2003, Client K learned that she might have been able to use more of the settlement payment to reduce the term of her chapter 13 bankruptcy plan. She hired a new bankruptcy attorney, who informed Mr. Preszler that he had failed to use the wild card exemption. The new attorney asked Mr. Preszler to waive his fee so that the exemptions could be amended to provide the clients with an additional $9,650 of personal injury claim recovery. He also indicated the rest of the settlement could be used to reduce the term of the clientâ€™s plan and that Mr. Preszler was not entitled to the contingent fee because the case had settled prior to the execution of the agreement. The attorney demanded that Mr. Preszler pay the clients all money received from Insurance Company. He also demanded an itemization of the money actually received, how much had been paid to the clients, and a check for the difference. The attorney offered to have Clients K and J sign a release of all claims against Mr. Preszler.Mr. Preszler compiled with the demands and reimbursed his trust account with the contingent fee he had taken. However, the itemization did not include the portion of the client ledger related to his disbursement to himself or the replacement of the funds back to the trust account. After Clients K and J signed the release, Mr. Preszler issued a check to Client K. The new attorney filed a new amended schedule that included an additional exemption of the personal injury claim proceeds and applied the remaining proceeds to reduce the number of payments to creditors.In his appeal of the Disciplinary Boardâ€™s decision, Mr. Preszler did not argue he did nothing wrong. Rather, he argued that a single instance of impropriety did not justify a finding of conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; that two counts of misconduct should be merged; and that the Disciplinary Board erred in its sanctions analysis. The Court upheld the Boardâ€™s recommendation for a three-year suspension.Mr. Preszlerâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee be reasonable; former RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 3.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly disobeying an obligation under the rules of a tribunal except for an open refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists; former RPC 5.3(b) and (c)(1), requiring a lawyer with direct supervisory authority over a non-lawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the personâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer, and requiring the lawyer be responsible for conduct of such a person that would be a violation of the RPC if engaged in by a lawyer, if the lawyer orders or, with knowledge of the conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; and former RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Jonathan H.

149.html,367,Byron Coney,,Reprimand,4/9/2002,,"Byron D. Coney (WSBA No. 367, admitted 1955), of Seattle, has received a reprimand, following a hearing. The discipline is based upon his failure to comply with his clientâ€™s decisions concerning the scope of representation in 1997.Between 1993 and 1997, Mr. Coney had a romantic relationship with Ms. R. During this time, Mr. Coney represented Ms. R on various legal matters.In July 1995, Ms. R sold real property on Vashon Island. Six months after the sale, the purchasers sued Ms. R and her real estate brokerage, alleging that they had misrepresented the adequacy of the water supply available from the propertyâ€™s well. Mr. Coney appeared for Ms. R and the real estate company. He told Ms. R that he would not charge her fees, but that if they prevailed, he would seek fees from the purchasers. In May 1997, Ms. R obtained new counsel. New counsel billed Ms. R and she paid the bills. In July, the trial court found for Ms. R in the lawsuit and ordered the purchasers to pay Ms. Râ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.In July 1997, Mr. Coney re-associated as counsel for Ms. R for the limited purpose of presenting a claim for attorneyâ€™s fees. In August, Mr. Coney filed a claim for $22,500 in attorneyâ€™s fees and $9,410 in costs. The costs included $8,800 in CR 11 sanctions Mr. Coney paid in connection with a court-ordered dismissal of a third-party defamation case Mr. Coney filed against some of the purchaserâ€™s neighbors. Ms. Râ€™s new counsel and the purchaserâ€™s counsel continued to negotiate the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees and did not include Mr. Coney in the negotiations. Mr. Coney sent a fax to Ms. Râ€™s new counsel stating that he would not authorize settling his attorneyâ€™s fees for less than the full amount without his prior written consent.In August 1997, the parties settled the attorneyâ€™s fees for $40,000. Ms. Râ€™s new counselâ€™s fees were approximately $26,000, and costs for an expert were under $10,000. New counsel sent a letter to Mr. Coney regarding the settlement, indicating that any matters about earlier attorneyâ€™s fees were between Ms. R and Mr. Coney, and would not involve new counsel.In August 1997, the trial court entered the judgment and dismissed the entire lawsuit. When Mr. Coney, who had been out of town, returned and learned of the judgment, he filed a motion to alter and amend judgment of dismissal. This motion asked the court to re-open the case to enter an award of attorneyâ€™s fees to him; however, Mr. Coney did not ask his clientâ€™s permission to re-open the case. New counsel wrote a letter to Mr. Coney asking him to withdraw the motion, pointing out that the client would incur additional attorneyâ€™s fees. Ms. R signed a declaration opposing the motion; however, Mr. Coney proceeded.The hearing officer found that Mr. Coney had a conflict of interest with his client at the time he pursued this motion to amend. The court dismissed Mr. Coneyâ€™s motion and awarded Ms. R $1,200 in fees against him. Mr. Coney filed a notice of appeal of the decision without his clientâ€™s consent. The Court of Appeals dismissed the case on a motion on the merits, stating that the appeal was ""frivolous in every sense."" The court commissioner awarded the client attorneyâ€™s fees on appeal.In November 1998, Ms. R filed a civil suit against Mr. Coney to dissolve a trust established during their relationship. Mr. Coney counterclaimed for his attorneyâ€™s fees in the real estate litigation. Mr. Coney also filed a third-party claim against Ms. Râ€™s new counsel for attorneyâ€™s fees in the real estate matter. On April 9, 2000, Ms. R filed a grievance against Mr. Coney. On April 10, Mr. Coney and Ms. R settled their lawsuit.Mr. Coneyâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 3.1, prohibiting lawyers from filing frivolous claims; 1.2(a), requiring lawyers to abide by their clientâ€™s decisions concerning the scope of representation; and 1.7(b), prohibiting lawyers from representing a client if the representation is materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests.Linda Eide and Michael D.

This discipline is based on conduct in two matters involving failure to competently perform legal services, failure to obey a court order, violating a duty to report a sanction, failure to communicate, and non-cooperation in State Bar disciplinary investigations, as well as conduct involving failure to comply with conditions attached to a reproval and failure to submit proof of MCLE course completion. For more information, see the attorney directory at the State Bar of Californiaâ€™s website at www.calbar.ca.gov.Mr. Campa violated Californiaâ€™s RPC 1-110, requiring a lawyer to comply with conditions attached to public or private reprovals or other discipline administered by the State Bar; Californiaâ€™s RPC 3-110(A), prohibiting a member from intentionally, recklessly, or repeatedly failing to perform legal services with competence; Californiaâ€™s Business and Professions Code Â§ 6068(i), requiring an attorney to cooperate and participate in any disciplinary investigation or other regulatory or disciplinary proceeding pending against himself or herself; Californiaâ€™s Business and Professions Code Â§ 6068(m), requiring a lawyer to respond promptly to reasonable status inquiries of clients and to keep clients reasonably informed of significant developments in matters with regard to which the attorney has agreed to provide legal services; Californiaâ€™s Business and Professions Code Â§ 6068(o)(3), requiring a lawyer to report the imposition of judicial sanctions against the attorney; and Californiaâ€™s Business and Professions Code Â§ 6103, requiring a lawyer to obey court orders to do or forbear an act connected with or in the course of his profession, which he ought in good faith to do or forbear.

This discipline is based on conduct that resulted in a felony conviction. In stipulating to disbarment, Ms. Whitlow-Clark does not affirmatively admit the misconduct set forth below but acknowledges that, under ELC 10.14(c), the court record of the conviction would be conclusive evidence of her guilt at a disciplinary hearing and that there is a substantial likelihood the Association would be able to prove, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, the misconduct.On July 9, 2000, Ms. Whitlow-Clark shot and killed a former boyfriend in Dallas, Texas. On December 21, 2000, Ms. Whitlow-Clark was indicted under V.T.C.A., Penal Code Â§ 19.02 for first degree murder for intentionally and knowingly causing the death of her former boyfriend by shooting him with a firearm. State of Texas v. Whitlow-Clark, Dallas County Court, 265th Judicial District, No. F00-22003-PR. This crime is a felony. On February 6, 2003, a jury found Ms. Whitlow-Clark guilty of first degree murder.Ms. Whitlow-Clark's conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer; and RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act of moral turpitude, or corruption, or any unjustified act of assault or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law, whether the same be committed in the course of his or her conduct as a lawyer, or otherwise, and whether the same constitutes a felony or misdemeanor or not.Joanne S.

1493.html,29692,Young Oh,,Reprimand,12/29/2009,,"Young Suk Oh (WSBA No. 29692, admitted 1999), of Lynnwood, was ordered to receive a reprimand on December 29, 2009, following a hearing. This discipline was based on conduct involving trust account irregularities.In October 2006, the Bar Association received a trust account overdraft notice from Bank A when a check of $21,750 was presented for payment at the time the balance on the trust account was $5,877.39. The Association began an audit of Mr. Oh's trust account records from May 2006 to September 2006.In 2005, Mr. Oh was the mutual escrow agent for the buyer and seller in the sale of a business transaction. The funds from the sale were deposited into Mr. Oh's IOLTA account at Bank A. In October 2005, the parties agreed that Mr. Oh would ""hold back"" $24,600 of the funds until they agreed on the disbursement. The funds remained in Mr. Oh's IOLTA account into early 2006. Several times, Mr. Oh was instructed to write a check from the funds and then was instructed to cancel the check. Around May 2006, Mr. Oh asked another attorney to draft an interpleader action to deposit the funds into court. Mr. Oh issued a check for $21,745 to the county clerk. Before the action could be filed, Mr. Oh was instructed to wait because the parties were negotiating. Mr. Oh placed the $21,745 check in the file but did not mark ""void"" on it. In the client ledger, he cancelled the $21,745 check to show the correct balance held for the client.In early 2006, Mr. Oh opened a new IOLTA account with Bank B and began to phase out the Bank A IOLTA account. Near the end of May 2006, Mr. Oh stopped writing checks from the Bank A account; by then most of the funds had been transferred to the new IOLTA account at Bank B. In September 2006, Mr. Oh arranged to file the interpleader action prepared in May 2006 and sent the $21,745 check issued under the old account at Bank A along with the complaint to the county clerk. At the time, there was only $5,877.39 left in the Bank A trust account. This caused an overdraft.During the audit period, the Association identified four payments from Mr. Oh's trust account that were made with other client funds. During this time period, Mr. Oh made payments on behalf of clients before the funds were deposited in the trust account, notwithstanding that he had been notified in September 2005 that this practice violated the RPCs. Disbursements were made on behalf of clients when there were insufficient funds on deposit, thereby placing other client funds at risk.Mr. Oh's conduct violated former RPC 1.14 and/or RPC 1.15A(h)(7), prohibiting a lawyer from disbursing funds from a trust account until deposits have cleared the banking process and been collected, unless the lawyer and bank have a written agreement by which the lawyer personally guarantees all disbursements from the account without recourse to the trust account; and former RPC 1.14 and/or RPC 1.15A(h)(8), prohibiting disbursements on behalf of a client or third person from exceeding the funds of that person on deposit and prohibiting the funds of a client or third person from being used on behalf of anyone else.Kevin M.

Starczewski (WSBA No. 26111, admitted 1996) of Wenatchee, was ordered to receive a reprimand on May 19, 2010, following approval of a stipulation by a hearing officer. This discipline is based on conduct involving filing frivolous allegations without a good-faith basis.Ms. Starczewski represented a lawyer in litigation against attorneys F and J. Her client represented patients in civil actions against a physician convicted of rape and sexual abuse against several of his patients. The physician had a twin brother, also a doctor. The twin brother filed a defamation suit against Ms. Starczewskiâ€™s client because of statements her client made to news outlets about the twin impersonating his brother to sexually assault his brotherâ€™s patients. Attorneys F and J represented the twin brother. In September 2005, the defamation case was dismissed on Ms. Starczewskiâ€™s clientâ€™s summary judgment motion.On January 23, 2006, Ms. Starczewski, on behalf of her client, filed a complaint in superior court alleging Attorney F and his law firm engaged in malicious civil prosecution by filing and pursuing the defamation action against him. Two days later, Ms. Starczewski filed an amended complaint adding malicious civil prosecution and abuse of process claim against Attorney J and his firm. In March 2006, Ms. Starczewski filed a Second Amended Complaint adding Attorney Jâ€™s lawyer as a defendant, stating he was also involved in the malicious prosecution against her client. The Second Amended Complaint also alleged the defendants â€œassisted and conspired with the [two brothers], and others, to help destroy, hide and secrete. . . relevant evidenceâ€ and used the twin brother as a â€œfrontâ€ client for an unnamed entity. These claims were frivolous and were made without a basis in law or in fact.In May 2006, the defendants moved to dismiss under CR 12(b)(6) or for summary judgment. The court dismissed all claims against the defendants in June 2006. In July 2006, Attorney J filed a motion for sanctions under CR11. The court found the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint were baseless and not well grounded in fact, and were advanced without any reasonable or competent inquiry. The court assessed sanctions of $5,000 against Ms. Starczewski and her client jointly and ordered Ms. Starczewski and her client to pay $11,037 to Attorney J.Ms. Starczewskiâ€™s conduct violated RPC 3.1, prohibiting a lawyer from bringing or defending a proceeding, or asserting or controverting an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good-faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of law.Francesca Dâ€™Angelo represented the Bar Association.

For more information, see the Oregon State Bar Bulletin (November 2008), available at www.osbar.org/publications/bulletin/08nov/baractions.html, as follows:On October 12, 2008, the [Oregon] disciplinary board reprimanded Salem attorney John Michael Unfred for violations of RPC 1.3 (neglect of a legal matter); RPC 1.4(a) (failure to keep client reasonably informed and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information) and RPC 1.5(a) (charging a clearly excessive fee).Unfred undertook to represent a dissolution client in April 2006, agreeing to charge her at a discounted rate pursuant to a contract that Unfred had earlier entered with the clientâ€™s employee assistance program. During the representation, which lasted approximately one year, Unfred billed the client at the undiscounted rate. In June 2007, after becoming dissatisfied with Unfredâ€™s inactivity on her case, the client fired him, complained to the bar and demanded that he return her entire retainer. Unfred did so.For several months after Unfred was retained, he was active on the clientâ€™s case. However, after January 2007, the client telephoned and emailed Unfred with questions and requests for action, but received only occasional, non-substantive responses from Unfredâ€™s paralegal.Unbeknownst to the client, Unfred was not receiving her telephone calls and emails. Unfredâ€™s paralegal was intercepting them and then failing to pass them along to him. Unfred was unaware that the client was trying to contact him until she fired him in June 2007.Unfred did no work on the clientâ€™s case between January 2007 and June 2007, nor did he communicate with her during this time.By billing the client at the undiscounted rate, Unfred charged a clearly excessive fee, even though he ultimately refunded her entire retainer. Unfred also failed to adequately supervise his staff and failed to act diligently on his clientâ€™s case, effectively leaving her dissolution unattended for several months. Mitigating circumstances in this case include the absence of dishonest or selfish motive, personal or emotional problems, a cooperative attitude toward disciplinary proceedings, and a timely good faith effort to make restitution or rectify consequences of misconduct. Unfred was admitted to practice in Oregon in 1989. He had no prior disciplinary record. Joanne S. Abelson represented the Bar Association.

This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to adequately supervise non-lawyer staff and practicing law while suspended. Mr. Singer is to be distinguished from Alan Michael Singer of Olympia.In December 2008, Mr. Singer received a license renewal packet for 2009 from the Association. Between December 2008 and February 2009, the Association sent three e-mails to Mr. Singer reminding him about licensing renewal for 2009, which he had not yet completed. In March 2009, Mr. Singerâ€™s office received a pre-suspension notice that was sent by the Association by certified mail, and later by e-mail, instructing him to take immediate action to avoid suspension. The Chief Justice of the Washington State Supreme Court entered an order (Order) in May 2009 suspending Mr. Singer from the practice of law, effective June 1, 2009, for failing to comply with licensing requirements. Mr. Singerâ€™s staff received a letter from the Association informing Mr. Singer about the suspension Order. Mr. Singer did not take the necessary actions to comply with his licensing. During the period in question, Mr. Singer directed his staff to take care of his licensing requirements, but he did not adequately supervise them and he did not check e-mails because he was having problems receiving spam. On June 1, 2009, Mr. Singer was suspended from the practice of law under the May 2009 Order. Unaware of his suspension, Mr. Singer continued to engage in the practice of law, including signing and filing a notice of appearance in district court and appearing in a district court hearing on behalf of a client in a criminal matter. After the hearing, the court clerk informed Mr. Singer of his suspension. Mr. Singer ceased actively practicing law, but did not take the appropriate steps to cease holding himself out as a lawyer and allowed his office staff continued to work on legal matters for him. Mr. Singerâ€™s office directory continued to list Mr. Singer as a lawyer and his correspondence continued to reflect that he was a lawyer. In June 10, 2009, an Association investigator went to Mr. Singerâ€™s office and informed his staff about the suspension, and they informed Mr. Singer about the investigatorâ€™s visit. That same day, Mr. Singer took the necessary steps to comply with his licensing requirements and obtain reinstatement. The Association opened a grievance against Mr. Singer for practicing law while suspended. Mr. Singerâ€™s conduct violated RPC 5.3, requiring a lawyer with direct supervisory authority over a non-lawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the non-lawyerâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; and RPC 5.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in the practice of law while on inactive status, or while suspended from the practice of law for any cause.Jonathan H.

This discipline was based on conduct involving lack of competence, failure to act diligently and promptly, failure to return client property, failure to cooperate with a Bar investigation, failure to notify parties of suspension, and practicing law while suspended.In October 2003, Mr. Pak was hired by a husband and wife (clients) to represent them in a lawsuit on the wrongful death of their son, who had died while trying to save his girlfriend from drowning in a swimming pool at a resort in September 2003. In September 2006, just before the statute of limitations was about to run out, Mr. Pak filed a complaint in superior court against the owner of the resort. The case was later removed to U.S. District Court. Mr. Pak took little action on the case other than to hire an expert on pools and did not investigate whether the other defendants had liability. By filing the complaint just before the statute expired, Mr. Pak eliminated the possibility of adding additional defendants. He also failed to hire crucial expert witnesses to evaluate economic losses resulting from the sonâ€™s death and the effects of the loss on the clients. On January 4, 2008, while the case was pending, Mr. Pak was suspended from the practice of law for one year based on misconduct in another disciplinary matter. Mr. Pak was informed of the effective date of suspension when he was served with a copy of the Washington Supreme Court order on December 28, 2007. Mr. Pak was required, under ELC 14.3, to file an Affidavit of Compliance with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel within 25 days after being suspended, stating that he had complied with his duties on suspension and notified clients and opposing counsel. Mr. Pak never filed the affidavit. On January 8, 2008, Mr. Pak met with the defendantâ€™s lawyer at the home of the clients to examine documents which had belonged to the decedent, including earnings data and financial records. After reviewing the documents, Mr. Pak and opposing counsel briefly discussed settlement. Mr. Pak did not disclose his suspension to opposing counsel and gave no indication that he was unable to represent the clients. Mr. Pak also never told the clients that he had been suspended, and did not notify the court of his suspension. In April or May 2008, the clients tried to contact Mr. Pak after he received information that opposing counsel wanted to depose him for a second time. Mr. Pak never responded to clientsâ€™ repeated calls and e-mails. On April 17, 2008, defense counsel filed a declaration with the court stating that to his knowledge, Mr. Pak had represented the plaintiffs since the complaint was filed in September 2006, including on January 8, 2008, when Mr. Pak and defense counselâ€™s associate met to discuss the clientsâ€™ case. In his declaration, counsel stated he had recently learned Mr. Pak had been suspended on January 4, 2008, and sought guidance from the court on how to proceed. On April 25, 2008, WSBA opened a grievance against Mr. Pak.In late May 2008, the clients hired a new attorney, who tried repeatedly to contact Mr. Pak to obtain clientâ€™s file, but was unable to reach Mr. Pak and never received the file. On June 18, 2008, WSBA Disciplinary Counsel subpoenaed Mr. Pak to appear and produce documents for a deposition to be held July 1, 2008, to cover the WSBA grievance and another grievance filed in February 2008. Disciplinary counsel informed Mr. Pak that the deposition would be cancelled if he provided the documents requested in the subpoena by June 27, 2008, and if disciplinary counsel confirmed in writing that the response was complete. On June 27, 2008, Mr. Pak delivered documents to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel related to the February 2008 grievance, but did not otherwise respond to either grievance. In a handwritten letter, Mr. Pak requested a continuance of the deposition until the week of July 8, 2008. Because he failed to provide documents or respond to the allegations, disciplinary counsel did not grant Mr. Pakâ€™s request for a continuance and the deposition took place; however, Mr. Pak was given an opportunity to provide a â€œfull and complete responseâ€ to the grievances by July 31, 2008. Mr. Pak did not provide any further response.Mr. Pakâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness; RPC 1.16(d) requiring that, upon termination of representation, a lawyer take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned or incurred; RPC 5.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction; RPC 5.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in the practice of law while on inactive status, or while suspended from the practice of law for any cause; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here ELC 1.5, 5.3(e), 5.3(f), 14.1, 14.2, and 14.3).Kevin M.

1503.html,18051,Colleen Hartl,,Reprimand,6/2/2010,,"Colleen A. Hartl (WSBA No. 18051, admitted 1988), of Federal Way, was ordered to receive a reprimand on June 2, 2010, following approval of a stipulation by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on conduct involving misrepresentation of facts in a disciplinary proceeding and attempting to influence witness testimony.Ms. Hartl was a municipal court judge from May 14, 2007, until December 18, 2007. On December 14, 2007, Ms. Hartl hosted a holiday party at her home, which was attended by several municipal court employees. During the course of the party, Ms. Hartl revealed to a group of court employees that she had a sexual encounter with one of the contract public defenders who frequently appeared before her in court. On December 17, 2007, Ms. Hartl contacted the Commission on Judicial Conduct (Commission) and reported that, at her holiday party for court staff on the preceding Friday, she told some members of her court staff that she had ""gone out for drinks one time"" with one of the public defenders and that ""some flirtation"" had occurred. Ms. Hartl assured the Commission that that was the extent of her disclosure to court employees at her party. Upon further questioning, Ms. Hartl assured the Commission that her relationship with the public defender involved only drinks, flirtation, and some discussion about ""getting together for a date"" in the future. Ms. Hartl unequivocally stated that no further inappropriate activity with the public defender had occurred, and that she had not told staff at the party that anything more than verbal flirtation had taken place.Later in the day on December 17, 2007, Ms. Hartl left a voice message for the municipal court administrator, who was present at the party. In her voice message, Ms. Hartl advised the administrator that she had just contacted the Commission and told them that she and the public defender had gone out for drinks, flirted, talked about dating, and text messages. Ms. Hartl asked the administrator to pass that information along to the other clerks who were present at her party and to let her know if she should ""add to that or if they would support that version.""  On December 18, 2007, Ms. Hartl resigned her position as municipal court judge. The Commission investigated Ms. Hartl's self-reported complaint and, subsequently, served her with a Statement of Allegations on February 8, 2008. It alleged that her submission of facts and details during her telephone call to the Commission was evasive and misleading, and that her message to the former court administrator appeared to be an attempt to influence the statements and testimony of witnesses in Commission proceedings. On March 14, 2008, Ms. Hartl answered the Statement of Allegations and acknowledged that she had sexual contact with a public defender, but denied attempting to induce anyone to be dishonest with the Commission. On August 1, 2008, Ms. Hartl entered into a Stipulation, Agreement and Order of Censure with the Commission. Ms. Hartl was required to appear in person before the Commission, which found that her conduct violated the Code of Judicial Conduct in a manner that detrimentally affects the integrity of the judiciary and undermines public confidence in the administration of justice. A censure is the most severe disciplinary action the Commission can issue without Supreme Court action. There was no evidence that Ms. Hartl's contacts with the public defender resulted in a more favorable outcome to him or his clients. Ms. Hartl's conduct violated RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Debra J.

1505.html,36433,Leylan Greb,,Resignation in Lieu of Disbarment,8/2/2010,,"Leylan Greb (WSBA No. 36433, admitted 2005), of Vancouver, Washington, resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective August 2, 2010. Mr. Greb affirmatively admitted that the WSBA could prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence the alleged violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, and that proof of such violations would suffice to result in disbarment, but did not affirmatively admit the facts and misconduct herein. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to provide competent representation, failure to pursue a clientâ€™s objectives, lack of communication, conflict of interest, and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The Statement of Misconduct reads as follows:On June 2, 2008, client hired Mr. Greb to represent her in a dissolution matter. Clientâ€™s highest priority was to obtain primary custody of the children, who were then residing with her husband, and to enter into an acceptable parenting plan. Client also sought child support, shares of the equity in the family home, the assets of a family business, and her husbandâ€™s pension, and spousal maintenance. A pretrial hearing was scheduled for July 11, 2008, to address custody and child support and to narrow the issues to be resolved at trial. Mr. Greb agreed to cancel this hearing without consulting client. As trial approached, Mr. Greb had not completed discovery; however, he rejected clientâ€™s suggestion that they seek a continuance. Prior to the trial, Mr. Greb had tried only two family law matters and had experienced significant difficulty in obtaining the admission of documentary evidence in each case. In this case, Mr. Greb did not subpoena any witnesses to appear at the trial to authenticate the documents he planned to offer in evidence, although opposing counsel had not agreed to their admissibility. Mr. Greb failed to organize, segregate and properly mark his exhibits in a manner that allowed the court clerk to properly track them in the record. Mr. Greb also appeared unaware of the protocol for offering an exhibit for admission. Of the approximately 30 exhibits he had listed prior to trial, Mr. Greb was able to admit only one into evidence. The court considered that exhibit irrelevant. When faced with opposing counselâ€™s hearsay objections to his exhibits or to the testimony of his witnesses, Mr. Greb frequently was confused and unable to respond, instead abandoning the line of questioning or the exhibit.The family court evaluator assigned to the case had recommended that Mr. Grebâ€™s client be given primary custody of the children. Nevertheless, Mr. Greb did not call the evaluator to testify and presented only scant evidence of clientâ€™s care for her children over the course of the marriage. Clientâ€™s husband had purchased the family home before marriage, and later deeded it to himself and Mr. Grebâ€™s client as community property. Mr. Greb did not make this known to the judge, nor did he offer any evidence to establish his clientâ€™s contribution to this community asset. Rather, he stipulated that the family home was a separate asset belonging to the husband, and did not object to it being awarded to him. Mr. Greb did not request spousal maintenance for his client, and introduced no evidence concerning her income during the marriage. As a result, income was imputed to his client at an amount greater than her actual earnings.After Mr. Greb rested his case, the judge granted opposing counselâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the award of the family home to the husband with no offset. Mr. Greb then made an unsuccessful attempt to reopen his case. At the conclusion of the trial, the judge announced his findings as to property and stated that he would reserve judgment on primary custody, the parenting plan, and child support. At this point, Mr. Greb asked to be allowed to introduce evidence of his clientâ€™s income. His request was denied as untimely.The judge set a hearing for September 5, 2008, to address the remaining issues concerning the children. After the trial concluded, Mr. Greb contacted his malpractice insurer and was advised to withdraw from representation immediately. He filed a Notice of Intent to Withdraw on August 8, 2008, and another attorney appeared for his client; however, the judge did not allow Mr. Greb to withdraw at that point because the judgment rendered orally at the conclusion of the trial had not yet been signed and formally entered. Between the conclusion of trial and the September 5, 2008, hearing, opposing counsel made a settlement offer under which Mr. Grebâ€™s client would receive approximately half of the communityâ€™s equity in the family home and would have the eldest child live with her, while the two younger children would reside with the husband. In his letter proposing the settlement, opposing counsel stated that â€œif a new trial is requestedâ€¦we will be asking the court to award all trial costs including my attorneys fees and our expert witness fees against you [Mr. Greb] personally since your ineffective representation during the first trial is the only basis the court could use to order a second trial.â€ Mr. Greb strongly urged client to resolve the matter by accepting the settlement offer. Ultimately, however, the court found there was no effective written acceptance under CR 2A. On September 5, 2008, the judge signed the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law prepared by opposing counsel and entered a Decree of Dissolution under which Mr. Grebâ€™s client received no interest in the family home, the husbandâ€™s pension or employment benefits, or in the family business, and no maintenance. The judge then recused himself from further involvement in the case, and took no action relating to the unresolved issues relating to the children. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Grebâ€™s client filed a pro se motion to vacate the decree based on Mr. Grebâ€™s ineffective representation. The trial judge referred clientâ€™s motion to another judge while indicating for the record that, were he to decide the motion himself, he would likely have allowed it and, if so, he would have imposed sanctions against Mr. Greb for the opposing counselâ€™s attorney fees. Another judge denied the Motion to Vacate and set a trial date to address the issues of the parenting plan and child support. In the meantime, however, client obtained new counsel who facilitated negotiations under which the parties reached agreement on those issues.Mr. Grebâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to promptly inform the client of any decision of circumstance with respect to which the clientâ€™s informed consent is required, reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the clientâ€™s objectives are to be accomplished, keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyerâ€™s conduct; RPC 1.7(a)(2), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if there is a significant risk that the representation will be materially limited by a personal interest of the lawyer; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Natalea Skvir represented the Bar Association.

1506.html,19165,Michael Hecht,,Disbarment,5/19/2010,,"Michael A. Hecht (WSBA No. 19165, admitted 1989), of Tacoma, was disbarred, effective May 19, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct involving the commission of a crime. Mr. Hecht stipulated to the convictions but did not affirmatively admit the facts and misconduct, and admitted the likelihood that the WSBA could prove by a clear preponderance of evidence sufficient violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct to support disbarment.On February 27, 2009, Mr. Hecht was charged in Superior Court with threatening to cause bodily injury to another man (JH) by threatening to kill him, which is a class C felony. On August 30, 2008, Mr. Hecht threatened JH based on his understanding that JH had been talking about Mr. Hechtâ€™s sexual conduct with JH when JH was a minor. Mr. Hecht screamed at JH: â€œAre you talking about me? You better not be talking about me. Iâ€™ll kill you.â€ On February 27, 2009, Mr. Hecht was also charged in Superior Court with patronizing a prostitute, which is a misdemeanor. On October 28, 2009, a jury found Mr. Hecht guilty of threatening to cause bodily injury to JH by threatening to kill him and of patronizing a prostitute.Mr. Hechtâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or any unjustified act of assault or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law, whether the same be committed in the course of his or her conduct as a lawyer, or otherwise, and whether the same constitutes a felony or misdemeanor or not.Christine Gray represented the Bar Association.

1507.html,31044,Alfoster Garrett,,Suspension,3/24/2010,,"Alfoster Garrett Jr. (WSBA No. 31044, admitted 2001), of Seattle, was suspended for 30 months, effective March 24, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to communicate, failure to deposit client funds into an interest-bearing trust account, failure to maintain complete records of client funds, failure to pay clients funds which they are entitled to receive, and dishonest conduct. The Court also imposed specific conditions on reinstatement.Matter No. 1: In 2002, Mr. Garrett was retained by three clients to represent them in their employment discrimination claims against their common employer, a government agency. At that time, Mr. Garrett was employed as an associate attorney in a law firm, which he was planning to leave in order to open his own solo practice. Representation of the three clients was outside the firmâ€™s practice area and conflicted with his duties to the firm; thus, Mr. Garrett met with the clients outside of work hours. Mr. Garrett orally informed two of the clients, Ms. C and Ms. G, that payment for his legal services would occur on a contingent-fee basis, but failed to communicate how the fees would be calculated. The third client, Ms. R, was not informed of the contingent nature of Mr. Garrettâ€™s fee until after settlement was obtained. Mr. Garrett did not have a written fee agreement with any of the three clients. Each client gave Mr. Garrett $50 for costs to be incurred in their claims, with which he opened a general office account for a small business at a bank. Mr. Garrett referred to the account as his â€œclient account,â€ and instructed the three clients to deposit money for costs into the account. He did not maintain complete records of client funds in the account nor render to the clients accountings of those funds. Instead, he relied on the bank to provide information of the accountâ€™s status and required each client to maintain deposit information. In December 2002, Mr. Garrett signed a WSBA â€œTrust Account Declaration,â€ in which he denied maintaining any Washington individual (non-IOLTA) trust account.On the same day Mr. Garrett opened the business account, he filed a lawsuit in superior court on behalf of the three clients. Mr. Garrett did not file a tort claim with respect to the clients prior to filing the civil suit action, which is a requisite against a governmental entity. Mr. Garrett litigated each of the clientsâ€™ claims individually. Following Mr. Garrettâ€™s instructions, Ms. R deposited $150 into the client account on March 15, 2003. Ms. Râ€™s claim settled for $3,500. In a letter dated December 3, 2003, Mr. Garrett informed Ms. R that he would disburse the settlement proceeds, including paying for deposition costs. Mr. Garrett failed to pay the court reporter her fee for the deposition transcript until July 2007, and Ms. R did not receive the $150 she earlier deposited into his account until January 2007. Mr. Garrett was unable to account for the $150 deposited by Ms. R or the $677.75 he withheld for deposition costs from settlement proceeds. This money became commingled with other funds, some of which Mr. Garrett withdrew for his own purposes. Ms. Gâ€™s claim was dismissed in October of 2003. Without informing his client, Mr. Garrett initially signed a voluntary withdrawal of Ms. Gâ€™s claims. He subsequently signed a dismissal with prejudice and, in December 2003, an order of dismissal prepared by defense counsel. Copies of documents related to the voluntary withdrawal and dismissals were not provided to Ms. G. In a letter to her on December 2, 2003, and in a subsequent phone conversation, Mr. Garrett told Ms. G that her claim was dismissed, but misrepresented the nature of the dismissal or that he had agreed to a dismissal with prejudice.In 2003, the employer moved for summary judgment against Ms. Câ€™s claim because of the failure to file a tort claim before the start of a civil action. Faced with that motion, Mr. Garrett dismissed by â€œnonsuitâ€ the claim of Ms. C, and filed a tort claim. The employer offered to settle the claim by payment of $10,000 to Ms. C, but the offer was rejected at Ms. Câ€™s direction. Another civil action on behalf of Ms. C was then filed on May 4, 2004. This action was dismissed because of improper form and service of the tort claim. While the dismissal was without prejudice, the applicable limitation period had expired. Matter No. 2: Mr. Garrett was retained in March 2005 to represent a minor in school expulsion and juvenile court criminal proceedings. At his juvenile court trial in July 2005, the minor client was convicted on two of the three counts of assault in the fourth degree with sexual motivation. The clientâ€™s mother was dissatisfied with Mr. Garrettâ€™s representation and discharged him by letter, dated August 2, 2005. She filed a grievance with the WSBA about Mr. Garrett on August 4, 2005.When he was retained, Mr. Garrett provided the minor clientâ€™s mother with his business card, one side of which identified Mr. Garrett as president of the local chapter of a prominent civil rights organization. After discharging Mr. Garrett, the clientâ€™s mother attended a meeting of that organization, wrote letters to the organizationâ€™s legal department, and wrote to a prominent local civil rights activist in order to complain about Mr. Garrett. By August 2005, the organization was highly factionalized, with one side supporting Mr. Garrett. A local radio station provided a forum for the factions to each voice their positions. On August 12, 2005, Mr. Garrett took part in a live radio broadcast, during which he mentioned the full name of his minor client. After Bar disciplinary counsel contacted Mr. Garrett later in 2005 regarding the propriety of mentioning the full name of the minor client, Mr. Garrett denied having called into the live broadcast and falsely represented to the Association that the programâ€™s host played a â€œCD of a prior conversation...â€ Mr. Garrett also wrote to Bar Association disciplinary counsel, in which he made these same misrepresentations. Matter No. 3: In January 2005, Mr. Garrett was retained by a local group (the Alliance) whose members were concerned about portions of a proposed city ordinance. Mr. Garrett was requested to write a letter to the mayor regarding the membersâ€™ concerns and discussed the possibility of a civil action to enjoin the ordinance provisions. Mr. Garrett requested payment of a deposit for fees to be incurred, which would accrue at the rate of $200 per hour. He estimated he might require about one hour of professional time to produce the letter. The Allianceâ€™s director made a payment of $400 and, in his transmittal letter to Mr. Garrett, directed that the check be placed in a lawyer trust account and that Mr. Garrett â€œnot do any more work for us until we come up with your retainer and/or agreed deposit you require.â€ The check for $400 was deposited into the business account previously identified. On February 24, 2005, the Allianceâ€™s director sent Mr. Garrett a check for $800 and authorized him to write a letter to the mayor. The check was deposited into Mr. Garrettâ€™s business account. An implied fee agreement was formed on the basis of the directorâ€™s letters to Mr. Garrett. Mr. Garrett wrote to the mayor on March 28, 2005, but did not copy the letter to anyone in the Alliance.The ordinance went into effect in early April 2005. Because the Alliance and its director believed that Mr. Garrett did not write the mayor, the director requested a refund of the $1,200 previously paid to Mr. Garrett. On April 15, 2005, Mr. Garrett denied the request for a refund in a letter, in which also enclosed a copy of Mr. Garrettâ€™s March 28, 2005, letter to the mayor. The mayor, reacting to Mr. Garrettâ€™s letter, did agree to seek amendment of the ordinance. On July 18, 2005, City Council voted to amend the ordinance. This news was conveyed to Mr. Garrett in a letter from the Allianceâ€™s director, dated July 20, 2005, in which he also requested Mr. Garrettâ€™s assistance for a member of the Alliance. On August 4, 2005, the Allianceâ€™s director wrote to Mr. Garrett that his services were terminated and sought a refund of $600. Mr. Garrett did not provide the requested refund or provide the Alliance with an accounting or a billing; nor did he keep check registers or a running balance with respect to his client account or the Allianceâ€™s funds. While Mr. Garrett was able to reconstruct his time providing professional services to the Alliance, he did not do that until late 2008.Mr. Garrettâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; former RPC 1.5(b), requiring the lawyer, when he has not regularly represented the client, to communicate the basis or rate of the fee or factors involved in determining the charges for legal services and the lawyerâ€™s billing practices to the client, preferably in writing, within a reasonable time after commencing representation; former RPC 1.5(c)(1), requiring that a contingent fee agreement be in a writing and state the method by which the fee is to be determined; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited into one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and no funds of the lawyer be deposited therein; former RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; former RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by a client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive; former RPC 1.14(c), requiring lawyers to maintain interest-bearing trust accounts pursuant to the Rules and pay the interest to the Legal Foundation of Washington; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Marsha A.

1509.html,20509,Tom Hyde,,Reprimand,7/9/2010,,"Tom Steven Hyde (WSBA No. 20509, admitted 1991), of Everett, received a reprimand following approval of a stipulation by order of the hearing officer on July 9, 2010. This discipline is based on conduct involving trust account irregularities. Tom Steven Hyde is to be distinguished from Thomas C. Hyde of Wichita, Kansas.On September 4, 2007, Mr. Hyde wrote two checks from his trust account. Mr. Hydeâ€™s bank sent the Bar Association a Trust Account Overdraft Notice notifying the Association that the two checks had been returned for insufficient funds. One of the checks was returned by the bank a second time and the bank sent the Association another overdraft notice. Mr. Hyde wrote the two checks to pay court filing fees for clients who had paid Mr. Hyde filing fee advances. At the time he wrote the checks, the two clientsâ€™ fee advances had already been disbursed by Mr. Hyde and used to pay fees or expenses of other clients or to pay Mr. Hyde.After receiving the overdraft notices, the Association opened a grievance, requested information from Mr. Hyde, and audited Mr. Hydeâ€™s trust account for the period between July 1, 2007, through March 31, 2008. During the audit period, Mr. Hyde kept trust account records in the form of a handwritten check register and a Quicken deposit register. The audit revealed Mr. Hyde had failed to record in his registers all bank fee payments and transfer withdrawals; failed to pay bank fees and other costs assessed by the bank against the trust account; failed to enter some deposits in his Quicken deposit register and incorrectly entered the amounts of other deposits; failed to keep a running account balance after each transaction in the trust account; failed to maintain individual client ledgers; failed to reconcile his check register balance to his bank statement balance and to the combined total of all client ledger records; and failed to maintain all client funds in trust, resulting in a shortage of client funds in trust continuous throughout the audit period. The shortage resulted from Mr. Hydeâ€™s payment of attorney fees to himself in excess of funds available for that purpose, his payment of funds from trust on behalf of clients in excess of funds on deposit for those clients, and his failure to pay bank fees with his own funds. Mr. Hyde did not intentionally misappropriate client funds for the use of himself or others. The shortage was the result of inadequate record-keeping and the accumulation of small errors over a period of time. On May 4, 2009, after the audit period described above, the bank sent the Association another trust account overdraft notice notifying the Association that a check drawn on Mr. Hydeâ€™s trust account had been returned for insufficient funds. Mr. Hyde had written a check on April 27, 2009, to pay a $20 ex parte fee on behalf of a client. The balance in Mr. Hydeâ€™s trust account was $18.30. At the time he wrote the check, Mr. Hyde had deposited the clientâ€™s advance payment in his trust account and it had been collected by the bank. Mr. Hyde had already disbursed a small portion of the clientâ€™s filing fee advance from trust and there were insufficient funds of other clients in the account. The same check was presented again on May 6, 2009, and the check cleared. The shortage was the result of a small error. Subsequent review of Mr. Hydeâ€™s trust-account records by the Association auditor indicated that, after the audit period, Mr. Hyde was still not maintaining adequate client ledgers or properly reconciling his check register balance to his bank statement balance and to the combined total of all client ledger records. From the beginning of the audit period, July 1, 2007, through December 31, 2009, Mr. Hyde had identified $4,162.00 that he had deposited in his trust account as client advances for filing fees. Mr. Hydeâ€™s trust-account records did not properly account for the use to which those funds were put.Mr. Hydeâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.15A(b), prohibiting a lawyer from using, converting, borrowing, or pledging client or third-person property for the lawyerâ€™s own use; RPC 1.15A(c)(1), requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients and third persons separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property and to deposit and hold in a trust account funds subject to the rule pursuant the rule; RPC 1.15A(h)(2), requiring a lawyer to keep complete trust-account records as required by Rule 1.15B; RPC 1.15A(h)(6), requiring trust-account records to be reconciled as often as bank statements are generated or at least quarterly, and requiring the lawyer to reconcile the check register balance to the bank statement balance and the check register balance to the combined total of all client ledger records as required by Rule 1.15B(a)(2); RPC 1.15A(h)(8), prohibiting disbursements on behalf of a client or third person from exceeding the funds of that person on deposit, and prohibiting funds of a client or third person from being used on behalf of anyone else; RPC1.15A(i)(1), requiring that when client or third-person funds will not produce a positive net return to the client or third person, the funds must be placed in an IOLTA; and RPC 1.15B(a), requiring a lawyer to maintain current trust-account records, in electronic or manual form, requiring the records to be retained for at least seven years after the events they record, and setting out the minimum requirements for maintenance of the records.

This discipline is based on conduct involving the commission of a felony.On August 20, 2009, law enforcement officers executed a search warrant at the location which serves as both Mr. Yarbrough's law office and residence. During the search, they seized approximately 75 grams of harvested marijuana plants, along with other marijuana plants. That same day, Mr. Yarbrough was arrested. On November 20, 2009, the prosecuting attorney filed a criminal information against Mr. Yarbrough, accusing him of the unlawful manufacture and possession of a controlled substance in violation of RCW 69.50.401(1)(2)(c). This offense is a class-C felony. RCW 69.50.401(1)(2)(c).

1518.html,16194,Richard Shepard,,Suspension,9/9/2010,,"Richard Dale Shepard (WSBA No. 16194, admitted 1986), of Tacoma, was suspended for two  years, effective September 9, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to act diligently in representing a client, failure to communicate, conflicts of interest, and the unauthorized practice of law. For further information, see In re Shepard __ Wn.2d __, 239 P.3d 1066 (2010).In 2003, Mr. Shepard, a solo practitioner, agreed to enter into a business arrangement with Mr. C, who intended to sell living trusts in Washington. Under the proposed agreement, clients who purchased a living trust package from Mr. C would be referred to Mr. Shepard for legal services relating to those trusts. Mr. C would independently market and sell the trusts and would arrange to have each purchaser sign a fee agreement with Mr. Shepard. The fee agreement required clients to pay Mr. Shepard a flat fee of $200 in exchange for his agreement to independently review and make recommendations regarding each clientâ€™s estate-planning needs. Mr. C informed Mr. Shepard that he was not a lawyer. He told him he was a â€œcertified estate planner,â€ but did not mention that he had been previously convicted in California for selling fraudulent insurance products. After affiliating with Mr. Shepard, Mr. C began selling living trusts to seniors. Many of the prospective clients did not understand the differences between various estate-planning options. Much of the information provided by Mr. C was either inaccurate or misleading. In particular, Mr. C exaggerated the costs and difficulty of probating an estate in Washington. Many clients were sold trusts that they did not need without being fully informed on how the trusts worked. Mr. Shepard never accompanied Mr. C on these sales visits. As part of Mr. Câ€™s sales pitch, prospective clients were told that an attorney would review the estate-planning documents and were presented with the previously mentioned attorney-client fee agreement. Both the trust packages sold by Mr. C and Mr. Shepardâ€™s fee agreements were generated by ATDS, a third-party contract paralegal service. Upon agreement with Mr. C to purchase a living trust package, clients were asked to fill out a questionnaire that included the clientâ€™s assets and beneficiary information. The questionnaire was then sent to ATDS, which would generate the trust documents and a short table summarizing the clientâ€™s answers on the questionnaire. These documents were forwarded to Mr. Shepard, but Mr. Shepard did not carefully review them. Mr. Shepard simply called his clients to verify the information provided in the questionnaire was accurate. Once the information was verified, the trust packages were forwarded to Mr. C, who delivered them to the clients along with a form letter written by Mr. Shepard explaining how to execute the trusts. When the trusts were finally delivered, Mr. Shepard considered his job complete and never followed up with any of his clients to ensure that the trust documents were executed correctly.Mr. Shepard did not provide the services promised in his fee agreement, never discussed with his clients their estate-planning needs, and did not review the clientsâ€™ assets to determine an appropriate estate-planning strategy. During the brief telephone calls he did make to clients, Mr. Shepard never disclosed that he had an ongoing business relationship with Mr. C which might give rise to a conflict of interest. In all, Mr. Shepard represented more than 70 clients and received $200 for each one.Although many of the living trust package purchasers were couples, Mr. Shepard often spoke to only one spouse over the phone. He sometimes made notes during the calls about concerns he had regarding clientsâ€™ competency. In one instance, one of Mr. Shepardâ€™s clients specifically notified Mr. Shepard that his wife was incompetent to execute a trust. Although Mr. Shepardâ€™s fee agreement stated that an in-office consultation was required if undue influence or incapacity issues appeared possible, Mr. Shepard made no effort to investigate the accuracy of the information and did not require the couple to come to his office to speak with him. The husband signed the trust documents for his wife using a previously executed power of attorney that specifically prohibited his revoking or changing any estate-planning or testamentary documents for his wife. Mr. Shepard did not discuss the prior power of attorney with the couple, and as a result the trusts they purchased and attempted to execute were legally invalid.At some point in 2003, Mr. Shepard was introduced to Mr. Câ€™s brother, an insurance agent who worked with Mr. C offering insurance products to clients who purchased trust packages. Mr. C and Mr. Câ€™s wife and brother intended to use the personal and financial information obtained through the sale of the trust packages to sell annuities and reverse mortgages to clients through fraudulent means. Many clients who purchased the trust packages were pressured into purchasing these insurance products, most of which were eventually canceled and the premiums returned after intervention by the Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC). Around March 2004, Mr. Shepard was contacted by Ms. P, the daughter of two of his clients, who informed Mr. Shepard that her parents were not competent to execute the trust documents. Ms. Pâ€™s mother had Alzheimerâ€™s disease and her father was bedridden. She was concerned that the documents they had signed were not executed properly, which turned out to be correct. Ms. P also informed Mr. Shepard that, in addition to the trust package her parents had purchased, Mr. C had attempted to sell her parents both an annuity and a reverse mortgage. Mr. Shepard spoke with Mr. C about his conversation with Ms. P, but made no changes with regard to the way the trusts or insurance products were sold. In February 2005, Mr. Shepard was contacted by an OIC investigator. OIC had received an anonymous letter expressing concern that Mr. C and his wife, along with two other individuals, were running a living trust mill. OIC informed Mr. Shepard of their investigation of Mr. C and his wife for their role in selling insurance products to seniors and told Mr. Shepard about Mr. Câ€™s prior felony conviction in California. Despite this information, Mr. Shepard continued to accept clients referred to him by Mr. C well into 2005. The OIC informed both the Bar Association and the Attorney Generalâ€™s Office about their concerns regarding Mr. and Mrs. C, their business, and Mr. Shepard. The Bar began investigating Shepardâ€™s role in the scheme. In response to the ongoing investigations, Mr. Shepard initiated efforts to mitigate problems with his conduct. He sent letters to his clients urging them to make an appointment with him to review their trust documents and informed clients of the investigations. Mr. Shepherdâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after a consultation and a full disclosure of the material facts; RPC 5.3(a) requiring a partner in a law firm, with respect to a nonlawyer associated with a lawyer, to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that the personâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; and RPC 5.5(b), prohibiting a lawyer from assisting a person who is not a member of the Bar in the performance of activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.Kevin M.

1519.html,13147,David Knodel,,Suspension,9/9/2010,,"David B. Knodel (WSBA No. 13147, admitted 1983), of Tacoma, was suspended for 18 months, effective September 9, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to act diligently, failure to communicate, and misrepresentations.In 2006, four beneficiaries of a trust hired Mr. Knodel to represent them in a lawsuit against the trustee for failing to collect interest related to the sale of trust real estate during the periods that the purchaser was in default. Although he had done nothing to advance the beneficiaries' claim from March 2008 through January 2009, Mr. Knodel misrepresented to Beneficiary A that he was diligently handling the claim and that he had sent a demand letter to the trustee, who had rejected the trust's offer to settle the suit through a payment of $150,000. In spring 2008, Mr. Knodel forwarded a draft complaint to Beneficiary A. In October 2008, knowing that the statute of limitations for filing suit against the trustee had expired in February 2008, Mr. Knodel misrepresented to Beneficiary A that a complaint had been timely filed and served when, in fact, he had neither filed suit nor attempted to serve the trustee. In November and December 2008, Mr. Knodel misrepresented to Beneficiary A that the attorney for the trustee had made offers to settle the case. In January 2009, after learning that two other trust beneficiaries had received ""settlement draws"" of $4,000 each from Mr. Knodel, Beneficiary A contacted the trustee and learned that no complaint had been served on him and that Mr. Knodel had not spoken to him since February 2007. When she confronted Mr. Knodel, he admitted that he had not filed suit, and that he paid ""draws"" to the other beneficiaries from his personal funds. Mr. Knodel negotiated settlements for his failure to timely file suit with three beneficiaries for $15,000 each. Mr. Knodel has paid one beneficiary in full, and owes $4,900 combined to the other two beneficiaries. Beneficiary A has hired a lawyer to pursue a civil action against Mr. Knodel.Mr. Knodel's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to promptly inform the client of any decision of circumstance with respect to which the client's informed consent is required, to reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the client's objectives are to be accomplished, to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and to consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyer's conduct; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Kathleen A.T.

Anderson (WSBA No. 4016, admitted 1963), of Pierce County, has been suspended for two years, following a stipulation, by order of the Supreme Court dated May 4, 2000. The discipline is based upon his violation of Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct.On January 8, 1993, Mr. Anderson was sworn in as a judge in Pierce County Superior Court. In March 1996, the Bar Association commenced an investigation related to Mr. Andersonâ€™s actions as personal representative for the estate of Charles Hoffman. Following an investigation, disciplinary counsel dismissed the matter on the grounds that insufficient evidence existed to establish a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. On August 4, 1997, the Commission on Judicial Conduct filed a Statement of Charges against Mr. Anderson. On April 3, 1998, the Commission on Judicial Conduct filed its decision, dismissing four counts and finding violations of CJC Canons 1, 2(A), 5(C)(3) and 6(C) by his continuing to serve as president of the estateâ€™s corporations through October 1993, after he had been sworn in as a superior court judge; failing to disclose to the trustee of the trust formed after the estate closed, that he was receiving compensation in the form of car payments from the purchaser of an estate asset, while the price for the asset was being negotiated; and failing to report his receipt of the car payments on his public disclosure filings for 1993, 1994 and 1995.The Commission recommended that Mr. Anderson receive a censure and a four-month suspension, attend a course in judicial ethics, and amend his public disclosure filings. On May 12, 1999, in light of the Commissionâ€™s decision, the Bar Association reopened its investigation. On July 29, 1999, the Supreme Court upheld the Commissionâ€™s decision and increased the sanction to removal from office. By violating Canons 1, 2(A), 5(C)(3) and 6(C) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Mr. Anderson is subject to discipline pursuant to RLD 1.1(k).Disciplinary Counsel Douglas Ende represented the Bar Association.

1521.html,22272,Rick Klessig,,Suspension,9/20/2010,,"Rick William Klessig (WSBA No. 22272, admitted 1992), of Olympia, was suspended for two years, effective September 20, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to communicate, failure to provide a written accounting of client funds, withholding client property, trust account irregularities, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and violations of the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct. The suspension will be followed by two yearsâ€™ probation upon reinstatement.In April 2005, Mr. Klessig agreed to represent a client in litigation concerning a commercial lease. Client made an initial payment of $1,500 and additional payments thereafter. Even though Mr. Klessigâ€™s fee agreement provided that a monthly detailed accounting would be sent, and the client made specific requests to receive such an accounting, Mr. Klessig provided only sporadic statements. The trial in the clientâ€™s case was set for December 7, 2006. In response to a demand from Mr. Klessig, the client provided an additional $1,500 fee deposit in November 2006. Mr. Klessig failed to provide the client with a statement reflecting that payment until September 2007. Mr. Klessig told the client that the case would probably settle. On December 5, 2006, the trial date was stricken because the parties were working out the details of a settlement. On April 12, 2007, the court entered a Stipulated Order of Dismissal with Prejudice. Mr. Klessig did not notify the client of the dismissal. Between September 2007 and November 2007, the client made a written request to Mr. Klessig for a refund of the November 2006 payment and left him multiple voice-mail messages. On November 6, 2007, the client received a voice-mail message from Mr. Klessigâ€™s legal assistant stating that the account was being reviewed. Having heard nothing more, the client made another written request for a refund on November 26, 2007, adding that she might â€œseek assistance from the Washington State Bar Association.â€ Shortly thereafter, the client received a check from Mr. Klessig in the amount of $1,036.47 and a statement dated October 20, 2007. That was the first statement sent to the client since September 2006. The statement showed a balance of $1,036.47 as of December 20, 2006 and no indication of any work performed after December 20, 2006. On December 7, 2007, the client spoke with Mr. Klessig and questioned the amount of the refund. Mr. Klessig told her that he needed time to review her account and that he would contact her after he did. In January 2008, having heard nothing more from Mr. Klessigâ€™s office, the client filed a grievance. In response to the grievance, Mr. Klessig stated in writing that he would send the client a check for $463.53 to resolve their dispute, which he did on March 10, 2008. In June 2008, disciplinary counsel sent Mr. Klessig an Additional Request for Response to Grievance. Disciplinary counsel asked that Mr. Klessig explain what work was done on the clientâ€™s case after November 1, 2006, and why the balance of the clientâ€™s November 2006 payment was not refunded before November 29, 2007. Disciplinary counsel also asked Mr. Klessig to provide certain billing and trust account records related to the grievance. Mr. Klessig did not respond. After receiving a second notice in June 2008, Mr. Klessig telephoned the client to ask her to withdraw her grievance. He also telephoned disciplinary counsel to tell him that he had not received the June 2008 Additional Request for Response to Grievance and that he thought the grievance was closed. Disciplinary counsel told Mr. Klessig that the grievance was not closed and sent him additional copies of the Additional Request for Response to Grievance. In spite of multiple requests from disciplinary counsel, Mr. Klessig failed to provide a complete response to requests for records and information.Mr. Klessigâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4(a)(3), requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter; RPC 1.15A(d), requiring a lawyer to promptly notify a client or third person of receipt of the client or third personâ€™s property; RPC 1.15A(e), requiring a lawyer to promptly provide a written accounting to a client upon request and to provide at least annually a written accounting to a client for whom the lawyer is holding funds; RPC 1.15A(f), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client the property which the client is entitled to receive; RPC 1.15A(h)(2), requiring a lawyer to keep complete trust account records; RPC 1.15A(h)(6), requiring a lawyer to reconcile trust account records as often as bank statements are generated or at least quarterly and to reconcile the check register balance to the bank statement balance and reconcile the check register balance to the combined total of all client ledger records; RPC 1.15A(h)(8), prohibiting disbursements on behalf of a client or third person from exceeding the funds of that person on deposit; former RPC 1.14(b)(3) and current RPC 1.15B, requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Scott G.

1523.html,18398,Mark Schneider,,Disbarment,9/17/2010,,"Mark Alan Schneider (WSBA No. 18398, admitted 1988), of Tacoma, was disbarred, effective September 17, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to abide by a clientâ€™s decision concerning the objectives of representation, conversion of client funds, the commission of a criminal act, and dishonesty. Mark Alan Schneider is to be distinguished from Mark William Schneider, of Seattle, and Mark Alan Schneider, of Bellevue.In November 2004, a client hired Mr. Â¬Schneider to represent her in a personal injury claim related to injuries sustained in an automobile accident. On August 22, 2006, the client died of causes unrelated to the accident. At the time of her death, the clientâ€™s personal injury claims were outstanding and no suit had been filed. On April 2, 2007, knowing the client had died, and without the permission of the clientâ€™s daughter and personal representative, Mr. Schneider settled the clientâ€™s claim and received a settlement draft in the amount of $35,000. At Mr. Schneiderâ€™s request, the insurer made the draft payable to Mr. Schneiderâ€™s IOLTA account. On April 10, 2007, Mr. Schneider endorsed the draft and deposited the money into his IOLTA account. Mr. Schneider did not tell the attorney for the clientâ€™s estate (Attorney B) or the clientâ€™s family that he had settled the case and received settlement funds. Ten months later, in February 2008, Attorney B learned of the settlement. He told Mr. Schneider to prepare an accounting and deliver the settlement funds to him. Mr. Schneider misrepresented to Attorney B that the clientâ€™s daughter had authorized him to settle the case and to receive the settlement funds. Although he assured Attorney B that he would deliver the funds to him, Mr. Schneider did not do so. Over the next year, Attorney B repeatedly told Mr. Schneider that the settlement funds were the property of the clientâ€™s estate and that he must deliver the funds to the estate, which Mr. Schneider failed to do. Mr. Schneiderâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and to consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; RPC 1.15A(b), prohibiting a lawyer from using, converting, borrowing, or pledging client or third-person property for the lawyerâ€™s own use; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Kathleen A.T.

1527.html,16854,Georgina Sierra,,Reprimand,8/28/2010,,"Georgina D. Sierra (WSBA No. 16854, admitted 1987), of Redmond, stipulated to two reprimands, followed by two-year probation, approved by order of the hearing officer on August 28, 2010. This discipline was based on trust account irregularities, failure to properly supervise a non-lawyer assistant, and failure to cooperate during a Bar Association investigation. Ms. Sierra stipulated to the discipline without affirmatively admitting the facts and misconduct herein.In February 2007, the Association began conducting a random examination of Ms. Sierraâ€™s trust account. Ms. Sierra did not respond to the Bar Association auditorâ€™s request to schedule an appointment. Between March and August 2007, the auditor tried repeatedly to schedule an appointment with Ms. Sierraâ€™s then-law office manager to begin the random examination. Ms. Sierraâ€™s law office manager asked repeatedly for delays. At an August 15, 2007, meeting with Ms. Sierra, the auditor examined her trust account records. Because the records were incomplete, Ms. Sierra and the auditor agreed that an outside bookkeeper recently hired by Ms. Sierra should be given an opportunity to complete her ongoing organization of the records. After receiving the bookkeeperâ€™s completed work, the auditor requested further information. In subsequent telephone calls and correspondence, Ms. Sierra did not provide the auditor with all the information requested. Based in part on her failure to cooperate, the auditor recommended an investigation of Ms. Sierraâ€™s trust account practices.On May 20, 2008, Ms. Sierra was deposed by Disciplinary Counsel regarding the Associationâ€™s investigation of her trust account practices. Ms. Sierra produced some of the information subpoenaed for the deposition, but not all of it. Much of the information subpoenaed for the deposition had previously been requested by the auditor. On August 5, 2008, another Association auditor wrote a letter to Ms. Sierraâ€™s counsel requesting further documents relating to her trust account practices from 2006 onwards. Ms. Sierra did not provide the requested documents despite repeated requests. The Association issued a subpoena duces tecum for Ms. Sierraâ€™s deposition because she had failed to cooperate. At the deposition, or shortly after, she provided the previously requested documents.An audit of Ms. Sierraâ€™s trust account records was completed on October 28, 2009, covering two time periods: one during which her law office manager maintained her trust account records and the other during which Ms. Sierra personally maintained her trust account records. During both periods, Ms. Sierra did not maintain adequate records, did not reconcile her trust account bank statements with her trust account check register, and did not reconcile her trust account bank statements with the combined total of all client ledgers. When Ms. Sierraâ€™s law office manager maintained her account, Ms. Sierra delegated all aspects of her law practice, including management of the trust account, to him. Although Ms. Sierra was the only person with signing authority on the account, her law office manager would prepare checks for her to sign. During this period, Ms. Sierra frequently had shortages in her trust account. She used funds of clients with positive balances on behalf of other clients with negative balances to cover the shortages. Ms. Sierra also disbursed funds to herself that could not be identified to specific clients. When Ms. Sierra personally maintained the account, she overdrew it on one occasion. Ms. Sierraâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.14 and current RPC 1.15A(c)(1), requiring that all funds of a client paid to a lawyer be deposited into an identifiable interest-bearing trust account and that no funds belonging to the lawyer be deposited therein except as permitted by rule; RPC 1.15A(h)(2), requiring a lawyer to keep complete records of his trust account; RPC 1.15A(h)(6), requiring trust account records to be reconciled as often as bank statements are generated or at least quarterly and requiring the lawyer to reconcile the check register balance to the bank statement balance and to the combined total of all client ledger records; RPC 1.15A(h)(8), prohibiting trust account disbursements on behalf of a client or third person from exceeding the funds of that person on deposit and prohibiting the funds of a client or third person from being used on behalf of anyone else; RPC 5.3(b), requiring a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over a non-lawyer make reasonable efforts to ensure that the non-lawyerâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter (here, ELC 5.3(e) and ELC 15.2).Kevin M.

This discipline was based on conduct in two matters involving failure to act diligently and failure to communicate.Matter No. 1: Mr. Gomes represented Client A in a contentious child custody and support modification matter. Client A became embroiled in a dispute with her ex-husband as to whether she would deliver the children to him, or whether he would pick up the children at her house. After opposing counsel faxed Mr. Gomes notice of a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to be heard the following morning at the courtâ€™s ex parte calendar if Client A did not deliver the children to her ex-husband that evening, Mr. Gomes made no attempts to inform Client A of opposing counselâ€™s motion and failed to appear at the following morningâ€™s ex parte calendar to oppose the motion. As a result, the court granted the request for a TRO and assessed $1,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees against Client A. Matter No. 2: After appearing in a dissolution matter on behalf of Client B, Mr. Gomes failed to respond to opposing counselâ€™s letters and telephone calls concerning pretrial and discovery matters. Mr. Gomes failed to respond to discovery requests or to appear for a hearing on opposing counselâ€™s motion for discovery. He further failed to respond to opposing counselâ€™s attempts to set a CR 26(i) conference to resolve discovery issues or to a motion to compel interrogatory answers. After the court granted opposing counselâ€™s motion to compel, Mr. Gomes continued to fail to produce the interrogatory answers. When Mr. Gomes appeared for Client Bâ€™s dissolution trial, the judge refused to allow Mr. Gomes to put on evidence and granted all of the relief sought by the opposing party because of his failure to comply with discovery. Subsequently Mr. Gomes filed an appeal, which was dismissed by the Court of Appeals as being untimely.Mr. Gomesâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; and RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to promptly inform the client of any decision of circumstance with respect to which the clientâ€™s informed consent required by these Rules, reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the clientâ€™s objectives are to be accomplished, keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyerâ€™s conduct when the client expects assistance not permitted by the Rules or other law, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.

1531.html,6098,Peter Moote,,Resignation in Lieu of Disbarment,11/8/2010,,"Peter Moote (WSBA No. 6098, admitted 1975), of Freeland, resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective November 8, 2010. Mr. Moote affirmatively admitted that the WSBA could prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence the alleged violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, and that proof of such violations would suffice to result in disbarment, but did not affirmatively admit the facts and misconduct herein. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to act diligently, failure to communicate, conversion of client funds, filing false documents with the court, misrepresentations to a tribunal, the commission of criminal acts, and fraud. The Statement of Misconduct reads as follows:Client A: From May 2004 until March 2010, Mr. Moote represented Client A in personal injury claims against a third-party insurer (TPI) and against Client Aâ€™s underinsured motorist coverage (UIM) carrier. The claims arose following an auto accident in May 2001. In August 2005, without her knowledge or permission, Mr. Moote settled Client Aâ€™s claim against TPI for $85,000 and dismissed her suit. He never informed Client A of the settlement or of his receipt of her settlement check and documents. On August 22, 2005, Mr. Moote received two settlement checks from TPI: one for $28,333.05, representing his fee, and one for $56,666.05, payable to Client A and representing her share of the settlement money. Mr. Moote forged Client Aâ€™s signature to her settlement check, deposited the check into an account other than his IOLTA account, and converted Client Aâ€™s money for his own use.On July 28, 2005, Mr. Moote notified Client Aâ€™s UIM carrier that damages to Client A exceeded $85,000, and that Client A would pursue her claim against them. During the next five years Mr. Moote repeatedly misrepresented to Client A that he was in contact with her UIM carrier and attempting to schedule an arbitration to decide her claim when in fact he had no further contact with the UIM carrier about her claim.  In March 2010, knowing that no UIM arbitration had taken place, Mr. Moote misrepresented the status of the UIM claim to Client A and to the King County Superior Court, and attempted to defraud the UIM carrier. Mr. Moote fabricated and filed with the court three false UIM arbitration decisions and orders attached to three Petitions For Judicial Review seeking a determination of bad faith by the UIM carrier. When Client A was injured in a second accident in April 2006, Mr. Moote told her that he would represent her in that matter. After he made preliminary contacts with the third-party insurer, however, Mr. Moote failed to pursue Client Aâ€™s claim and allowed the statute of limitations on her claim to expire, precluding Client A from receiving compensation for her injuries.Client B: From February 2005 until April 2010, Mr. Moote represented Client B in her personal injury claim arising from an accident in November 2004 at a Country Club. In August 2009, at a mediation to resolve Client Bâ€™s case, the parties agreed to settle Client Bâ€™s claims for $100,000. On August 17, 2009, the Country Clubâ€™s attorneys finalized the settlement by mailing Mr. Moote a check for $100,000, settlement and release documents, and an order of dismissal of Client Bâ€™s suit. Mr. Moote failed to notify Client B of the receipt of the check and documents or that the case had been finally settled. Without Client Bâ€™s knowledge and permission, Mr. Moote deposited Client Bâ€™s settlement check into his IOLTA account, and, within days of its receipt, converted Client Bâ€™s share of the money to himself for his own use. During fall and winter 2009, Mr. Moote did not return Client Bâ€™s numerous telephone messages or answer her letters requesting the status of the personal injury settlement and legal materials. He also failed to provide her with documents or to inform her about the status of her case. Client Bâ€™s suit was dismissed by the Superior Court on November 17, 2009, for lack of activity.On November 2, 2009, and December 22, 2009, Mr. Moote sent Client B two checks totaling $15,000 that he claimed were partial payments to Client B of settlement funds owed to her. Mr. Moote misrepresented to Client B that he could not distribute the remainder of the settlement money owed to her until he had satisfied non-existent medical liens. On February 18, 2010, knowing he had converted all of the settlement funds, Mr. Moote prepared and sent Client B a fraudulent IOLTA accounting sheet misrepresenting to her that almost $83,000 of Client Bâ€™s settlement funds remained in his IOLTA account. Mr. Moote owes Client B $49,000.Mr. Mooteâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.15A(b), prohibiting a lawyer from using, converting, borrowing, or pledging client or third-person property for the lawyerâ€™s own use; RPC 3.1, prohibiting a lawyer from bringing or defending a proceeding, or asserting or controverting an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous; RPC 3.3, prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal and from offering evidence that the lawyer knows to be false; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Kathleen A.

1538.html,20931,James Conlin,,Disbarment,11/17/2010,,"James J. Conlin (WSBA No. 20931, admitted 1991), of Tacoma, was disbarred, effective November 17, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline is based on conduct involving conversion of funds, the commission of crimes, misrepresentation, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and violations of the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct.In 2008, Mr. Conlin acted as the escrow agent in the sale of a business. On October 1, 2008, after the closing took place, Mr. Conlin received a check for $52,370 from the buyer, which he deposited into his trust account. From those funds, Mr. Conlin was obligated to make various disbursements in accordance with the escrow instructions and the closing statements he prepared. Mr. Conlin failed to pay off the amount owing on a line of credit of approximately $13,870 secured by a lien against the businessâ€™s property (bank lien). Between October 2008 and March 2009, Mr. Conlin appropriated those funds to his own use. In late October 2008, when the seller asked for an explanation of why he had not paid off the bank lien, Mr. Conlin told him that the funds had been misdirected due to a miscommunication. Mr. Conlin subsequently made payments on the bank lien, but never completely paid off the outstanding balance. The sellerâ€™s agent filed a grievance against Mr. Conlin for not having paid the bank lien. Mr. Conlin submitted a one-page response in which he stated that he had â€œinadvertently misdirectedâ€ the money that was to have been used to pay the debt. The response was false and misleading. In May 2009, disciplinary counsel served Mr. Conlin with a subpoena commanding him to testify and produce documents related to the business transaction. The deposition was continued twice at Mr. Conlinâ€™s request. At his deposition, Mr. Conlin testified under oath that he had not produced any of the requested documents because his bank statements had been mistakenly mailed by the bank to an â€œimproper address.â€ He also testified that in early October 2008 he had made a wire transfer of slightly less than $14,000 from his IOLTA account by which he intended to pay off the bank lien. He testified that the funds were mistakenly transferred to the account of one â€œJason Martinezâ€ instead of to the bank which held the lien. Mr. Conlin testified that â€œMartinezâ€ sent him a check for $13,000 in November or December 2008, which he deposited in his trust account, and that â€œMartinezâ€ stopped payment on the check before it could clear. Mr. Conlin testified that â€œMartinezâ€ then disappeared. Mr. Conlinâ€™s testimony was false and misleading. After his deposition, Mr. Conlin sent disciplinary counsel a one-page document entitled â€œTransactions Reportâ€ that purported to show that a payment was made from Mr. Conlinâ€™s trust account on October 3, 2008, to pay off the lien and, in later entries, that a bad check was deposited and then returned for insufficient funds. The â€œTransaction Reportâ€ was false. Mr. Conlin also sent disciplinary counsel a fax in which he stated that he or his bank would produce other documents described in the subpoena, but failed to do so. Mr. Conlin failed to respond to a subsequent request for information.Mr. Conlinâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.15A(b), prohibiting a lawyer from using, converting, borrowing, or pledging client or third-person property for the lawyerâ€™s own use; RPC 1.15A(f), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client or third person the property which the client or third person is entitled to receive; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, theft, false swearing, and perjury) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Scott G.

1539.html,29559,Christopher Bartow,,Suspension,12/9/2010,,"Christopher P. Bartow (WSBA No. 29559, admitted 1999), of Ellensburg, was suspended for one year, effective December 9, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court. This discipline was based on conduct involving lack of respect for rights of third persons and violations of the attorney oath.Matter No. 1: In January 2008, Mr. Bartow represented a client in a marriage dissolution action. During the proceeding, the court appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) to perform a parenting plan evaluation. The GAL completed her report, recommending that the opposing party retain primary custody of the children. Mr. Bartow filed a lengthy written critique of the GAL's evaluation, in which he used inflammatory language and made degrading and offensive comments regarding the GAL personally. While Mr. Bartow's filing of a written response to the GAL report was proper pursuant to RCW 26.12.175(1)(c), which permits parties to file written responses to any report filed by a court-appointed GAL, and some of the response served a legitimate purpose, much of the content was inflammatory, degrading, and inappropriate, and served no purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden the GAL or the court.Mr. Bartow also obtained information from the GAL's personal dissolution file and provided that information to the Association. This information came from a file that was under seal. Although Mr. Bartow may have been unaware that this private information was under seal, it served no purpose other than to embarrass or burden the GAL.Matter No. 2: On August 7, 2008, Mr. Bartow was representing a client in a voluntary settlement conference in a paternity action. The settlement conference was held in Judge A's courtroom. Prior to the conference, a domestic violence order had been issued restricting Mr. Bartow's client from having contact with the opposing party. Judge A began the conference by focusing on the domestic violence issue. Mr. Bartow wanted to focus on the custody and visitation schedule instead. Mr. Bartow interrupted Judge A on more than one occasion and told her he had had mediation training and that she was not conducting the conference properly. His comments towards Judge A were berating and insulting, and his manner, tone, and demeanor towards Judge A were overly loud, challenging of the judge's authority, and disrespectful. After several interruptions, speaking in an inappropriately loud and agitated manner and tone, Mr. Bartow disrupted and unilaterally terminated the conference. As he left, Judge A advised Mr. Bartow that he would be no longer permitted in her courtroom.Mr. Bartow's conduct violated RPC 4.4(a), which prohibits a lawyer, in representing a client, from using means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person, or using methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of such a person; and RPC 8.4(k), prohibiting a lawyer from violating his or her oath as an attorney (here, by violating APR 5(e)).Erica W.

The discipline is based upon his failure to diligently represent a client, practicing law while his license was suspended, and failure to cooperate with a Bar Association investigation.Mr. Bopp represented a client in the Superior Court appeal of a small claims judgment. Mr. Bopp knew that statutes and court rules required his client to have the opposing party served with the Notice of Appeal, case schedule and other pleadings. Although Mr. Bopp told his client he would serve these documents, he did not. The court continued the hearing, specifically indicating in the order that the opposing party had not been served. Mr. Bopp again failed to serve the opposing party. The court granted Mr. Boppâ€™s motion for an Order of Default, Dismissal and Order to Disburse Funds.After learning of the appeal and order, the opposing party obtained an order reinstating the original judgment and assessing $1,250 in terms against Mr. Boppâ€™s client for failure to serve the Notice of Appeal. Mr. Bopp did not attend this hearing, notify his clients of the hearing date, or send his clients copies of the pleadings or the courtâ€™s order. Mr. Bopp did not respond to the Bar Associationâ€™s requests for information in this case. Mr. Boppâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to exercise reasonable diligence in representing a client; RPC 3.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from knowingly disobeying an obligation under the rules of the tribunal; and RLD 2.8(b), requiring lawyers to cooperate with Bar Association investigations.In October 1996, the Supreme Court suspended Mr. Boppâ€™s license for failure to comply with the Continuing Legal Education requirements. In May 1998, Mr. Bopp continued to advertise his legal practice in several phone directories. Mr. Boppâ€™s staff answered his phone ""law offices"" and were unaware of his suspension. The staff stated that Mr. Bopp continued to work on real estate transactions during his suspension. Mr. Bopp failed to respond to the Bar Associationâ€™s requests for response and deposition subpoena on this issue.

1541.html,15020,Gary Randall,,Suspension,12/27/2010,,"Gary Evan Randall (WSBA No. 15020, admitted 1985), of Woodinville, was suspended for six (6) months, effective December 27, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline resulted from conduct involving failure to act with reasonable diligence, failure to communicate, violations of duties, practicing law while suspended, and non-cooperation with disciplinary counsel during an investigation.Matter #1: In August 2006, Client A hired Mr. Randall to bring contempt proceedings against her ex-husband for failure to pay her share of the equity from the sale of their marital residence as set forth in their dissolution decree. Client A expressed to Mr. Randall her concern that her ex-husband would sell assets or otherwise spend the money that was owed to her. Client A paid Mr. Randall $200 for an initial meeting and a retainer of $1,000. Over the next month, Mr. Randall failed to return any of Client Aâ€™s calls or meet with her. In October 2006, Mr. Randall sent Client A another bill, some incomplete draft form pleadings, and a draft letter to obtain a copy of Client Aâ€™s divorce decree. Mr. Randall never filed any of the pleadings, never mailed the letter, and subsequently failed to return Client Aâ€™s numerous phone calls to him. Client A terminated his services. Mr. Randall subsequently refunded to Client A the $1,000 retainer, but did not return to her the $200 for the initial meeting. In February 2007, Client A hired a different lawyer, who obtained a judgment against her ex-husband for approximately $55,000 but was unable to collect on the judgment because by that time her ex-husband had sold his business and declared bankruptcy.Matter #2: Mr. Randall represented Client B in a boundary dispute, which settled in February 2007. As part of the settlement, the opposing party agreed to pay Mr. Randallâ€™s clients $16,900, plant screening plants along the boundary line, and grant an easement necessary for the maintenance of Client B's septic system. Opposing counsel timely sent Mr. Randall a check for $16,900, a notice of settlement, and a proposed draft easement for Client B to review. Client B and Mr. Randall had concerns about certain of the terms of the proposed easement, including whether the incomplete acknowledgement of the opposing partyâ€™s signatures made the easement invalid. In March 2007, Mr. Randall spoke once with Client B about the proposed easement, but did not communicate with her thereafter or communicate any suggested revisions to opposing counsel. On March 28, opposing counsel sent to Mr. Randall a signed stipulation for dismissal that had to be filed before April 9, 2007, and a signed original easement for him to record. Mr. Randall never filed the stipulation for dismissal. On June 18, 2007, the clerk gave notice that the court would dismiss the case for want of prosecution. For over a year thereafter, Client B called Mr. Randall numerous times asking him to contact opposing counsel about the changes they wanted to the easement and wanting him to finalize the easement. Client B also sought Mr. Randall's assistance in getting the opposing party, who had put their property up for sale, to plant the screening trees per the settlement agreement. Mr. Randall took no further action regarding the easement and did not respond to Client B's efforts to contact him. Client B paid Mr. Randall $7,690 in fees in connection with the boundary line dispute. Client B, acting pro se, was unable to resolve the legal issues with the neighbors.Non-cooperation and Unauthorized Practice of Law: In September 2008, Client B filed a grievance against Mr. Randall. Mr. Randall did not respond to the grievance or to subsequent requests from Disciplinary Counsel to submit a response. Mr. Randall did not appear for a deposition or provide a client file after being served twice by Disciplinary Counsel with subpoenas duces tecum. Mr. Randall states that he did not open the envelopes containing the requests or the subpoenas duces tecum. On January 22, 2009, the Supreme Court entered an order suspending Mr. Randall from the practice of law pending his cooperation with Disciplinary Counsel's investigation. Mr. Randall eventually responded to Client B's grievance and provided Disciplinary Counsel with his file. He was reinstated to active practice on March 6, 2009.On January 21, 2009, Mr. Randall filed a notice of appearance on behalf of a defendant in a Superior Court matter. As set forth above, Mr. Randall was suspended by order of the Washington Supreme Court on January 22, 2009. The Court sent Mr. Randall a copy of its order informing him of his suspension. Mr. Randall states that he did not open the envelope. On January 23, 2009, disciplinary counsel sent Mr. Randall a certified letter regarding his duties on suspension, including notice that he was prohibited from practicing law. Mr. Randall received that letter, but states that he did not open the envelope. During his suspension, Mr. Randall filed an answer to the complaint in the Superior Court matter, negotiated a resolution of the case, and signed and presented the court a stipulation for dismissal. Mr. Randall did not inform his client, the court or opposing counsel that his license to practice law in Washington was suspended.Mr. Randallâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to promptly inform the client of any decision of circumstance with respect to which the client's informed consent is required, reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the client's objectives are to be accomplished, keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.16(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation will result in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; RPC 5.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction; RPC 5.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Special Disciplinary Counsel Scott A.W.

1543.html,29978,Noel Lerner,,Disbarment,12/27/2010,,"Noel Lerner (WSBA No. 29978, admitted 2000), of Buckley, was disbarred, effective December 27, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on conduct in 11 separate matters involving lack of diligence, failure to communicate, charging unreasonable fees, trust account irregularities, failure to protect clientsâ€™ interests, failure to expedite litigation, making false statements, failure to disclose factual misstatements on documents submitted to the court, failure to supervise subordinates, direct solicitation of a client, dishonest conduct, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and failure to cooperate in disciplinary investigations.Dissolution matters : In late 2003 and 2004, five clients hired Ms. Lerner to represent them in their individual dissolutions. In one of the dissolutions, Ms. Lerner engaged in a pattern of intransigence during the proceedings sufficient enough to warrant monetary sanctions that her client ultimately had to pay. This included repeatedly failing to show up or showing up late for scheduled hearings and refusing to engage in meaningful settlement negotiations. Ms. Lerner moved for reconsideration of the sanctions after the deadline for doing so had elapsed and failed to note the motion for hearing. As a result, the judge never saw the motion nor ruled upon it.In another dissolution matter, Ms. Lerner failed to attend a scheduled status conference or comply with court rules which required her to serve notice on opposing counsel regarding the date for a motion hearing. In four dissolution matters, Ms. Lerner failed to communicate with her clients, including failing to return clientsâ€™ phone calls, failing to keep clients fully apprised of their matters or to provide them with copies of papers filed on their behalf, and failing to inform a client of why the court imposed sanctions on him. In two dissolution matters, Ms. Lerner failed to timely file documents, which included a notice of appearance, a notice of withdrawal, an answer to a dissolution petition, and final dissolution papers. In two dissolution matters, Ms. Lerner allowed employees who worked under her to submit documents to the court containing factual misstatements. Ms. Lerner failed to review these documents or to correct them after learning of their inaccuracies. Two dissolution clients paid Ms. Lerner to represent them, but never received an accounting of the time spent on their cases, information about the rate at which they would be billed, or a refund of unearned fees. In one dissolution matter, Ms. Lerner withdrew from the case, but was unable to find or provide the client with all of the original documents he had given her.In 2007, while Ms. Lerner was awaiting final action on a hearing officerâ€™s unchallenged recommendation that she be suspended, a client hired her to represent him in his dissolution. Ms. Lerner did not inform the client of the likelihood of her impending discipline. She told him her office was in disarray due to remodeling. The client paid Ms. Lerner $3,500 to represent him through the pre-trial stage of the dissolution proceedings and requested that Ms. Lerner obtain a restraining order against his spouse. Ms. Lerner filed the petition for dissolution, but failed to timely seek a restraining order, return the clientâ€™s calls inquiring about his case, or prepare for her only court appearance made on his behalf. In April 2008, after the Disciplinary Board approved the suspension recommendation, Ms. Lerner told her client that she must withdraw from his case because of a conflict of interest. Without obtaining the clientâ€™s consent, Ms. Lerner transmitted his file, including confidential financial documents, to another lawyer. She did not return the clientâ€™s documents, refund any unearned portion of his fee or provide him with an accounting, and failed to sign or file a Notice of Withdrawal and Substitution or respond to communications from successor counsel. The client filed a grievance with the Bar Association against Ms. Lerner, to which Ms. Lerner failed to respond.Non-cooperation : In October 2007, the Bar Association received a grievance against Ms. Lerner alleging that she acted incompetently in her representation of a client and tried to convince the client, who was the defendant in a criminal matter, to accept a plea agreement against his wishes. Disciplinary counsel sent Ms. Lerner a copy of the grievance and two letters requesting that she respond. She did not respond. Ms. Lerner agreed to a deposition after disciplinary counsel issued a subpoena duces tecum. She appeared for the deposition, but never addressed the grievance.In December 2007, the Bar Association received a notice that Ms. Lernerâ€™s trust account was overdrawn. The Associationâ€™s audit manager and disciplinary counsel both sent requests that Ms. Lerner provide an explanation of the overdraft with supporting documentation. Ms. Lerner did not respond. After disciplinary counsel issued a subpoena duces tecum for Ms. Lerner to appear for deposition in February 2008, she requested a postponement of the deposition. Disciplinary counsel postponed the deposition to March 2008; however, Ms. Lerner never provided an explanation of the overdraft or produced the requested documents. Disciplinary counsel obtained information directly from the bank, which showed that Ms. Lerner had made $800 worth of cash withdrawals from her trust account.Criminal matters : In 2007, a client hired Ms. Lerner to defend him against charges of attempted murder. Ms. Lerner failed to complete discovery or comply with the omnibus order filed by the judge. The day of the trial, Ms. Lerner appeared at the trial unprepared to go forward. Ms. Lerner did not appear at the sentencing hearing, instead sending another attorney who was unfamiliar with the case. The court sentenced the client to 18 monthsâ€™ incarceration.In 2007, while Ms. Lerner was awaiting final action on a hearing officerâ€™s unchallenged recommendation that she be suspended, she directly solicited employment from a potential client who was in jail on a charge of vehicular homicide. The clientâ€™s aunt paid Ms. Lerner $5,000 as a down payment for her legal fee. There was no written fee agreement and Ms. Lerner did not inform the client of her imminent suspension. During the five weeks she represented the client, Ms. Lerner gave her client discovery documents without obtaining the prosecutorâ€™s approval or redacting the documents as required by court rule. Although Ms. Lerner assured her client that she was preparing for trial and would hire experts in her defense, she informed the prosecutor that the case would end in a plea. Ms. Lerner misinformed her client of the sentencing range that applied to the charges against her, significantly overstating the maximum sentence. When the client became dissatisfied at Ms. Lernerâ€™s apparent failure to investigate or take any action in her case, she hired another lawyer to represent her on the charges. Ms. Lerner failed to acknowledge the substitution of counsel or forward to the successor counsel any files or documentation of work she had performed on the case. Ms. Lerner failed to refund any portion of the $5,000 fee or provide the client documentation to substantiate that sheâ€™d earned any portion of the fee.In 2008, while awaiting final action on a hearing officerâ€™s unchallenged recommendation that she be suspended, a client hired Ms. Lerner to represent him on a DUI charge. Members of the clientâ€™s family paid Ms. Lerner $5,400. There was no written fee agreement, and Ms. Lerner did not communicate with the family members or her client that she would be unable to carry out the representation because of her likely suspension until after they had fully paid her fee. Ms. Lerner failed to file any pretrial motions, conducted little or no investigation of her clientâ€™s case, and failed to appear for hearings, instead requesting continuances. On the day of the trial, Ms. Lerner appeared only to request another continuance and to state that she would not be going forward because she was â€œdisqualified.â€ This was misleading. In fact, she had been informed that her disciplinary suspension would begin the next day.The clients or members of the clientsâ€™ families in the four criminal cases filed grievances against Ms. Lerner with the Bar Association. Ms. Lerner failed to respond to any of the grievances.Ms. Lernerâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses; RPC 1.5(b), requiring that the scope of the representation and the basis or rate of the fee and expenses for which the client will be responsible be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation; RPC 1.15A(h)(5), requiring that all withdrawals from a trust account be made only to a named payee and not to cash; RPC 1.16(d), requiring that, upon termination of representation, a lawyer take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; former RPC 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; former RPC 3.3(c), requiring a lawyer who has offered material evidence and comes to know of its falsity to promptly disclose this fact to the tribunal; RPC 3.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly disobeying an obligation under the rules of a tribunal; RPC 5.1(a), requiring a partner in a law firm to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that all lawyers in the firm conform to the Rules of Professional Conduct; RPC 5.1(b), requiring a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over another lawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the other lawyer conforms to the Rules of Professional Conduct; former RPC 5.3(a), requiring a partner in a law firm to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that the conduct of a non-lawyer employee is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; RPC 5.3(b), requiring a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over a non-lawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the non-lawyerâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; RPC 5.3(c), requiring a lawyer to be responsible for conduct of a non-lawyer that would be a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if engaged in by a lawyer if the lawyer orders or, with the knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved, or has direct supervisory authority over the person and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable remedial action; RPC 7.3(a), prohibiting a lawyer from directly soliciting professional employment from a prospective client when a significant motive for the lawyerâ€™s doing so is the lawyerâ€™s pecuniary gain; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Natalea Skvir represented the Bar Association.

1545.html,25096,Christina Denison,,Disbarment,12/27/2010,,"Christina S. Denison (WSBA No. 25096, admitted 1995), of Bellevue, was disbarred, effective December 27, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to provide diligent representation, abandonment of practice, failure to communicate, and failure to comply with duties imposed by the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct.In March 2006, a client hired Ms. Denison to represent her in removal proceedings in an immigration matter after the clientâ€™s Application for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was denied. The client paid Ms. Denison a $3,000 non-refundable flat fee. On July 31, 2006, Ms. Denison appeared on the client's behalf at the hearing in the removal proceedings, but had not yet submitted a FOIA request. At that hearing, Ms. Denison requested the immigration court to perform a de novo review of the TPS denial and informed the court that she would file the FOIA request for the TPS file. The Court set the next hearing for January 8, 2007, giving Ms. Denison five months to obtain the documents in her FOIA request. In August 2006, Ms. Denison moved her office. She informed her client of the new address. However, around this time period, the client began having difficulty reaching her. The client, and others on her behalf, made multiple unsuccessful attempts to contact Ms. Denison in order to obtain information about the case. The clientâ€™s employer sent the client a letter requesting information about her immigration status, which the client copied and mailed to Ms. Denison. The client never received a response. Sometime after July 2006, Ms. Denison submitted the FOIA request. Ms. Denison had not yet received the requested documents by the time of the January 8, 2007 hearing. She asked the court for a continuance, which the court denied because Ms. Denison had not tried to expedite or compel the Government to honor the FOIA request. The court further found it did not have jurisdiction to hear the client's TPS request de novo and that nothing in the FOIA request would provide the court with jurisdiction. The court found the client ineligible for any other form of relief, granted voluntary departure in lieu of removal, and ordered the client to pay a voluntary departure bond. In February 2007, Ms. Denison appealed the client's case to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). Ms. Denison did not inform the client that she filed an appeal on her behalf. In March 2007, Ms. Denison moved her office. Again, she communicated her address change to the client, who met once with her at her officeâ€™s new location. The client attempted to meet with Ms. Denison a second time, but Ms. Denison refused to meet with her. Thereafter, communication with Ms. Denison became increasingly difficult for the client. Ms. Denison did not respond to the clientâ€™s numerous telephone messages.In late 2007, while the appeal was pending, a favorable decision in another immigration case gave the Immigration Court judges authority to issue decisions on TPS applications, and the Government filed a motion to remand the client's case to the immigration court. The BIA remanded the client's case and the immigration court sent Ms. Denison a notice of hearing in the client's removal proceedings, scheduled for February 3, 2010. Ms. Denison did not inform her client of this hearing and continued to ignore requests for information. In August 2009, Ms. Denison moved from her office without leaving any notes, contact information, or a forwarding address. At some point, Ms. Denison disconnected her office telephone. By November 2009, the client hired a new lawyer to handle her immigration matter. The new lawyer did not know the status of the case, was not aware of the February hearing, and was unable to send Ms. Denison a copy of his motion to substitute counsel. Ms. Denison provided the client with her client file and a transmittal letter indicating that she could no longer represent her.  However, the file was not complete and did not clearly indicate whether the Government ever complied with the FOIA request. On February 3, 2010, the client and her new lawyer appeared at the master calendar hearing. Despite the fact that she was still counsel of record, Ms. Denison did not appear at the hearing.The client subsequently filed a grievance against Ms. Denison. Ms. Denisonâ€™s failure to update the Bar Association with her address or other contact information resulted in her failing to respond to the Bar Associationâ€™s request for a written response to the clientâ€™s grievance.Ms. Denisonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to promptly inform the client of any decision of circumstance with respect to which the client's informed consent is required, reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the client's objectives are to be accomplished, keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

Mahr (WSBA No. 19555, admitted 1990), of Moses Lake, was disbarred, effective December 27, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to act with reasonable diligence, failure to communicate, charging unreasonable fees, failure to protect clientsâ€™ interests, false statements to a tribunal, conversion of clientsâ€™ funds, dishonesty, and noncooperation during the investigation of a disciplinary matter.Between May 2006 and January 2010, Mr. Mahr was hired by clients to represent them in fourteen different immigration matters. Mr. Mahr charged these clients flat fees and, in many of the matters, either did not diligently pursue the work required or did not complete or even start the outlined legal work. Mr. Mahrâ€™s lack of diligence often resulted in delays in the clientsâ€™ cases. Mr. Mahrâ€™s conduct in these matters included:â€¢ Failing to appear at scheduled hearings, file applications and, in one matter, file an appeal;â€¢ Failing to adequately communicate with clients about their cases or the basis for the fee he was charging them and, in some cases, making misrepresentations to clients in order to receive additional funds;â€¢ Making misrepresentations about his fee to a small claims court after being sued by clients;â€¢ Forging a clientâ€™s signature on a petition;â€¢ Withdrawing from representation of clients without explanation and then failing to return clientsâ€™ repeated phone calls or refund their unearned fees; â€¢ Failing to inform clients, opposing counsel, or the court about his three-year suspension, effective November 10, 2009, and continuing to accept fees from clients following the effective date of the suspension;The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) sent certified letters regarding each grievance to Mr. Mahr, seeking his response and requesting clientsâ€™ files and other information. Mr. Mahr did not claim the letters and never responded to the requests.Mr. Mahrâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to promptly inform the client of any decision of circumstance with respect to which the client's informed consent is required, reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the client's objectives are to be accomplished, keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses; RPC 1.5(b), requiring the lawyer to communicate to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation the scope of the representation and the basis or rate of the fee and expenses for which the client will be responsible; RPC 1.16(d), requiring the lawyer, upon termination of representation, to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred; RPC 3.3(a), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or failing to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Linda B.

1550.html,12533,William Dippolito,,Resignation in Lieu of Disbarment,12/30/2010,,"William F. Dippolito (WSBA No. 12533, admitted 1956), of Tacoma, resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective December 30, 2010. While not admitting the misconduct alleged, Mr. Dippolito affirmatively admitted that the WSBA could prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence the alleged violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, and that proof of such violations would suffice to result in disbarment. This resignation is based on conduct involving theft of investors' funds. According to the Statement of Misconduct: Mr. Dippolito acted as attorney for individuals and corporations engaging in schemes promoting high yield investment programs designed to defraud investors. Mr. Dippolito acted as the escrow agent for the receipt of investor funds. He used the title ""paymaster"" and assured investors that he would hold, in trust, investment funds wired to his paymaster account and that he would safeguard their funds until a banking instrument was delivered to him permitting their release. The principals of Corporation A, for which Mr. Dippolito acted as attorney and ""paymaster"" in July 2008, falsely alleged to investors that their funds would be used to purchase United States Treasury notes as collateral for a transaction with another corporation. In fact, the principals intended to abscond with investor funds. On July 16, 2008, Mr. Dippolito wrote and signed a trust agreement with Investor A stating that Investor A would deposit $141,000 via wire transfer into Mr. Dippolito's trust account to enable Corporation A to purchase the notes. The agreement conditioned that Mr. Dippolito would not release Investor A's money until the receipt and authentication by Mr. Dippolito of a bank guarantee instrument known as an MT760. On July 17, 2008, Investor A wired $141,000 to Mr. Dippolito's paymaster trust account. The same day, Mr. Dippolito released investor A's money to Corporation A's principals without the issuance or authentication of an MT760 form. Before releasing the money, Mr. Dippolito removed $1,500 from the $141,000 as his payment. Investor A demanded that Mr. Dippolito return the funds. Mr. Dippolito assured investor A that his funds would be returned, but failed to do so. Following a November 2008 civil suit filed by Investor A, Mr. Dippolito stipulated to an entry of judgment against him for damages in the amount of $160,000, but subsequently failed to pay the judgment.The principals of Corporation B, for which Mr. Dippolito acted as attorney and ""paymaster"" in June and July 2008, falsely alleged to investors that their funds would be used to purchase a 500 million euro high-yield medium-term note to support a non-existent trading program. In fact, the principals intended to abscond with investor funds. In late June or early July 2008, Mr. Dippolito wrote and signed a trust agreement with Investor B stating that Investor B would deposit $2,500,000 via wire transfer into Mr. Dippolito's trust account to enable Corporation B to purchase the note. The agreement conditioned that Mr. Dippolito would not release the money until the receipt and authentication by Mr. Dippolito of an MT760. In June or July 2008, Investor B wired $2,500,000 to Mr. Dippolito's trust account. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Dippolito released the money to Corporation B's principals without the issuance or authentication of an MT760 form. Before releasing the money, Mr. Dippolito removed approximately $17,000 from the $2,500,000 as his payment. Investor B demanded that Mr. Dippolito return the money. Although Mr. Dippolito assured Investor B that his money would be returned, he failed to do so. On April 22, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a civil fraud action in Los Angeles, California against Mr. Dippolito, charging him with aiding and abetting Corporation B and its principals in perpetrating fraud against investors in violation of the Securities Exchange Act.Previously, in July 2007, the SEC charged Mr. Dippolito with engaging in fraudulent conduct in a scheme similar to those perpetrated against Investors A and B. As a result, to resolve the suit, Mr. Dippolito consented to being permanently enjoined by the SEC from aiding and abetting violations of the Exchange Act, and to disgorging that portion of investor money he retained as his share of the fraudulent scheme.Mr. Dippolito's conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, first-degree theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Kathleen A.T.

1552.html,19804,Komron Allahyari,,Resignation in Lieu of Disbarment,1/10/2011,,"Komron Michael Allahyari (WSBA No. 19804, admitted 1990), of Seattle, resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective January 10, 2011. Mr. Allahyari affirmatively admitted that the WSBA could prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence the alleged violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, and that proof of such violations would suffice to result in disbarment, but did not affirmatively admit the facts and misconduct herein. This resignation is based on conduct involving dishonesty, and failure to maintain trust account records and individual client ledgers. The Statement of Misconduct reads as follows:In December 1997, Mr. Allahyari entered into a written agreement to represent Clients in a personal injury action on a contingent fee basis. Since Clients had been injured during the commission of a crime, their substantial medical costs were paid by the Washington State Crime Victims Compensation Program (CVCP). The CVCP timely and periodically sent to Mr. Allahyari notices of its increasing lien for the Clientsâ€™ medical expenses.In February 2003, the Clients agreed to settle their claims in return for $125,000 from the defendantsâ€™ commercial general liability insurer and assignment of the defendantsâ€™ claims against a liability insurer and against Lawyer B. On February 5, 2003, pursuant to the terms of the settlement, the liability insurer wired $125,000 into Mr. Allahyariâ€™s trust account. Pending resolution of the CVCP lien, Mr. Allahyari withheld $26,000 from the settlement. To pay the substantial costs of their case, the Clients had borrowed $80,000 from a relative in return for a promissory note at 12% interest to repay the loan out of the proceeds of their claims. On February 18, 2004, the Clients settled the assigned claims against the liquor liability insurer for $672,500. Mr. Allahyari deposited the $672,500 settlement check into his trust account. In February 2004, the CVCP had liens of at least $100,406.64 on the Clientsâ€™ settlement. On February 24, 2004, Clients agreed to pay their relative $125,000 in full satisfaction of the promissory note and accrued interest. On March 4, 2004, Mr. Allahyari met with Clients to go over the Settlement Statement, and then commenced disbursement of the settlement. According to the Settlement Statement, Mr. Allahyari should have withheld $100,406.04 from the disbursements for use in resolving the CVCP lien. Mr. Allahyari disbursed $80,000 in repayment of the loan from the relative, $187,899.52 to Clients, $9,191.30 to his firm for reimbursement of costs, an additional $15,000 to one of the Clients, and $2,115 to another individual. Mr. Allahyari subsequently made withdrawals of the remaining funds from the trust account for his personal and business use, reducing the balance to zero by May 31, 2005. On July 26, 2004, the CVCP had issued Distribution Orders reducing its lien to $50,242.52. To settle this lien, Mr. Allahyari negotiated a compromise whereby the CVCP accepted $35,088.83 in full payment of its lien, which recognized an additional claim by Mr. Allahyari of $3,011.41 in costs. Because Mr. Allahyari had already removed all of the Clientsâ€™ funds from his trust account, he funded the $35,088.33 payment from his own funds. Mr. Allahyari did not maintain an individual Client ledger for the funds he received in trust for his Clients. He removed funds he should have withheld from disbursement to pay the CVCP lien, and used the funds for his personal use. Mr. Allahyari failed to maintain other clientsâ€™ trust funds in trust, using them for his personal use before distributing them to the appropriate parties.Mr. Allahyariâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and that no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein; current RPC 1.15A(b), prohibiting a lawyer from using, converting, borrowing, or pledging client or third-person property for the lawyerâ€™s own use; and RPC 1.15B(a), requiring a lawyer to maintain current trust account records and listing the minimum requirements of what the records must include.Leslie C.

1553.html,7370,Paul King,,Disbarment,1/13/2011,,"Paul H. King (WSBA No. 7370, admitted 1977), formerly of Seattle, was disbarred, effective January 13, 2011, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. This discipline is based on conduct involving the commission of a crime. For more information, see In re King, __Wn.2d__, __P.3d__ (2011). Note: While this matter was on appeal, the Supreme Court ordered Mr. King's disbarment in an unrelated case decided in June 2010 (In re King, 168 Wn.2d 888, 232 P.3d 1095 (2010)). Disbarment was imposed for, among other things, practicing law while suspended. This subsequent, second disbarment does not affect that previous order.In July 2008, Mr. King was charged in United States District Court with five counts of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§1341, based on allegations that he helped an individual fraudulently obtain benefits from the Washington State Employment Security Department. On November 24, 2008, Mr. King signed a plea agreement, admitting he was guilty of the charged offense and admitting to the facts necessary to establish the elements of mail fraud. Before entering the guilty plea, Mr. King testified under oath that his plea was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. Mr. King was convicted of mail fraud and sentenced to 10 months of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $44,858 in restitution to the Washington State Employment Security Department. Mr. King previously had been suspended three times from the practice of law for conduct involving dishonesty. Mr. King did not dispute the hearing officer's finding of fact, the presumptive sanction, or the sanction analysis, but rather questioned the fairness of the disciplinary proceedings. The Court found his arguments to be unsubstantiated and that Mr. King's guilty plea was properly given preclusive effect under ELC 10.4(c).Mr. King's conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law.Scott G.

1556.html,27472,Sandra Ferguson,,Suspension,2/3/2011,,"Sandra L. Ferguson (WSBA No. 27472, admitted 1997), of Seattle, was suspended for 90 days, effective February 3, 2011, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. For more information, see In re Ferguson, 170 Wn.2d 916, 246 P.3d 1236 (2011). This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to disclose relevant facts to the court, appearing ex parte without notice to the opposing party, and obtaining an ex parte order and other relief through deception and misrepresentation. In spring 2005, Ms. Fergusonâ€™s brother and sister-in-law (Clients) were involved in litigation. Prior to Ms. Ferguson representing them, Clients had given the opposing party equity in a rental house as the down payment toward the purchase of a restaurant. The opposing party took possession of the house and agreed to make the mortgage payments on the house. By 2004, Clients claimed the opposing party was in default on the mortgage payments and, in February 2005, Clients filed a complaint seeking a writ of restitution to regain possession of the house from the opposing party. On March 18, 2005, the superior court ordered that an additional hearing be scheduled to sort out the partiesâ€™ rights, but in the interim the opposing party would need to bring the mortgage payments current by March 28. During the second hearing, on March 30, 2005, both sides argued over whether the mortgage payments had been made. The opposing side explained to the court that if Ms. Fergusonâ€™s clients were given temporary possession of the house, they would â€œfile bankruptcy, immediately claim that they [had] equity in the houseâ€¦,â€ and then the bankruptcy court would deprive the superior court of jurisdiction and Ms. Fergusonâ€™s clients would be able to retain possession of the house permanently. Around the time of these hearings, Clients were exploring the option of bankruptcy. They had been told by a bankruptcy attorney that gaining possession of the house prior to bankruptcy would enhance their financial and legal position significantly. The court consolidated the two matters, denied the writ of restitution, and ordered the case set for trial on the merits as soon as possible, deciding â€œmore testimony and comments and study on itâ€ was necessary to determine the rights of each party. The court found the opposing party was entitled to maintain possession of the house to preserve the status quo.Ms. Ferguson stepped in as counsel for Clients after the March 30, 2005, hearing. On April 11, 2005, without notice to the opposing party, Ms. Ferguson appeared ex parte before the judge who ruled in the two earlier hearings. During these proceedings, Ms. Ferguson presented her pleadings and argued that the opposing party had violated the courtâ€™s March 18 order and lied to the court at the March 30 hearing by failing to make the required mortgage payments, yet stating they had done so. Ms. Ferguson did not inform the court of her clientsâ€™ intention to file for bankruptcy or that the mortgage company had recently required all mortgage payments to be made with certified funds, which might account for the delay in the mortgage companyâ€™s processing of checks. The judge signed Ms. Fergusonâ€™s proposed order holding the opposing party in contempt and granting a writ of restitution for the possession of the house to Ms. Fergusonâ€™s clients as a remedy for the opposing partyâ€™s contempt.When counsel for the opposing party received notice of the ex parte hearing and order approximately two days after the hearing, he called the judge and scheduled a hearing for his motion to vacate the order. The afternoon before the hearing, Ms. Fergusonâ€™s clients filed for bankruptcy using funds provided by Ms. Ferguson. Ms. Ferguson appeared at the hearing on the motion to vacate with notice of the bankruptcy filing that deprived the superior court of jurisdiction. Ultimately, the opposing partyâ€™s claim for the house was never heard. When the opposing party received an offer of purchase for the restaurant, the parties settled all claims with respect to both properties.Ms. Fergusonâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 3.3(f), requiring a lawyer, in an ex parte proceeding, to inform the tribunal of all relevant facts known to the lawyer that should be disclosed to permit the tribunal to make an informed decision; former RPC 3.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly disobeying an obligation under the rules of a tribunal except for an open refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists; former RPC 3.5(b), prohibiting a lawyer from communicating ex parte with a judge except as permitted by law; former RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and former RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Jonathan H.

1561.html,17943,Stanley Tate,,Disbarment,3/10/2011,,"Stanley D. Tate (WSBA No. 17943, admitted 1988), of Seattle, was disbarred, effective March 10, 2011, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to provide competent representation, charging unreasonable fees, incorrectly charging contingent fees, trust account irregularities, failure to maintain records of clientsâ€™ funds, failure to safeguard clientsâ€™ property or provide a written accounting upon distribution of property, offering false evidence, making false statements to the tribunal, the commission of crimes, and engaging in dishonest conduct that reflects disregard for the rule of the law and demonstrates unfitness to practice law.Trust Account Irregularities: Mr. Tate was a solo practitioner whose practice, since 1997, consisted largely of personal injury cases. In the 1990s, Mr. Tate opened an IOLTA trust account, which he also used as a general business and personal account. Mr. Tate misappropriated client funds from his trust account on 15 separate occasions between August 2002 and September 2005. The total amount of misappropriated funds was $62,201.40. These funds were clientsâ€™ settlement proceeds earmarked to reimburse Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and medical costs. During this time period, Mr. Tate informed clients that all funds earmarked to pay PIP and other costs would be used only for those purposes. To conceal his misappropriation of client funds, Mr. Tate issued checks reflecting that he was paying â€œcostsâ€ or â€œfeesâ€ when he was actually using the funds for personal purposes. Mr. Tate also concealed the misappropriation of client funds through a series of transfers where he had certified checks issued to insurers with PIP subrogation claims, but ultimately cashed the check himself and used the funds for personal purposes. During the Bar Association investigation, Mr. Tate intentionally concealed the disbursement of funds by writing the word â€œvoidâ€ on the front of certified checks, even though the checks had been cashed by him. On five occasions between January 14, 2004, and February 21, 2007, Mr. Tate submitted trust account declarations to the Bar Association, under penalty of perjury, stating that all trust accounts, client funds, and records were being maintained in compliance with former RPC 1.14. At the time, Mr. Tate knew that he was misappropriating client funds, not placing advance fees into his trust account, and commingling personal funds with client funds. Prior to submitting a February 21, 2007, declaration, Mr. Tate knew that his accountant had not yet been able to create client ledgers or a check register for his trust account and that the Bar Association had filed a formal complaint alleging trust account violations in October 2006. Mr. Tate provided false, deceptive, and misleading testimony to the Bar Association. Unreasonable Fees: Between 2004 and 2005, Mr. Tate used a handwritten log to keep track of tasks he performed for clients. However, he routinely did not record the amount of time that he spent on tasks contemporaneously. When Mr. Tate generated billing records for services provided on an hourly fee basis, a substantial amount of the time he billed and the dates on which he indicated services were rendered were based on speculation. Mr. Tateâ€™s method for billing clients for services resulted in billing excessive hours that exceeded the time reflected in his handwritten logs.Mahler Reduction: Mr. Tate was aware that insurers seeking reimbursement of PIP In personal injury cases are required to contribute a share of the legal expenses pursuant to a Supreme Court decision (Mahler reduction). Between 2003 and May 2005, Mr. Tate intentionally paid himself the Mahler reduction on six different occasions, totaling $12,573.90, without the knowledge or consent of his clients, and when the Mahler reduction didnâ€™t apply to a matter. Mr. Tateâ€™s settlement statements intentionally reflected that the entire PIP claim was deducted from the settlement and earmarked to pay the insurance carriers. One client sued Mr. Tate and, in September 2007, he issued a check returning her Mahler reduction. In May 2005, Mr. Tate temporarily ceased taking the Mahler reduction. He began charging a contingent fee on the Mahler reduction in 2006, even though his fee agreement did not provide for the additional fee and he knew the reduction did not apply in some cases. Mr. Tate did not return any of the fees he charged relating to the Mahler reduction until after the Bar Association deposed him on the subject. Client Matters: Between 2004 and early 2006, in eight separate matters, Mr. Tate engaged in the following conduct: â€¢ In one matter, Mr. Tate misappropriated $4,444.47 and concealed the misappropriation by providing false and misleading testimony during Bar Association proceedings and by omitting documentation regarding the check from the clientâ€™s file during discovery.â€¢ In five matters, Mr. Tate deposited advance fees, totaling between $4,831.25 and $30,000, into his general business account and used the funds before they were fully earned. In a fifth matter, Mr. Tate converted $3,000 of advance fees from his IOLTA trust account and spent it for personal purposes.â€¢ In several matters, Mr. Tate created billing statements containing inflated and fabricated charges, which he used to deceptively obtain attorneyâ€™s fees and interest from clients and others.â€¢ Mr. Tate submitted declarations and exhibits containing false and deceptive statements to a county personnel board in one matter, and filed false and deceptive pleadings to Superior Court in a second matter.â€¢ In a personal injury matter, where the client sustained a serious head injury that resulted from a hit-and-run driver, Mr. Tate failed to competently investigate potential liable parties.â€¢ In two personal injury matters, including the previous matter, Mr. Tate charged unreasonable and excessive charges in connection with attorneyâ€™s liens he asserted in each matter.â€¢ Mr. Tate failed to provide clients with an accounting in two matters notwithstanding requests and, in a third matter, failed to return unearned advance fees or provide the client with a copy of their file after withdrawing from representation. â€¢ Mr. Tate engaged in conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.Mr. Tateâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in senting a client; RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable; former RPC 1.5(c)(2), requiring that a contingent fee consisting of a percentage of the monetary amount recovered for a claimant, in which all or part of the recovery is to be paid in the future, be paid only (i) by applying the percentage to the amounts recovered as they are received by the client or (ii) by applying the percentage to the actual cost of the settlement or award to the defendant; former RPC 1.14(a) and (c), requiring that all funds paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts; former RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 1.15A(a), (b), and (c), prohibiting a lawyer from using, converting, borrowing, or pledging client or third-person property for the lawyerâ€™s own use and requiring that all property of clients or third persons in a lawyerâ€™s possession in connection with a representation be held separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property; RPC 1.15A(e), requiring a lawyer to promptly provide a written accounting to a client or third person after distribution of property or upon request; RPC 1.16(d), requiring that, upon termination of representation, a lawyer take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred; RPC 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or failing to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer; former RPC 3.3(a)(4) and current RPC 3.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from offering false evidence; former RPC 3.3(c), requiring a lawyer who has offered material evidence and comes to know of its falsity to promptly disclose this fact to the tribunal; RPC 8.4(b) prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (by violating RCW 9A.56.020) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respect; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; and RPC 8.4(n), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law.Jonathan H.

Mr. Castelda neglected to obtain informed consent in writing from any of the plaintiffs to represent A and B against C. Mr. Castelda failed to withdraw from representing any of the plaintiffs until C told him that she would file a grievance against him.

This discipline was based on conduct involving conversion of funds, failure to provide a written accounting, trust account irregularities, dishonesty, and disregard for the rule of law.Client hired Mr. Guffey to represent him in two lawsuits against his former lawyer. Clientâ€™s father advanced Mr. Guffey $10,000 for costs in the first lawsuit. In both cases, the contingent fee agreements provided that Client would pay no fee if there was no recovery. In February 2008, Mr. Guffey informed Client that he would have to withdraw from both cases for health reasons. Mr. Guffey refunded $4,726.42 of the advance for costs. Mr. Guffey did not provide an accounting of the costs, even though Clientâ€™s father requested one. In April 2008, Mr. Guffey informed Client that his health had recovered sufficiently to resume representation of him in the two lawsuits. Clientâ€™s father wrote a check for $25,000, which was an advance for costs in the two lawsuits. Mr. Guffey deposited the check into his trust account on April 24, 2008. Between April 24, 2008, and November 18, 2008, Mr. Guffey removed, or caused to be removed, approximately $24,995 without entitlement. Some of the funds were withdrawn by Mr. Guffeyâ€™s employee, who is not a lawyer, by way of checks made out to â€œcash.â€ Mr. Guffey knew that the funds were removed from Clientâ€™s trust account without entitlement.On October 2, 2008, the court entered a summary judgment against Client on the claims in the second lawsuit. In February 2009, Mr. Guffey settled the claims in the first lawsuit for $15,000. He mailed the full amount to Clientâ€™s father. Client repeatedly requested an itemization of costs expended on his behalf. Mr. Guffey did not respond to any of these requests or provide an accounting of the funds that he removed from Clientâ€™s funds in his trust account.Prior to April 18, 2009, Client told Mr. Guffey that he would file a bar complaint, and possibly a criminal complaint, if Mr. Guffey did not refund his costs. Mr. Guffey refused to refund any of the funds that he had removed from the Clientâ€™s funds in his trust account. On April 18, 2009, Mr. Guffey resigned from the Bar Association. In his resignation letter, Mr. Guffey stated, â€œI certify that there is no disciplinary proceeding against me and that I have no personal knowledge that the filing of a complaint of substance is imminent.â€ This statement was false.

1566.html,27799,Edward Lane,,Resignation in Lieu of Disbarment,3/25/2011,,"Edward Lawrence Lane (WSBA No. 27799, admitted 1998), of Bellevue, resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective March 25, 2011. This resignation was based on conduct in two matters involving conversion of client funds, trust account irregularities, and dishonesty.While not admitting to the misconduct herein, Mr. Lane agreed that the Bar Association could prove, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, the violations set forth in the Statement of Alleged Misconduct. Those violations are as follows:Mr. Lane handled the trust and operating accounts for his law firm. In March 2009, the firm received a $400,000 settlement check for a client's personal injury claims, which Mr. Lane deposited into the firm's trust account. Mr. Lane began disbursing part of the settlement in March, but did not provide the client with a settlement statement until August 2009. Mr. Lane also did not promptly remit to the client her entire portion of the settlement, which totaled $209,980.70. Instead, the client received $10,000 in March 2009, $10,000 in May 2009, $10,000 in June 2009, and the remaining balance in August 2009. In addition, instead of promptly withdrawing the firmâ€™s attorney fees, totaling $133,333.33, from the trust account, Mr. Lane transferred the firm's earned fees to its operating account in increments, ultimately transferring more from the trust account than the amount of earned fees on deposit. The amounts in excess of earned fees derived, in part, from the client's share of funds in the trust account, which Mr. Lane knowingly borrowed to pay the firm's expenses (e.g., payroll, rent, taxes, etc.), without the clientâ€™s knowledge or authority. Mr. Lane repaid the trust account when funds in the operating account became available. As of August 13, 2009, there was only $167,847.73 on deposit in the trust account, instead of the $179,980.70 of the client funds that the law firm should have been holding. Thus, the firmâ€™s trust account was short $12,132.97.In August 2009, the client asked to be paid the balance of her settlement proceeds. Mr. Lane deposited $10,000 of his own funds into the trust account and, the same day, issued two checks from the trust account to the client, one for $176,980.70 and one for $3,000.00. Mr. Lane anticipated that the larger check would take longer clear the account because the client intended to use it to pay off her mortgage. The client submitted the check to her mortgage company the next day and, because the client's mortgage was held by the same bank as Mr. Laneâ€™s trust account, the bank immediately transferred $176,980.70 from the trust account to pay off the client's mortgage. The bank declined to honor the $3,000 check due to insufficient funds in the account. The next day, Mr. Lane transferred $2,500 from the law firm's operating account to the trust account and subsequently advised the client to resubmit the $3,000 check for payment at the bank, which the bank cleared.Similarly, in another client matter, Mr. Lane failed to maintain the clientâ€™s $13,299.19 of settlement in the firmâ€™s trust account, and withdrew portions of it to pay some of the firm's operating expenses (e.g., payroll, rent, taxes, etc.), without the clientâ€™s knowledge or authority. Mr. Lane ultimately disbursed the funds to which the client and his ex-wife were entitled from the firm's operating account.Mr. Laneâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.15A(b), prohibiting a lawyer from using, converting, borrowing or pledging client or third person property for the lawyer's own use; RPC 1.15A(c), requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients and third persons separate from the lawyer's own property; RPC 1.15A(e), requiring a lawyer to promptly provide a written accounting to a client or third person after distribution of property or upon request; RPC 1.15A(f), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client or third person the property which the client or third person is entitled to receive; RPC 1.15A(h)(1), prohibiting funds belonging to a lawyer to be deposited or retained in a trust account except funds to pay bank charges, funds belonging in part to the lawyer, and funds necessary to restore appropriate balances in the account; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.Leslie C.

Cross (WSBA No. 3089, admitted 1968), of Tacoma, was reprimanded following approval of a stipulation by order of a hearing officer on February 8, 2011. This discipline is based on conduct involving a conflict of interest.In February 2008, Mr. Cross appeared in King County Superior Court for a client who was charged with Theft of a Motor Vehicle. The client told Mr. Cross that his relative, FS, who had multiple felony convictions, was the perpetrator of the crime. FS had been charged a month earlier with Theft of a Motor Vehicle in Kitsap County Superior Court. Mr. Cross directed an investigator to obtain documents from the Kitsap County Court file, which he provided to his client and the police. Mr. Cross told the police that it was FS who had committed the crime in the King County case.Later, FS was arrested in Kitsap County on a warrant issued in the Kitsap County case. FS asked Mr. Cross to represent him. Mr. Cross told FS he could not represent him due to a conflict of interest, but an associate employed at his firm, where Mr. Cross was the principal, could represent him. Mr. Cross represented his client until he was discharged by the client in December 2008, and his associate represented FS until May 2009. Neither Mr. Crossâ€™ client nor FS gave their informed consent, confirmed in writing, to any conflict of interest related to the two cases. Even after Mr. Cross was discharged, his client continued to maintain that FS was the perpetrator of the crime in the King County Court matter, and the victim later identified FS as the perpetrator of that crime.Mr. Crossâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.10(a), stating that, while lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7 [Conflict of Interest, Current Clients] or 1.9 [Duties to Former Clients].Scott G.

1572.html,12606,Deborah Clark,,Resignation in Lieu of Disbarment,5/11/2011,,"Deborah Jean Clark (WSBA No. 12606, admitted 1982), of Lake Stevens, resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective May 11, 2011. Ms. Clark affirmatively admitted that if the matter were to proceed to a public hearing, there is a substantial likelihood the Bar Association could prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence the facts and misconduct, and that proof of such misconduct would suffice to result in disbarment, but did not affirmatively admit to the facts and misconduct herein. This resignation is based on conduct involving failure to act diligently, failure to communicate,and conflicts of interest.According to the Statement of Misconduct: Ms. Clark drafted a will for a client, who died in January 1995. Decedentâ€™s will left the bulk of his estate to a testamentary trust(hereinafter â€œTrustâ€) for the benefit of his daughter, who was born in 1987, and designated his friend as Trustee. The provisions drafted by Ms. Clark directed Trustee to only make investments that he considered to be â€œsafeâ€ investments. Trustee hired Ms. Clark to represent him in his capacity as Trustee of the Trust and relied completely on Ms. Clark to advise him about his duties.Ms. Clarkâ€™s legal practice focused on real estate transactions. After a period of time, Ms. Clark effectively exercised complete control over the Trust assets and began using those assets to make loans as a â€œhard moneyâ€ lender to people she knew, many of whom could not qualify for more conventional financing. Ms. Clarkâ€™s loan fees were paid from the loan proceeds. Ms. Clarkâ€™s misconduct involving the Trust, and her representation of other clients who borrowed funds from the Trust or lent funds with competing security interests, includes the following:--Ms. Clark failed to advise the Trustee of safe investments as provided for in the Trust documents, failed to promptly record two deeds of trust to secure loans from the Trust, failed to collect the full amount of interest due on loans from the Trust, failed to properly compute interest owed to the Trust, and prepared and executed subordination agreements that were not in the Trustâ€™s best interests.--Ms. Clark failed to fully and properly inform the Trustee about the risky nature of the loans being made by Ms. Clark on behalf of the Trust, the risk of subordinating the Trustâ€™s securityinterest in loan collateral, and the Trusteeâ€™s exposure to liability for not adequately supervising the investment of funds from the Trust.--Ms. Clark had the Trustee and other clients, to whom she loaned funds from the Trust, sign notices regarding conflict of interest that inaccurately reflected that Ms. Clark was only appearing as an escrow officer in transactions when, in fact, she acted in arepresentative capacity.--Ms. Clark concurrently represented the Trust and four other clients with loans that had competing security interests in the same collateral.--Ms. Clark made personal loans whose security interests competed with the loans of her clients and acted as a listing agent for thereal property that secured the loans between the Trust and one of her clients.--Ms. Clark acquired security interests in the real property that were adverse to the interest of the Trust, without complying with the provisions of RPC 1.8(a).Ms. Clarkâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former and current RPC 1.4(a) and (b), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.7(a), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest and if the representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client, or there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person, or by a personal interest of the lawyer; RPC 1.7(b), allowing a lawyer to represent a client, notwithstanding the existence of a concurrent conflict of interest, if the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client, the representation is not prohibited by law, the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same litigation or other proceeding before a tribunal, and each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing; RPC 1.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer from entering into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquiring an ownership, possessory, security, or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless the transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the client, the client is advised in writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel on the transaction, and the client gives informed consent, in a writing signed by the client, to the essential terms of the transaction and the lawyerâ€™s role in the transaction; and RPC 1.8(b), prohibiting a lawyer from using information relating to representation of a client to the disadvantage of the client unless the client gives informed consent.Jonathan H.

1573.html,15275,Douglas Ferrer,,Suspension,3/1/2010,,"Douglas Paul Ferrer (WSBA No. 15275, admitted 1985), of Seattle, was suspended for 18 months, effective March 1, 2010, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to act competently, lack of diligence, failure to communicate, and dishonesty.In April 1992, Clients were involved in a head-on collision with a drunk driver (opposing party). In August 1992, Clients hired Mr. Ferrer to represent them in litigation against the opposing party. Mr. Ferrer prepared the complaint, but did not file it until April 1995. This was two days before the statute of limitations expired. Mr. Ferrer failed to file additional required pleadings. In June 1995, Clientsâ€™ insurance company offered to pay the $100,000 limit on Clientsâ€™ uninsured motorist policy. Mr. Ferrer knew about this offer, but did not communicate it to his clients. As a consequence, Clients were not aware of their insurance companyâ€™s offer until 2005.In March 1995, Clientsâ€™ case was dismissed by the court for failure to file the required pleadings. On March 15, 1996, Mr. Ferrer appeared in court and requested that the complaint be reinstated, which the court allowed. The trial date was set for March 1997. Mr. Ferrer failed to notify Clients that a trial date had been set and did not appear for trial. By this time, the opposing party had served his prison term, left the state, and could not be located. Mr. Ferrer never sought a default judgment against him. In October 1997, the trial court again dismissed the case due to abandonment. In the following years, Clients placed between 10â€“15 phone calls to Mr. Ferrer, who continued to tell them their matter was pending even though he knew this was false. In 2005, Clients learned from the clerkâ€™s office that their complaint had been dismissed in 1997 and confronted Mr. Ferrer, who told them that he would seek to have the case reinstated. Mr. Ferrer did not take any further action. Clients hired new counsel to represent them in a lawsuit against Mr. Ferrer. Their new counsel learned that Mr. Ferrer had taken no action on the insurance companyâ€™s payment offer and was able to recover the payment. Clients sued Mr. Ferrer for malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty, and sought damages in the form of the interest on the $100,000. Mr. Ferrer admitted liability, but asked the court to reduce the damage amount based upon his argument that the damages should be reduced by the amount of his original contingency fee, 40 percent. The court held that Mr. Ferrer was not entitled to have the amount reduced. Mr. Ferrerâ€™s conduct in the matter demonstrated that he did not understand the most fundamental legal procedures relating to personal injury cases.Mr. Ferrerâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a)(3), requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.

Villager (WSBA No. 36837, admitted 2005), of Seattle, was disbarred, effective May 17, 2011, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct involving misappropriation of client funds and dishonesty. While not admitting to the misconduct, Ms. Villager admits that the Association could prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence the violations set forth in the Stipulated Facts and that proof of such violations would suffice to result in her disbarment. According to the Stipulated Facts:In May 2008, Insurance Company A hired the law firm where Ms. Villager was employed to enforce several hundred judgments and unresolved claims arising from motor vehicle accidents. Between May 2008 and August 2009, Ms. Villager worked on these matters by negotiating lump-sum settlements and establishing payment plans with Insurance Company Aâ€™s debtors. During that time, Ms. Villager filed Satisfactions of Judgments in six matters after debtors in those matters delivered to Ms. Villager checks, ranging from between $2,412.38 and $10,000.00, to satisfy the judgments against them. Neither Insurance Company A nor Ms. Villagerâ€™s employer received any funds in satisfaction of the judgments and Ms. Villager did not tell them that the matters had been settled.In late September 2008, Ms. Villager filed a complaint in another matter against a defendant on behalf of Insurance Company A. The defendant delivered a cashierâ€™s check to Ms. Villager for $4,200 as she instructed and received a signed proposed order of dismissal, which the defendant filed with the court. On October 14, 2008, the court dismissed the case. Neither Insurance Company A nor Ms. Villagerâ€™s employer received any portion of the settlement funds and Ms. Villager did not tell them that the matter had been settled. In late September and/or early October 2008, Ms. Villager met with two different defendants who had separate complaints filed against each of them by Insurance Company A. The defendants each brought to Ms. Villager between $1,000 and $2,900 to settle the cases against them. Ms. Villager provided a receipt to one of the defendants, although she did not use her employerâ€™s receipt book. The court entered an order dismissing that matter with prejudice. Ms. Villager gave the second defendant a proposed dismissal order, which he took to court to get the case against him dismissed. Neither Insurance Company A nor Ms. Villagerâ€™s employer received any portion of the settlement funds, and Ms. Villager did not tell them that the matters had been settled.In January 2009, Ms. Villager filed a lawsuit on behalf of Insurance Company A against Insurance Company B, seeking $16,418.53 in unpaid intercompany arbitration awards. Insurance Company Bâ€™s lawyer advised Ms. Villager that it would seek summary judgment. In response, Ms. Villager signed and forwarded a proposed order of dismissal. Insurance Company A had not agreed to any such â€œsettlement.â€ Ms. Villager did not tell her employer or Insurance Company A that she had dismissed their claim against Insurance Company B.Ms. Villagerâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.15A, prohibiting a lawyer from using, converting, borrowing, or pledging for their own use property of clients or third persons in a lawyerâ€™s possession in connection with a representation; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Linda B.

Contreras (WSBA No. 15181, admitted 1985), of Bellevue, was disbarred, effective May 27, 2011, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. Ms. Contreras affirmatively admitted that if the matter were to proceed to a public hearing, there is a substantial likelihood the Bar Association could prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence the facts and misconduct, and that proof of such misconduct would suffice to result in disbarment, but did not affirmatively admit to the facts and misconduct herein. This discipline is based on conduct involving trust account irregularities, conversion of client funds, failure to protect clientsâ€™ interests, dishonesty, acts which reflect disregard for the rule of law, and violations of the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct. According to the stipulation: Trust Accounts: Ms. Contreras was a solo practitioner who practiced primarily in family and personal injury law. She maintained a trust account at one bank and, in June 2008, opened a second trust account at a different bank. Ms. Contreras personally made all deposits and withdrawals from her trust accounts and maintained all trust account records. On 10 occasions between June 2005 and July 2007, checks issued from one trust account, ranging from $500 to $5,115.44, were paid against insufficient funds resulting in negative balances. On seven occasions between December 2005 and January 2008, checks issued from one trust account, ranging from $800 to $4,670, were dishonored and returned due to insufficient funds. Ms. Contreras did not report any of these overdrafts to the Association. Between June 2005 and February 2009,Ms. Contreras failed to maintain complete or accurate records on one or both of her trust accounts. On several occasions, Ms. Contreras withdrew funds from her trust account by cash withdrawals without identifying a client matter for the withdrawals, converted client funds to her own use, and allowed substantial shortages of client funds, ranging from $19,811.99 to $160,436.88, in one of her two trust accounts.Conversion of Client Funds: Ms. Contreras converted funds to her own use by not depositing checks into her trust account, by paying herself in excess of what she earned, and by repeatedly using funds of one client to pay the obligations of another. Between November 2005 and January 2009, Ms. Contreras converted funds belonging to at least eight different clients, ranging between $845 and $26,508.57, in order to pay disbursements to other clients or pay herself. The disbursements often left Ms. Contrerasâ€™s trust account with negative balances.Non-Cooperation: In April 2007, the Bar Association opened a grievance against Ms. Contreras based on two overdrafts in one of her trust accounts. During the investigation of the grievance, Ms. Contreras failed to fully respond to the Associationâ€™s requests for information or records and failed to produce all of the information requested. During six depositions in which she was subpoenaed by the Bar Association, Ms. Contreras gave false testimony and produced false and misleading records, including a fabricated â€œTransmittal Memo.â€ Client Matters: In March 2008, Client A hired Ms. Contreras to represent him in a paternity case and paid her a $3,000 flat fee. Client A discharged Ms. Contreras the next month and hired another lawyer to take over his case. On several occasions, Client A and his new lawyer asked Ms. Contreras for an accounting and refund. She did not provide either until after Client A filed a grievance against her. In January 2009, Ms. Contreras issued a check for $3,000 to Client A from her trust account using settlement funds she received from another clientâ€™s settlement to fund the check.In September 2009, Client B hired Ms. Contreras to represent her in her dissolution and paid an advance fee of $1,500 by check. Ms. Contreras did not deposit the advance fee to a trust account, but instead negotiated the check for cash before she had earned any of the fees. A week after hiring her, Client B discharged Ms. Contreras and requested a refund. Although Ms. Contreras agreed to refund the advance fee, she did not do so. Client B filed a small claims action and obtained a judgment against Ms. Contreras in the amount of $1,573. Client B also filed a grievance against Ms. Contreras, who failed to submit any response. The Bar Association served Ms. Contreras with a subpoena for deposition. During the deposition, Ms. Contreras testified that she planned to refund Client Bâ€™s money the next day, but did not do so. Instead, she refunded her $690 on March 20, 2010; $500 on March 21, 2010; and $390 on March 23, 2010.Ms. Contrerasâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer be deposited into one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and maintained pursuant to the Rules; former RPC 1.14(b)(3) and current RPC 1.15A(h)(2), requiring a lawyer to keep complete records pursuant to the Rules; former RPC 1.14(b)(4) and current RPC 1.15A(f), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client or third person the property which the client or third person is entitled to receive; RPC 1.15A(b), prohibiting a lawyer from using, converting, borrowing, or pledging client or third-person property for the lawyerâ€™s own use; RPC 1.15A(h)(3), requiring a lawyer to provide written notice to his or her clients before withdrawing earned fees from his or her trust account; RPC 1.15A(h)(5), requiring that all withdrawals from a trust account be made only to a named payee and not to cash; RPC 1.15A(h)(6), requiring trust account records to be reconciled as often as bank statements are generated or at least quarterly; RPC 1.15A(h)(8), prohibiting disbursements on behalf of a client or third person from exceeding the funds of that person on deposit; RPC 1.15B, requiring a lawyer to maintain current trust account records and listing, at minimum, what the records must include; RPC 1.16(d), requiring a lawyer, upon termination of representation, to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.

This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to provide competent representation, failure to act with reasonable diligence, failure to communicate, failure to provide a client with a settlement statement, conflict of interest, trust account irregularities, conversion of clientsâ€™ funds, the commission of criminal acts, dishonest conduct, and conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law. Alan Mark Singer is to be distinguished from Alan Michael Singer of Olympia.Between November 2005 and January 2010, Mr. Singer engaged in the following conduct:â€¢ Deposited unearned advance fees, totaling between $1,420 and $9,500, from three clients into his general account instead of his trust account;â€¢ In two matters, one involving a client with a disability and one a minor client, unlawfully converted clientsâ€™ funds to pay himself and third parties;â€¢ Converted funds sent him as a refund for a client, even after the Bar Association informed Mr. Singer that the money belonged to the client; â€¢ Failed to render appropriate accounts to two clients regarding the disbursement of their funds from his trust account, and misrepresented in a billing statement to one of the clients the true nature of a payment made to a third party;â€¢ Failed to promptly pay a client settlement money owed to her or to provide her with a settlement statement;â€¢ Solicited, purchased, and obtained controlled substances from a client, and continued to represent the client in his criminal matter after having committed criminal acts with him and without obtaining informed consents regarding the resulting conflict of interest; and â€¢ Failed to competently represent two clients in their matters due to physical and mental impairment, and failed to inform clients about his impairment, which in part was caused by Mr. Singerâ€™s non-prescribed drug use. Mr. Singerâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(c)(3), requiring a lawyer, upon conclusion of a contingent fee matter, to provide the client with a written statement stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is a recovery, showing the remittance to the client and the method of its determination; RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting the lawyer from representing a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest unless the affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring a lawyer to deposit all funds of a client paid to a lawyer or law firm, in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts maintained as set forth in the rules; former RPC 1.14(b)and current RPC 1.15A, requiring a lawyer to promptly notify a client of receipt of his or her funds, maintain complete records of all funds of a client coming into the possession of a lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them, and promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by the client funds in the possession of the lawyer the client is entitled to receive; RPC 1.15A(b), prohibiting a lawyer from using, converting, or pledging the clientâ€™s property for the lawyerâ€™s own use; RPC 1.15A(c), requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients and third persons separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, possession of controlled substance) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(n), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law.

1587.html,5385,W. Van Camp,,Disbarment,6/16/2011,,"W. Russell Van Camp (WSBA No. 5385, admitted 1973), of Spokane, was disbarred, effective June 16, 2011, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation, failure to act with reasonable diligence, failure to communicate, charging unreasonable fees, failure to explain to client how fees will be calculated, and dishonest conduct. For more information, see In re Van Camp, 171 Wn.2d 781, 257 P.3d 599 (2011).On December 15, 2006, a client hired Mr. Van Camp to represent him in an injunction suit brought against the client in federal court. Mr. Van Camp required the client to pay to him a $25,000 initial â€œretainerâ€ fee, but did not explain to the client how the fee would be calculated or whether it was refundable. The fee agreement stated, â€œMonies paid by the client shall be considered as earned towards the ultimate total fee, unless otherwise designated.â€ But the meaning of â€œearned retainerâ€ was not explained, nor was the scope of representation defined. The client was not given a copy of the fee agreement.The same day, Mr. Van Camp phoned opposing counsel. He joked that opposing counsel should send him a box of chocolates to thank him for all the money he would make on this case. Later that day, opposing counsel faxed Mr. Van Camp a letter that mentioned â€œthe box of chocolatesâ€ remark as tongue-in-cheek, and also referenced a settlement offer and proposed permanent injunction as attached; however, the attachment was not transmitted with the letter.The letter referenced opposing partyâ€™s desire to quickly resolve the case without further litigation. Mr. Van Camp did not respond to the letter or request the missing attachment, except to call opposing counsel and express displeasure at seeing the â€œchocolatesâ€ remark in writing. Little work was done on the clientâ€™s case. Mr. Van Campâ€™s partner represented the client in a telephonic hearing in which a preliminary injunction against the client was granted. Mr. Van Camp performed no work in response to the preliminary injunction and did not explain its significance to the client. In February 2007, opposing counsel sought a response from Mr. Van Camp to his December 15, 2006, letter. Mr. Van Camp did not respond. Mr. Van Camp participated in a telephonic scheduling conference in March 2007, with a resulting discovery deadline of September 10, 2007, but no discovery was prepared on the clientâ€™s behalf until late August.In early March 2007, the client sent Mr. Van Camp a letter expressing his desire that the case be resolved as quickly as possible. The client also requested copies of documents filed in his case and an itemized bill showing what charges had been made against the retainer. A week later, Mr. Van Camp replied to the client that â€œour retainer agreement was for an earned retainer (flat fee)â€¦.â€ The client and his wife continued to request documents, including any document stating that the $25,000 was a flat fee. They emailed Mr. Van Camp seeking to discuss the claims against them, the steps being taken, and to obtain a copy of the retainer agreement. Mr. Van Camp did not respond.In July 2007, Mr. Van Camp filed an answer to the complaint, which included a counterclaim against the opposing party. At an attempted mediation in July 2007, the mediator mentioned opposing partyâ€™s settlement offer. This surprised the client, who was unfamiliar with the offer. The mediation was unsuccessful. Afterwards, the client continued to email Mr. Van Camp seeking copies of anything filed and reiterating his desire to resolve the case quickly. Following receipt of the few documents that Mr. Van Camp could provide, including an altered copy of the opposing counselâ€™s December 15, 2006, letter, the client sought a copy of the proposed permanent injunction referenced in the letter. Mr. Van Camp could not provide this, as he never informed opposing counsel that the injunction itself was not attached.After the client filed a grievance against Mr. Van Camp on July 31, 2007, Mr. Van Camp sent the client an apologetic letter and asked him whether he should pursue settlement. In his response to the Bar Association, Mr. Van Camp stated he had done enough work to earn most of the retainer fee. He told the Bar Association that, if the case settled, he would be happy to review the retainer fee with the client and refund some of it, but he did not offer this directly to the client. In August 2007, the client again requested a copy of the permanent injunction and settlement offer from opposing counsel, and continued to express his desire to settle the matter. Although Mr. Van Camp now had a copy of the permanent injunction and settlement offer, he did not provide it to the client.At the end of August 2007, Mr. Van Camp scheduled and completed one deposition. This was the only discovery completed on behalf of the clientâ€™s counterclaim. On August 31, 2007, the client fired Mr. Van Camp. The client again sought a statement of actual costs incurred and a refund of the remainder of the retainer, neither of which he received. The client contacted opposing counsel directly. The client took a copy of the proposed permanent injunction to a new attorney, who was able to settle the lawsuit. The lawsuit was dismissed in September 2007. The new attorney charged the client a total of $500. During the Bar Association investigation, Mr. Van Camp submitted differing and exaggerated time reconstructions based on hours he claimed to have worked in order to justify the amount of his fee. Mr. Van Camp had little or no work to show for it.Mr. Van Campâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to promptly inform the client of any decision of circumstance with respect to which the clientâ€™s informed consent is required by these Rules, reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the clientâ€™s objectives are to be accomplished, keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer toexplain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an unreasonable fee; RPC 1.5(b), requiring the lawyer to communicate to the client the scope of the representation and the basis or rate of the fee and expenses for which the client will be responsible, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Natalea Skvir represented the Bar Association at the hearing.

This discipline was based on conduct involving violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, misrepresentation, and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. On May 21, 2009, the Washington State Supreme Court entered an Order of Suspension against Mr. Adame for nonpayment of licensing fees and failure to file a Professional Responsibility Disclosure Form. The effective date of Mr. Adameâ€™s suspension was June 1, 2009. On May 26, 2009, an assistant in Mr. Adameâ€™s office signed a certified mail receipt indicating that Mr. Adame acknowledged receipt of a letter from the Washington State Bar Association advising him of the suspension. After the effective date of his suspension, Mr. Adame appeared in court on two matters over two days, including representing a client in a plea and sentencing hearing. Mr. Adame immediately discontinued the practice of law upon receiving notice of his suspension from a colleague. On his â€œApplication for Change of Membership Status to Activeâ€ submitted to the Association in late June 2009 in support of reinstatement, Mr. Adame certified that he had not engaged in the practice of law in Washington during the period of his suspension. Mr. Adame knew at the time of making this certification that this was not a true statement. The hearing officer found that Mr. Adameâ€™s conduct violated RPC 5.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in the practice of law while on inactive status, or while suspended from the practice of law for any cause; RPC 8.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct; RPC8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.

1590.html,27407,Nicholas Matarangas,,Disbarment,7/7/2011,,"Nicholas R. Matarangas (WSBA No. 27407, admitted 1997), of Seattle, was disbarred, effective July 7, 2011, and September 16, 2011, by orders of the Washington State Supreme Court following two separate default hearings. The July 7, 2011, disbarment was based on conduct involving failure to act with reasonable diligence, failure to communicate, conversion of client property, trust account irregularities, failure to promptly notify a client of receipt of clientâ€™s property, failure to promptly pay a client funds she was entitled to receive, failure to keep complete trust account records, theft, and dishonest conduct. The September 16, 2011, disbarment was based on conduct involving failure to act diligently in a client matter, failure to maintain client funds in a trust account, theft of client funds, failure to protect a clientâ€™s interests, and failure to cooperate in a Bar Association investigation. July 7, 2011, disbarment: Client A was a Missouri resident injured while on vacation in Washington. In November 2004, Client A hired Mr. Matarangas, a solo practitioner, to represent her in her personal injury claim. Under their contingent fee agreement, Mr. Matarangas was to receive 35 percent of any settlement amount if a lawsuit was commenced before settlement. Client Aâ€™s insurance paid $4,337.40 toward her medical expenses, which needed to be reimbursed to a subrogation service.After Mr. Matarangas filed suit on Client Aâ€™s behalf, the parties reached a settlement for $25,000. On April 10, 2009, Client A signed a receipt and release of her claim. That same day, Mr. Matarangas endorsed and deposited the settlement check into his trust account and wrote himself a trust account check for $8,750, which represented 35 percent of Client Aâ€™s settlement. Mr. Matarangas should have maintained $16,250 in his trust account for disbursement to Client A, the subrogation service, and to pay costs. He neither informed Client A of his receipt of her settlement funds, nor of his withdrawal of his fee. On May 4, 2009, Mr. Matarangas wrote a letter to Client A stating, â€œOnce the case is dismissed, [opposing counsel] will tender the check to me which I will deposit to my trust account. Once the check has cleared, I will deduct my fees and costs and pay [the subrogation service] whatever amount we ultimately agree on. I will send the balance to you.â€ At the time he wrote the letter, Mr. Matarangas knew he had already received and deposited the settlement check and taken his fee. Mr. Matarangas thereafter misappropriated the remaining settlement funds, totaling more than $15,000.Over the months following Client Aâ€™s receipt of Mr. Matarangasâ€™s letter, she left him numerousmessages and numerous emails inquiring about the settlement. Mr. Matarangas did not respond to the voicemails, but did respond to one or more of the emails telling Client A that he was working on her case and negotiating with the subrogation service to reduce the amount to be paid in subrogation. He assured her that payment was forthcoming. From April 10, 2009, through May 4, 2010, Mr. Matarangas withdrew approximately $5,500 of the funds from his trust account. Other than his 35 percent fee, Mr. Matarangas was not entitled to any other funds from Client Aâ€™s settlement. A representative from the subrogation service informed Client A that their files showed no contact with Mr. Matarangas after March 2009. In September 2009, Mr. Matarangas was evicted from his leased office space for nonpayment of rent and his address was no longer valid. He did not inform Client A, the subrogation service, or the Bar Association of the change. After Client A filed a grievance against Mr. Matarangas with the Bar Association, Mr. Matarangas sent the subrogation service a check for $2,000 and sent Client A a cashierâ€™s check for $13,188.71, representing the settlement amount less his fee, the subrogation payment, and costs. In his response to the grievance, Mr. Matarangas stated that he had been negotiating to reduce the reimbursement in subrogation and had â€œfelt it would be prudent to hold on to the settlement until the lien issue could be resolved.â€ Following a subpoena issued by the Bar Association for Mr. Matarangas to appear for a deposition and produce his client file on May 20, 2010, Mr. Matarangas appeared but produced no records. Although he agreed under oath to provide the specified records by June 15, 2010, Mr. Matarangas produced no documents. September 16, 2011, disbarment: Client B hired Mr. Matarangas to represent her in connection with a single-car accident. Client Bâ€™s insurance included coverage for personal injury protection (PIP). On January 25, 2010, Client Bâ€™s insurance issued a check for $9,616 to Mr. Matarangas to be used toward Client Bâ€™s medical expenses. Mr. Matarangas informed Client B that he would hold these funds in his trust account for payment of her medical expenses and deposited the check into his trust account.On March 19, 2010, Mr. Matarangas withdrew $2,715.53 from his trust account, which he sent to Client B in a cashierâ€™s check. After this disbursement, $6,900.47 should have remained in Mr. Matarangasâ€™s trust account for eventual payment of Client Bâ€™s medical expenses. Between January 25, 2010, and March 29, 2010, Mr. Matarangas transferred nearly $8,000 from his trust account to a joint personal checking account he maintained with his wife. Most of those funds belonged to Client B. Mr. Matarangas had not signed any fee agreement with Client B, nor had he issued any invoices to her for his services, and was not entitled to withdraw her funds from the trust account. On March 31, 2010, only $23.44 remained in Mr. Matarangasâ€™s trust account.Client B subsequently tried to contact Mr. Matarangas to have him disburse the remaining PIP funds to her medical providers, but found it extremely difficult to reach him. To avoid being sent to collections, Client B hired another attorney, who wrote to Mr. Matarangas at his address of record stating that Client B had asked his firm to substitute as her counsel and requesting that Mr. Matarangas forward her file and PIP funds. He received no response. Client B filed a grievance with the Bar association. The Bar Association sent several letters to Mr. Matarangasâ€™s address of record and to his home, questing a response. Mr. Matarangas did not respond to the grievance nor supply the Bar Association with a valid business address. Mr. Matarangasâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.15A(b), prohibiting a lawyer from using, converting, borrowing, or pledging client or third-person property for the lawyerâ€™s own use; RPC 1.15A(c)(1), requiring a lawyer to deposit and hold in a trust account funds subject to this Rule; RPC 1.15A(d), requiring a lawyer to promptly notify a client of receipt of the clientâ€™s property; RPC 1.15(f), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client the property which the client is entitled to receive; RPC 1.15A(h)(2), requiring a lawyer to keep complete records (of client property) as required by Rule 1.15B; RPC 1.15A(h)(3), allowing a lawyer to withdraw earned fees only after giving reasonable notice to the client of the intent to do so; RPC 1.15A(h)(5), requiring that all (trust account) withdrawals be made to a named payee and not to cash; RPC 1.15A(h)(7), prohibiting a lawyer from disbursing funds from a trust account until deposits have cleared the banking process and been collected; RPC 1.15B, requiring a lawyer to maintain current trust account records and specifying what, at minimum, the records must include; RPC 1.16(a)(3), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the lawyer is discharged; RPC 1.16(d), requiring that, upon termination of representation, a lawyer take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as surrendering papers or property to which the client is entitled; RPC 8.1(b), prohibiting a lawyer, in connection with a disciplinary matter, from knowingly failing to respond to a lawful demand for information; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or representation; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Natalea Skvir represented the Bar Association.

1593.html,33917,A.E.Bud Bailey,,Reprimand,6/28/2011,,"A.E. Bud Bailey (WSBA No. 33917, admitted 2003), of Vancouver, was ordered to receive a reprimand on June 28, 2011, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court imposing reciprocal discipline in accordance with an order of the Supreme Court of the State of Oregon. This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to communicate with a client, failure to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions regarding the representation, and accepting a settlement offer without first communicating that offer to the client or obtaining the clientâ€™s permission. For more information, see the Oregon State Bar Bulletin (May 2011), available at www.osbar.org. Mr. Baileyâ€™s conduct violated Oregonâ€™s RPC 1.2(a) (failure to abide by a clientâ€™s decision whether to settle a matter); and Oregonâ€™s RPC 1.4 (failure to keep a client reasonably informed and to communicate sufficiently to allow the client to make informed decisions).

1595.html,12531,Ben Hankin,,Resignation in Lieu of Disbarment,8/10/2011,,"Ben Lawrence Hankin (WSBA No. 12531, admitted 1982), of Bellevue, resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective August 10, 2011. While not admitting to the misconduct in the Statement of Alleged Misconduct, Mr. Hankin admits that the Association could prove the violations, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, sufficient to result in his disbarment. The violations listed in the Statement of Alleged Misconduct include failure to act with reasonable diligence, failure to communicate, conflicts of interest, failure to diligently comply with a discovery request, failure to ensure that a non-lawyer assistantâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer, and assisting another to engage in the unauthorized practice of law.According to the Statement of Alleged Misconduct:  Attorney K was a member of the Virginia State Bar until 2010 and has never been licensed to practice law in Washington. Since 1985, Mr. Hankin and Attorney K had a business relationship. At times, they shared office space and telephone numbers, and worked together on legal matters. The great majority of Mr. Hankinâ€™s law practice involved providing services for Attorney K, or for entities controlled by Attorney K or his associates. Sometime in 1996, Clients, who owned an Oregon real estate company, hired Attorney K to provide legal representation for their company. In 2002, while negotiating with a bank to obtain a loan for another client (a limited liability company, hereinafter â€œLLC,â€ in which Attorney K also had an interest) Attorney K provided the lender with certain documents allegedly signed by Clients. These documents included a promissory note for $2,568,000, which was provided as a loan guarantee for LLC. LLC defaulted on the loan.In January 2003, the lender sued Clients, claiming they were liable, as guarantors, for the indebtedness owed to them by LLC. In April 2003, the lender filed a Motion for Summary Judgment to establish Clientsâ€™ liability. Clients contacted Attorney K for representation in the suit. Attorney K approached Mr. Hankin to assist in preparing an Answer to the Complaint (â€œAnswerâ€) and a Response to the Motion for Summary Judgment (â€œResponseâ€). Mr. Hankin had never previously represented Clients. At the time, Mr. Hankin limited his law practice to nights and weekends, and was employed full time in a pawnshop. Mr. Hankin met with Attorney K for two weekends at a law library to prepare the Answer and Response. Mr. Hankin knew Attorney K was not a Washington-licensed attorney. Mr. Hankin had never met, spoke, or otherwise corresponded with Clients at any time during the representation and did not obtain their authority to act as their lawyer. He relied solely on Attorney K to provide him with â€œfactsâ€ and documents relating to the bank loan. Mr. Hankin never consulted Clients to ascertain if Attorney Kâ€™s â€œfactsâ€ were accurate and never personally reviewed the executed promissory note. Attorney K and Mr. Hankin handwrote a draft Answer and Response. Both the Answer and Response included admissions that Clients had executed the promissory note for $2,568,000 payable to the lender. The admissions minimized Attorney Kâ€™s involvement and potential liability in the matter, and exposed Clients to a multimillion dollar judgment. Attorney K, or someone at his direction, prepared and finalized the Answer and Response outside of Mr. Hankinâ€™s presence and without his supervision. Attorney K met Mr. Hankin at the pawnshop to have him sign the pleadings. Mr. Hankin briefly reviewed the pleadings before signing the documents, but made no edits, and left Attorney K with the responsibility of filing them. Mr. Hankin allowed Attorney K to retain all notes, legal research, work product, and documents associated with the case, while not keeping any files of his own. On April 29, 2003, the Answer and Response were filed under the wrong cause number without Mr. Hankinâ€™s supervision or knowledge. Mr. Hankinâ€™s representation of Clients effectively ended after the preparation and filing of the Answer and Response. During his representation of Clients, Mr. Hankin made no efforts to communicate with Clients regarding factual and legal defenses, did not discuss settlement options with them, and did not contact opposing counsel or request relevant documents from the bank. Mr. Hankin knowingly abdicated his duty to provide independent legal advice to them. Before undertaking the representation, Mr. Hankin did not disclose to Clients that he had previously represented Attorney K or his associates, or that he had an ongoing business relationship with him. Mr. Hankin did not disclose that his representation of them could be materially limited by his responsibilities to Attorney K and by his own interest in maintaining a business relationship with him. Mr. Hankin did not obtain written waivers from Clients regarding the conflicts of interest.In May 2003, Clients requested that Mr. Hankin attend a meeting scheduled between the bank and defendants in the suit. Mr. Hankin did not respond to their request, appear at the meeting, or otherwise contact them at any point regarding the bank litigation. Sometime in May 2003, Clients hired new counsel. On May 29, 2003, the Court granted the bankâ€™s summary judgment motion. The court order granting the motion states that the documentation reviewed by the court included both Mr. Hankinâ€™s response to the summary judgment motion and the supplemental response filed by Clientsâ€™ new counsel. A judgment of approximately $2,700,000 was entered against Clients in favor of the bank.On June 27, 2003, Clients filed suit against Attorney K for breach of fiduciary duty and legal malpractice in federal court in Oregon. On June 30, 2004, pursuant to court subpoena, Mr. Hankin appeared for a deposition taken by Clientsâ€™ counsel in the federal suit, but did not produce any of the documents subpoenaed. Mr. Hankin refused to answer almost all questions presented to him, instead invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege against incrimination. Mr. Hankin attempted to assert a blanket privilege, refusing even to answer questions which subjected him to no criminal liability. After invoking the privilege approximately 20 times, Mr. Hankin and his counsel walked out of the deposition. Clientsâ€™ counsel subsequently filed a Motion for Order Compelling Discovery and for Sanctions against Mr. Hankin for his conduct during the deposition, which the Court granted. The Court found that Mr. Hankinâ€™s conduct was only intended â€œto frustrate the deposition process.â€ The Court later entered a judgment of $16,005.23 against Mr. Hankin and his counsel for their conduct during the deposition. On December 14, 2004, Mr. Hankin finally appeared for his deposition. Mr. Hankinâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a)(2), requiring a lawyer to reasonably consult with a client about the means by which the clientâ€™s objectives are to be accomplished; RPC 1.4(a)(3), requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter; RPC 1.4(a)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.7(a), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest; RPC 1.7(b), allowing a lawyer to represent a client notwithstanding the existence of a concurrent conflict of interest if the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client, the representation is not prohibited by law, the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same litigation, and each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing; RPC 3.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer in pretrial procedure from failing to make reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing party; RPC 5.3(b), requiring a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over a non-lawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the non-lawyerâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; and RPC 5.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction, or assisting another in doing so.

This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to communicate, failure to deposit advance costs into a trust account, failure to provide an accounting of client funds, and failure to refund unused costs when terminated.Ms. Nance represented Client A and his adoptive mother in a complex immigration matter. In addition to fees for anticipated legal work, Client A paid Ms. Nance $355 in February 2008, to be used as the filing fee for a petition. Ms. Nance did not deposit or maintain any of the $355 filing fee advance in a trust account. After performing substantial legal work on behalf of Client A, Ms. Nance was discharged in late October 2008. At the time of her discharge, Ms. Nance had not filed the petition or paid the filing fee. Client Aâ€™s new lawyer wrote to Ms. Nance on October 22, 2008, requesting Client Aâ€™s file and an accounting for the $355 Client A had advanced for the filing fee. Ms. Nance did not provide Client Aâ€™s file to his new lawyer until December 23, 2008. Despite a number of requests for a refund of the advanced filing fee, Ms. Nance did not refund the advanced filing fee until April 2011.In May 2008, Ms. Nance was hired by Clients B and C to represent them in pursuing immigration petitions. Clients B and C provided Ms. Nance with $2,010 of advance filing fees and costs, which Ms. Nance did not deposit or maintain in a trust account. In July 2008, Ms. Nance filed petitions with USCIS on behalf of Clients B and C, and transmitted $1,365 of filing fees to the USCIS. It was learned that the filing fees for the immigration petitions were less than had been estimated. Ms. Nance met with Client C in August 2008, at which time she indicated that the filing fees had been $645 less than estimated and that she would refund that amount less the costs that had been incurred.Ms. Nance paid Client C $400 at that meeting and promised to provide an accounting and any balance shortly thereafter. Client B left several telephone messages for Ms. Nance asking for an update; Ms. Nance considered the messages to be irate and abusive. While Ms. Nance left messages for Client B, she chose not to directly communicate with him. In October 2008, Clients B and C retained a new lawyer to represent them and requested an accounting from Ms. Nance. No accounting was provided until October 2010, when Ms. Nance provided a response to the formal complaint in her disciplinary matter. She did not refund the balance due to Clients B and C until April 2011.Ms. Nanceâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4(a)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.15A(c)(1), requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients and third persons separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property and to deposit and hold in a trust account funds subject to this Rule; RPC 1.15A(e), requiring a lawyer to promptly provide a written accounting to a client or third person after distribution of property or upon request; and RPC 1.16(d), requiring a lawyer to promptly notify a client or third person of receipt of the client or third personâ€™s property.

Prior to discovery, Mr. Sanford requested that the clientâ€™s claims adjuster send him the file on the employeeâ€™s claim. During discovery, the plaintiff requested the claims adjusterâ€™s complete file, which was produced, minus various privileged documents and a privilege log listing those documents. Some information that was relevant to the plaintiff â€™s claim was missing from the claims adjusterâ€™s file. Although Mr. Sanford made no inquiry with the claims adjuster about whether the entire file was submitted, both he and the defendant certified that the responses to the plaintiff â€™s discovery request were complete.

On July 3, 2008, the client withdrew his grievance, stating that he and Mr. Landry had resolved the misunderstanding.

The discipline is based upon his failure to adequately supervise his staff and make appropriate inquiry in a guardianship matter.Mr. Neil is the executive director of Pacific Guardianship Services (PGS), a non-profit corporation designed to administer guardianships. He also maintains a law practice that gives legal advice to PGS on some issues. On June 12, 1992, Mr. Neil, as lawyer for PGS, filed a petition for appointment of a guardian for a woman who could no longer live alone. The Court appointed a family member guardian of the person and PGS guardian of the estate. The woman died on November 28, 1993. On December 28, 1993, the Court approved PGSâ€™s final report and accounting and discharged PGS as guardian of the estate. This report indicated that the estate contained $945.58, of which $407.12 was disbursed to PGS and $539.06 to Mr. Neil. The report also indicated that additional fees were waived, due to insufficient funds in the estate. The family did not retain Mr. Neil to represent the estate after the womanâ€™s death. Over a year after PGS had been discharged, Mr. Neilâ€™s secretary requested that a bank send Mr. Neil a certificate of deposit (CD) owned by the woman. The secretaryâ€™s letter indicated that PGS was the womanâ€™s court-appointed guardian. The bank sent PGS a check for $6,453.79. Mr. Neilâ€™s office contacted DSHS and negotiated a complete release of its lien for $3,261.68, an amount less that the total owed. Mr. Neilâ€™s office also filed a small estate affidavit, but failed to give the statutorily required notices of the proceeding. The remaining $3,192.11 was paid to Mr. Neil in fees. A portion of these fees was applied to fees that Mr. Neil had earlier represented to the court he would waive, due to insufficient estate assets. The remaining fees were fees earned after PGS had been discharged as guardian. Mr. Neil was aware of these disbursements, but failed to make appropriate inquiry and provide proper staff supervision. The estate filed a civil suit against Mr. Neil and PGS. Mr. Neil paid restitution to the estate and the civil suit was settled. Mr. Neilâ€™s conduct violated RPC 5.3(c), requiring a lawyer to be responsible for the ethical conduct of his nonlawyer assistants; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.Vernon Harkins represented Mr. Neil.

This resignation was based onconduct involving conversion of clientsâ€™ funds,failure to deposit advance fees into a trust account,and failure to protect clientsâ€™ interests. While notadmitting to the misconduct in the Statement ofAlleged Misconduct, Ms. Maples admits that theBar Association could prove the violations, by aclear preponderance of the evidence, sufficient toresult in her disbarment. According to the Statementof Alleged Misconduct:Misappropriation of Client Funds: Ms.Maples was hired on a one-third contingentfee basis to represent Client A in her personalinjury claim. On March 29, 2010, Ms. Maplesreceived and deposited into her trust accounta $25,000 check representing settlementproceeds belonging to Client A. On March30, 2010, Ms. Maples paid herself $8,250 asher contingent fee, leaving $16,750 of ClientAâ€™s settlement proceeds in the trust account.Between March 30, 2010, and December 31,2010, at a time when she was experiencingfinancial problems, Ms. Maples knowinglymisappropriated client funds held in her trustaccount, most of which belonged to Client A.During November and December 2010, ClientA and her husband contacted Ms. Maplesand asked for her settlement proceeds. OnDecember 15, 2010, Ms. Maples paid Client A$1,000. At that time, Ms. Maplesâ€™s trust accountcontained $10,290.31, when it should havecontained $15,020.39 of Client Aâ€™s settlementproceeds. On September 23, 2011, Ms. Mapleswithdrew $10,000 from her trust account andused these funds to issue a certified check to2012Client A for $10,000, leaving an outstandingbalance owed to Client A of $5,020.59.Mishandling of Advance Fees: From 2009until September 2011, Ms. Maples requiredclients who hired her on an hourly basis topay a â€œretainer.â€ As described in her standardfee agreement, the â€œretainersâ€ were actuallyadvance fees that should have been depositedinto a trust account.

Ms. Maplesoften did not have sufficient funds available topromptly return unearned advance fees. Clientsroutinely would have to wait many monthsbefore Ms. Maples returned unearned advancefees. For example, two clients hired Ms. Maplesto represent them in their individual family lawmatters. The clients paid Ms. Maples $2,000and $2,500 respectively, which Ms. Maplesdeposited into her general account and usedfor personal purposes. One client terminatedMs. Maples for not pursuing her matter, whilethe other terminated Ms. Maples shortly afterhiring her. Both clients repeatedly asked Ms.Maples to return their unearned advance fees.Ms. Maples returned the first clientâ€™s advancefees only after the client had filed a grievancewith the Bar Association. Ms. Maples returnedthe second clientâ€™s unearned fees seven monthsafter the client hired her.Trust Account Withdrawals.

1641.html,22092,Kaaren Barr,,Disbarment,3/9/2012,,"Kaaren L. Barr (WSBA No. 22092, admitted 1992), of Emmett, Idaho,  was disbarred, effective March 9, 2012, by order of the WashingtonState Supreme Court. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to provide competent representation, failure to communicate, conduct prejudicial to the administration ofjustice, and willfully disobeying a court order. Ms. Barr was a sole practitioner who concentratedher practice on immigration law. In 2005 and 2006, Ms. Barr was sanctioned by the Ninth Circuit in five immigration matters. InOctober 2008, the Ninth Circuit issued an Order to Show Cause to Ms. Barr to show why she should not be sanctioned for â€œrepeated violations of this courtâ€™s rules and orders and the rules of professional conduct, and for conduct unbecoming a member of this courtâ€™s bar in many of the 236 casesâ€ in which Ms. Barr hadappeared before that court. Ms. Barrâ€™s violations included:â€¢ Filing briefs with the Ninth Circuit thatconsisted of boilerplate language, with verylittle application of law to fact;â€¢ Filing briefs that demonstrated failure tomonitor changing case law, included argumentspreviously rejected by the Ninth Circuit,and waived her clientsâ€™ asylum claimsbecause they did not address certain issues;â€¢ Filing briefs that compromised her clientsâ€™chances of prevailing before the NinthCircuit; andâ€¢ Failing to file timely appeals in the NinthCircuit on behalf of clients or to exhaustissues before the Board of ImmigrationAppeals (BIA).At a hearing in the Ninth Circuit on February 17, 2009, Ms. Barr admitted to all of the allegations in the Order to Show Cause and proposed that she resign from practice rather than have the Ninth Circuit suspend her for her actions. The Ninth Circuit report recommended that Ms. Barr be allowed to resign on condition that she also withdraw from all cases pending before the BIA within 30 days, provide clients in pending cases with the clerk of the courtâ€™s address, and advise clients of her intent to resignand have the clients notify the court immediately in writing if they wished to retain new counsel or to represent themselves on appeal. On May 12, 2009, the Ninth Circuit adopted the report and recommendation and ordered that Ms. Barr was no longer eligible to practice before the Ninth Circuit or BIA. Contrary to the Courtâ€™s order, Ms. Barr did not review her files to determine how many of her clients had cases pending before the BIA. Instead, asclientsâ€™ briefs came due, Ms. Barr withdrew or gave them advice about how to proceed. Ms. Barr was retained by Client X in 2003 to represent him in immigration proceedings. Client X paid Ms. Barr $1,500 to file an asylum claim on his behalf. On September 2, 2003,Client X attended his individual hearing in Immigration Court. Ms. Barr spent approximately half an hour preparing Client X for thishearing, which was inadequate preparation. The immigration judge dismissed Client Xâ€™s asylum claim. Ms. Barr told Client X that shewould appeal his case; however, Client X was unable to contact Ms. Barr to discuss his case, did not meet with Ms. Barr between 2003 and 2009, and never received any copies of briefs she filed on his behalf. In July 2004, Ms. Barr filed a brief with the BIA to appeal the immigration judgeâ€™s decision after the scheduled deadline, along with a motion to allow late filing. In the motion, Ms. Barr stated that she had â€œfailed to calendar the briefing schedule.â€ In a declaration, Ms. Barr wrote that she had discussedthe appeal with Client X and advised him that she would be filing a brief on his behalf. Client X denies that he knew about the brief or knew that Ms. Barr had failed to timely file it. The BIA refused to accept the late filing and dismissed Client Xâ€™s matter in August 2004. Ms. Barr did not inform Client X of the dismissal. In September 2004, without discussing this decision with the client, Ms. Barr filed a Petition for Review of the BIAâ€™s August 2004 decision with the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit dismissedthe petition and remanded the case back to the BIA, allowing Client X another â€œbite at the apple.â€ Ms. Barr did not inform Client X that the case was again pending in front of the BIA or review his case with him. She filed a â€œboilerplateâ€ brief with the BIA in July 2008, which was nearly identical to the 2004 brief she had previously filed on Client Xâ€™s behalf. Neither the facts nor the law in the brief had been updated to reflect current conditions. As of the Ninth Circuitâ€™s May 12, 2009, order,Client Xâ€™s case was still pending before the BIA. Ms. Barr did not notify Client X that she could no longer represent him, which violated the Ninth Circuitâ€™s Order. The BIA again dismissed Client Xâ€™s appeal. The deadline to appeal this decision was 30 days. Client X received a copy of this decision in the mail but did not understand what it meant and was unable to contact Ms. Barr by phone. Instead of contacting Client X directly, whose contact information had not changed, Ms. Barr sent Client Xâ€™s friend anemail asking him to tell Client X to contact her. Ms. Barr met with Client X in December 2009 and, for the first time, told Client X that she was no longer allowed to practice in theNinth Circuit or the BIA and that he should hire a new lawyer to appeal the BIAâ€™s decision. Ms. Barr failed to timely inform Client X of the proceedings against her before the Ninth Circuit, which was a condition of her being permitted to resign. Client X did not file a timely appeal of the BIAâ€™s November 2009 decision and, as a result, was arrested and spent 39 days in detention. Ms. Barr did not tell Client X that he was at risk of being taken into custody. While in detention, Client Xâ€™s wife retained lawyers who assistedhim in getting out of detention and reopened Client Xâ€™s case based upon changed conditions in Client Xâ€™s country of origin and ineffective assistance by Ms. Barr. Client X had an individualhearing in Immigration Court. The judge denied his application for asylum and withholding of removal and ordered him to depart the country. Ms. Barrâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiringa lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptnessin representing a client; RPC 1.4(a)(1), requiring a lawyer to promptly inform the client of any decision of circumstance with respect to which the clientâ€™s informed consent is required bythese Rules; RPC 1.4(a)(3), requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter; RPC 1.4(a)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; andRPC 8.4(j), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order directing him or her to do or cease doing an act which he or she ought in good faith to do or forbear.Erica W.

There were only a fewissues remaining, one of which was that partieshad not agreed on the support order. On November9, 2009, Mr. Dunlap electronically filed a notice ofsettlement. He believed that parties had resolvedall the issues, but the opposing party had notsigned the support order and never did so. Mr.Dunlap failed to advise the court, or Client A, thatthe support issue was unresolved. On March 3,2010, the court dismissed the matter because 90days had elapsed since the notice of settlementand neither party had advised the court that issuesremained unresolved. Mr. Dunlap knew thecourt had dismissed the matter, but did nothing tovacate the dismissal and did not tell Client A thather case had been dismissed. Mr. Dunlap did nottell Client A that he was unable to attend to hermatter for personal reasons and failed to respondto her repeated phone calls.On July 27, 2010, Client A filed a grievance withthe Bar Association based on Mr. Dunlapâ€™s failureto attend to her case. The Bar Association sent Mr.Dunlap two letters requesting his response to thegrievance, which he received, but he did not respondto the grievance. The Bar Association servedMr. Dunlap with a subpoena commanding him toappear for a deposition regarding Client Aâ€™s grievanceand to bring certain client files. Mr. Dunlapappeared for the deposition and brought the file.Matter 2: In May 2009, Client B hired Mr.Dunlap to represent him in a dissolution actionfiled by Client Bâ€™s wife. The matter proceededuneventfully. In February 2010, parties stipulatedto continue the trial date until August 2010. ClientB spoke to Mr. Dunlap in May 2010, at which timeMr. Dunlap told him that they should know morein August 2010. Client B heard nothing more fromMr. Dunlap until he filed a grievance, which wasafter the date for trial had passed. The court helda pretrial conference on July 1, 2010. Mr. Dunlapdid not appear. The petitionerâ€™s counsel appearedat the conference and advised the court that theparties were attempting to reconcile. On July 10,2010, the petitionerâ€™s counsel moved to dismisson grounds that the parties had reconciled. Mr.Dunlap did not file a response. The court dismissedthe case on July 20, 2010. Mr. Dunlap did not adviseClient B that the case was dismissed. Client B andhis wife did not reconcile, and Client B wantedto pursue dissolution. Client B tried to reach Mr.Dunlap to discuss his case but Mr. Dunlap did notreturn his calls. Client B ultimately had to hire newcounsel and begin the dissolution process anew.Mr. Dunlapâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiringa lawyer to act with reasonable diligence andpromptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4,requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonablyinformed about the status of the matter andpromptly comply with reasonable requests forinformation; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyerfrom violating a duty or sanction imposed byor under the Rules for Enforcement of LawyerConduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Joanne S.

1648.html,9142,Peter Nansen,,Reprimand,3/19/2012,,"Peter Dirk Nansen (WSBA No. 9142, admitted 1979), of Bellingham, was ordered to receive two reprimands following approval of a stipulation by a hearing officer on March 19, 2012. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to communicate, trust account irregularities, communicating directly with a represented person about a matter, and implying disinterest when dealing with an unrepresented person. Matter No. 1: Mr. Nansen filed a petition on behalf of Client A seeking guardianship over her boyfriend, Mr. J. Eight days later, Mr. Nansen met with Mr. J and told him that he was representing his estate and trying to help him. Mr. Nansen obtained Mr. Jâ€™s signature on documents establishing an irrevocable trust naming Client A as trustee, and transferring property into the trust. Mr. J reasonably believed that Mr. Nansen was representing his interests or that he was, atleast, disinterested. Mr. Nansen knew that the interests of Client A and Mr. J had the possibility of conflicting, but did not adequately clarify his role. The court appointed a lawyer to represent Mr. J in the guardianship proceeding. While Mr. J was represented, Mr. Nansen met twice and spoke nine times with Mr. J by telephone without obtaining authorization from his counsel tocommunicate directly to him. Matter No. 2: Mr. Nansen entered into a written fee agreement with Client B that provided for a $2,500 â€œnon-refundable fee,â€ but did not meet the requirements of RPC 1.5( f). Mr. Nansen received $15,637 of Client Bâ€™s funds, but did not directly deposit any of the funds into a trust account even though he had not yet earned the fees. He deposited $2,500 into his general account and deposited $13,095 into a subaccount within his general account. Mr. Nansen then subsequently disbursed $10,300 to himself for attorneyâ€™s fees without providing Client B with written notice of his intent to do so. At the end of his representation of Client B, Mr. Nansen provided Client B with an â€œaccountingâ€ that did not completely or accurately reflect all the transactions related to Client Bâ€™s funds. Mr. Nansenâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4(a) and (b), requiring a lawyer to keep the clientreasonably informed about the status of a matter and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(f)(2), allowing a lawyer to charge a flat fee for a specified service and not deposit it into a trust account if agreed to in advance in a writing signed by the client; RPC 1.15A(c)(1), requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients and third persons separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property and to deposit and hold in a trust account funds subject to this Rule; RPC 1.15A(c)(2), requiring a lawyer to deposit into a trust account legal feesand expenses that have been paid in advance, to be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned or expenses incurred; RPC 1.15A(e), requiring a lawyer to promptly provide a written accounting to a client or third person after distribution of property or upon request; RPC 1.15A(h)(3), requiring a lawyer to give reasonablewritten notice to a client before withdrawing earned fees from the clientâ€™s funds; RPC 4.2, prohibiting a lawyer from communicating about the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized todo so by law; and RPC 4.3, prohibiting a lawyer, in dealing with a person who is not represented by counsel, from stating or implying that the lawyer is disinterested.

Cassidy (WSBA No. 11246, admitted 1980), of Lynnwood, was ordered to receive a reprimand following approval of a stipulation by the chief hearing officer on April 6, 2012. This discipline was based on conduct involving dishonesty. On February 18, 2011, Mr. Cassidy, an employee of a community college, was deposed by counsel for a staff member appealing her termination from the college. During the deposition, Mr. Cassidy intentionally gave false testimony, under oath, about a matter of marginal relevance. Mr. Cassidy testified falsely by denying his ownership of a Facebook account, claiming a fictitious person owned the site, and that the fictitious person, not Mr. Cassidy, made a posting to another Facebook page. After counsel for the staff member continued Mr. Cassidyâ€™s deposition to allow him to provide contact information for the owner of the site, Mr. Cassidy confessed tohis lawyer that he had not told the truth, and his lawyer contacted the staff memberâ€™s lawyer and told him Mr. Cassidyâ€™s statements were false.When the deposition continued, Mr. Cassidy fully retracted his false statements, admitted that he was the owner of the Facebook site, andtestified that he had made the posting.

1652.html,38059,Keenan Powell,,Suspension,5/4/2012,,"Keenan Powell (WSBA No. 38059, admitted 2006), of Anchorage, Alaska, was suspended for six months, effective May 4, 2012, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court imposing reciprocal discipline in accordance with an order of the Alaska Supreme Court. Ms. Powell will serve 90 days of the suspension and have 90 days of the suspension stayed pending successful completion of a two-year probation period that will start when she returns to practice after serving the 90-day suspension. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to supervise a non-lawyer assistant and fee sharing. In late 2007, Ms. Powell discovered that a contract employee, Ms. M, had embezzled inexcess of $7,000 from her law firmâ€™s petty cash account. Ms. Powell filed a report with the Anchorage Police Department. Second-degree theft and second-degree forgery charges were filed against Ms. M as a result of the alleged embezzlement; a warrant was issued in April 2008, but was later dismissed in July 2008. In May 2008, Ms. M filed a complaint with the Alaska Bar Association against Ms. Powell. The investigation found that Ms. Powell had a reasonable basis to report her suspicions. It also revealed that Ms. Powell hired Ms. M in the late 1990s as a contract employee. Ms. M worked the hours she chose, provided her own office space, and paid the salaries of persons who occasionally worked for her. Ms. Powell provided letterhead and paid for copier and postage costs. Ms. M never submitted timesheets and Ms. Powell never paid Ms. M a separate salary; rather Ms. Powell generally paid Ms. M at the conclusion of a case from profits. The percentage of profits assigned to Ms. M varied on a file-by-file basis. Ms. Powell would discuss with Ms. M her decision about how much to pay on a particular case. It was an informal arrangement that took into account the financial needs of running the office and paying case costs as the first priority. In 2007, Ms. Powell discovered that Ms. M was working for another attorney. In October 2007, Ms. Powell fired Ms. M because of a pattern of neglecting clients and files, lying to cover up poor performance, and extending unauthorized settlement offers. Ms. Powell discovered the alleged embezzlement from her petty cash account approximately one week later. Ms. Powellâ€™s conduct violated Alaskaâ€™s RPC 5.3(a)(2), requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that her non-lawyer employeeâ€™s conduct was compatible with the professional obligations of a lawyer; Alaskaâ€™s RPC 5.4, prohibiting a lawyer from sharing legal fees with a non-lawyer except in limited exceptions; Alaskaâ€™s RPC 5.4(a)(3), prohibiting a lawyer from including a non-lawyer in a compensation or retirement plan based in whole or in part on a profit-sharing arrangement if the non-lawyer is not an employee; and Alaskaâ€™s RPC 5.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from forming a partnership with a non-lawyer if any of the activities in the partnership consist of the practice of law.

1655.html,21440,Thomas Alexiou,,Reprimand,4/10/2012,,"Thomas J. Alexiou (WSBA No. 21440, admitted 1992), of Edmonds, was ordered to receive two reprimands following approval of a stipulation by the Chief Hearing Officer on April 10, 2012. This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to act with reasonable diligence, failure to communicate, charging unreasonable fees, and failure to expedite litigation.	In June 2008, Client A hired Mr. Alexiou to draft documents and obtain an uncontested divorce. Although the petition and summons that Mr. Alexiou drafted were signed by both parties in August 2008, Mr. Alexiou failed to file them until August 2009. Three months after the documents were filed, Client Aâ€™s wife was told by the court that the divorce was not final because Mr. Alexiou had not filed all of the necessary documents. Client A and his wife called and sent letters to Mr. Alexiou during the next year, but he generally did not return their calls, answer their letters, or provide them with documents or the status of their matter. When Mr. Alexiou did speak to them, he made excuses for failing to obtain the divorce.  When Client A and his wife were still not divorced by December 2010, Client Aâ€™s wife filed a grievance with the Bar Association. After Mr. Alexiou completed and filed the complete dissolution documents with the court, it granted the divorce on June 28, 2011.	In November 2010, Client Bâ€™s grandmother paid Mr. Alexiou $5,000 to represent her grandson, who was incarcerated on criminal charges. Mr. Alexiou agreed to take the matter to conclusion (whether by plea or by trial), entered his appearance in the matter, and was granted a trial continuance. After failing to contact Client B by January 24, 2011, Client Bâ€™s father called Mr. Alexiou, who told him that he had negotiated a plea that would be entered on January 28, 2011. Mr. Alexiou told Clientâ€™s father that he would contact him when the plea was entered. Mr. Alexiou did not appear for the scheduled plea entry or for two rescheduled plea entry dates, did not contact Client B or his father, and did not return phone calls. In February 2011, Client Bâ€™s grandmother sent Mr. Alexiou a certified letter requesting the return of the $5,000 fee. In April 2011, a Superior Court judge removed Mr. Alexiou from the case and appointed a public defender to represent Client B to enter his plea. In December 2011, Mr. Alexiou refunded $2,500 of the fee paid by Client Bâ€™s grandmother.	 In October 2009, Client C paid Mr. Alexiou $2,500 to modify a parenting plan to obtain custody of his fifteen-year old daughter. Mr. Alexiou told Client C that the hearing would be scheduled by Thanksgiving 2009. Mr. Alexiou did not prepare a parenting plan or provide legal services in the matter, return Client Câ€™s phone calls, or inform him of the status of the case between November 2009 and May 2011. In December 2011, Mr. Alexiou refunded Client Câ€™s entire fee.	  In August 2009, Client D paid Mr. Alexiou $1,000 to obtain a divorce from his wife, who had been estranged from Client D for over 20 years. Between September 2009 and April 2011, Client D called and sent letters and emails to Mr. Alexiou, who generally did not respond or provide Client D with documents or the status of his matter. On two separate occasions, Mr. Alexiou requested that Client D send him copies of Client Dâ€™s file because Mr. Alexiou had misplaced it. Mr. Alexiou did not prepare or file the divorce documents or provide legal services in the matter, although he did have contact on one occasion with a private investigator and process server who could not locate Client Dâ€™s wife. In December 2011, Mr. Alexiou refunded Client Dâ€™s entire fee.	Mr. Alexiouâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information;  RPC 1.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses; and RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client.

1662.html,27789,Ruth Westbrook,,Disbarment,6/19/2012,,"Ruth Ann Elizabeth Westbrook, (WSBA No. 27789, admitted 1998), of Everett, was disbarred, effective June 19, 2012, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court. This discipline was based on conduct involving the crime of theft, failure to safeguard client property, and dishonest conduct.At all relevant times, Ms. Westbrook was an equal shareholder in the Firm and was in charge of managing the Firmâ€™s finances; her duties included managing the Firmâ€™s bank accounts, handling the Firmâ€™s cash, paying employee salaries, and paying the Firmâ€™s financial obligations, including taxes. Ms. Westbrook usually controlled the Firmâ€™s check books. On May 17, 2006, the Firm was hired to represent Client A in a marital dissolution. On or about October 16, 2006, the Firm received a check in the amount of $141,679.03 representing the proceeds from the sale of Client Aâ€™s family residence. The Partner handling Client Aâ€™s case directed Ms. Westbrook to deposit the proceeds in the Firmâ€™s IOLTA account pending the courtâ€™s determination on how the proceeds would be distributed. At the time the Firm received the proceeds, Client A did not owe the Firm any attorney fees and had a credit balance, and Ms. Westbrook had no reason to believe that any of the proceeds belonged to the Firm. On October 16, 2006, Ms. Westbrook deposited the $141,679.03 into the Firmâ€™s operating account. The next day Ms. Westbrook transferred $110,679.03 of the $141,679.03 in proceeds from the Firmâ€™s operating account into the Firmâ€™s IOLTA account. Ms. Westbrook intentionally left $31,000 of the proceeds in the Firmâ€™s operating account because she was concerned about whether the Firm could timely pay her salary and/or bonus. Ms. Westbrook delayed paying the payroll until $31,000 of the proceeds was deposited into the Firmâ€™s operating account. Ms. Westbrookâ€™s partners were not aware of her concern regarding the Firmâ€™s cash flow. Ms. Westbrook used Client Aâ€™s proceeds to pay her salary, bonus and other Firm expenses. On November 1, 2006 Ms. Westbrook transferred $10,000 from the Firmâ€™s operating account into the Firmâ€™s IOLTA account, which was intended to represent a portion of the $31,000 in Client Aâ€™s proceeds that was returned. On March 24, 2007, Ms. Westbrook transferred $20,000 from the Firmâ€™s operating account to its IOLTA account intended to represent the remaining portion of Client Aâ€™s proceeds, leaving $1,000 unaccounted for. Ms. Westbrook knowingly concealed the misappropriation of the proceeds from Client A and the Firm and prepared a client account ledger for Client A that intentionally misrepresented that the proceeds were deposited into the Firmâ€™s IOLTA account. The ledger did not describe any of the transfers from the Firmâ€™s operating account to the Firmâ€™s IOLTA account as described above. At the time of these events, Ms. Westbrook owed back taxes to the IRS. On January 31, 2007, the Firm received an Order of Withholding to withhold Ms. Westbrookâ€™s earnings to pay an outstanding student loan obligation of $41,067.55.	During the period from January 17, 2007 to April 17, 2007, Ms. Westbrook did not deposit any of the $6,300 in cash that was received by the Firm into the Firmâ€™s operating account or other bank accounts. Ms. Westbrook concealed her conversion of the cash by preparing a list of retainers and payments received by the Firm to falsely represent that certain cash payments were deposited into the Firmâ€™s operating account on certain dates. On April 4, 2007, Ms. Westbrook issued a check for $800 to her then husband to pay her share of household finances. The check stub falsely reflected that the check was an â€œearly drawâ€ issued to Ms. Westbrook. In fact, the $800 check was not an early draw and Ms. Westbrook did not deduct the $800 from any future salary or bonus check. The Firm had no knowledge of and had not given authority for the $800 check. From February 2007 through April 15, 2007, the Firmâ€™s Partners received a bonus based on 60 percent of the income generated by each lawyer; the remaining 40 percent belonged to the Firm. Ms. Westbrookâ€™s handwritten records reflect that she generated $5,750 of income for the Firm from February 2007 through March 31, 2007. Based on the 60% bonus formula, Ms. Westbrook was entitled to a bonus of $3,450. Ms. Westbrook issued a bonus check to herself for the amount of $5,750. Ms. Westbrook intentionally converted $2,300 from the Firm causing injury to the Firm. 	Unbeknownst to the Firm, during 2006, Ms. Westbrook failed to pay the Firmâ€™s 941 payroll taxes. On April 16, 2007, an IRS agent made a field call to the Firm to investigate this matter. On May 15, 2007, Ms. Westbrook resigned from the Firm.	During Ms. Westbrookâ€™s deposition on December 13, 2010, she falsely testified that she was directed to place Client Aâ€™s proceeds in the Firmâ€™s operating account, that she did not transfer funds in November 2007, and that there was â€œneverâ€ a time Ms. Westbrook decided to pay herself 100 percent of the bonus money. Ms. Westbrookâ€™s testimony was made with the intent to benefit her by concealing her ethical misconduct. 	Ms. Westbrookâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.15A(b), prohibiting a lawyer from converting, borrowing or pledging client or third person property for the lawyerâ€™s own use; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.

This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to safeguard property, failure to act with reasonable diligence, failure to communicate, charging unreasonable fees, and failure to promptly return unearned fees upon termination of representation.Between 2010 and 2011, Mr. Morrison:â€¢	Failed to comply with the trust account rules by not depositing advance fees into his trust account, and using the funds before the fees were earned;  â€¢	Failed to notify clients that he was unavailable while on vacation. This impacted several clients with time sensitive matters who did not know why they were unable to contact Mr. Morrison;â€¢	Failed to have a written agreement with Client A and did not diligently or promptly pursue Client Aâ€™s child support modification petition, which resulted in Client A being obligated to pay additional child support;â€¢	Failed to complete Client Bâ€™s marital dissolution and name change. Mr. Morrison received $1,750 in advance fees but did not keep track of his time and did not send Client B any billing statements. Mr. Morrison eventually provided sufficient services to earn the $1,750 but insisted that Client B pay him an additional $1,000 immediately for completing the dissolution and preparing Qualified Domestic Relations Orders (QDROs) or he would withdraw as her counsel. Client B paid Mr. Morrison the $1,000 he demanded, but Mr. Morrison did not prepare and file the QDROs and did not take any steps to change Client Bâ€™s name. Mr. Morrison agreed to return the $1,000 as part of the stipulated resolution of this discipline matter; â€¢	Failed to inform Client C of his child support hearing order. The Order stated that Client C was in contempt for not paying child support as ordered and was to be imprisoned for four days, and that the confinement would be suspended provided that Client C paid the child support owed. A follow-up hearing was scheduled for May 3, 2011, but Mr. Morrison never informed Client C; Client C did not know about or attend the hearing and Mr. Morrison failed to attend on behalf of Client C. That same day, the court issued an Order for a bench warrant for Client Câ€™s arrest and ordered additional sanctions of $500. Several weeks later, the family residence was sold and Client Câ€™s support obligations were satisfied from his share of the proceeds of the sale; the bench warrant was quashed before Client C was arrested; â€¢	Failed to provide Client D with copies of her Decree of Dissolution and Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which in turn delayed Client Dâ€™s receipt of funds from her ex-husbandâ€™s retirement account. When Client D did eventually receive her interest in the retirement account funds, the amount paid reflected a reduction for an early withdrawal penalty and taxes;â€¢	Failed to communicate with Client E from June 2011 through January 2012. Mr. Morrison did not return Client Eâ€™s telephone messages and did not respond to his emails. Mr. Morrison prepared a Petition for Dissolution for Client E; Client E and his spouse both signed the petition but Mr. Morrison never filed it with the court. On November 1, 2011, Mr. Morrison sent an email to Client E stating he would be â€œsending final documents to you next weekâ€ for Client Eâ€™s signature; however, this statement was inaccurate due to Mr. Morrisonâ€™s failure to file the petition or commence the proceedings. Client E did not receive the â€œfinal documentsâ€;  â€¢	Failed to charge reasonable fees to Client F. Mr. Morrison agreed to charge Client F at an hourly rate of $200 and to charge paralegal time at an hourly rate of $75. Client F paid Mr. Morrison advance fees of $2,500. On August 8, 2011, Mr. Morrison paid himself $600 from Client Fâ€™s $2,500 advance fees and did not send Client F a billing statement or notify Client F that he was paying himself $600. Between August 31, 2011 and September 6, 2011, Mr. Morrison drafted a proposed parenting plan and filed a Petition for Modification; on October 17, 2011, Mr. Morrison paid himself $1,516 from the advanced fees. On December 5, 2011, Client F received the first and only billing statement from Mr. Morrison which reflected that he charged $900 (4.5 hours of Mr. Morrisonâ€™s time) for preparing the summons and the petition. Mr. Morrison stipulated that preparing the summons and petition took 1.5 hours; â€¢	Failed to promptly file a petition to modify child support for Client G. On October 3, 2011, Mr. Morrison was hired by Client G to file a petition for modification of child support but Mr. Morrison did not complete the documents and never filed the petition. Client G contacted Mr. Morrison on numerous occasions via email but did not receive a respond. On November 28, 2011, Client G sent an email to Mr. Morrison terminating him because the delay in filing the petition made the matter moot; Mr. Morrison returned unearned fees to his clients as a condition of the stipulation in this discipline matter.Mr. Morrisonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to communicate with the client; RPC 1.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses; RPC 1.15A(c), requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients and third persons separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property; RPC 1.16(d), requiring a lawyer, upon termination of representation, to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred; and RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interest of the client.

Pimentel, (WSBA No. 23564, admitted 1994), of Poulsbo, was ordered to receive a reprimand following approval of a stipulation by the Chief Hearing Officer on August 8, 2008. This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to communicate with client, failure to act promptly and diligently to represent his client, failure to secure a promissory note, and failure to refund unearned fees.	On July 6, 2006, Mr. Pimentel was hired to represent Client A on misdemeanor criminal charges. Client Aâ€™s grandmother (â€œGrandmotherâ€) paid Mr. Pimentel a $4,000 flat, non-refundable fee. Client Aâ€™s first hearing was scheduled for August 9, 2006, but per Mr. Pimentelâ€™s request â€œto better prepare,â€ the hearing was continued to August 30, 2006. Mr. Pimentel failed to appear for the August 30, 2006 hearing. After calling Mr. Pimentelâ€™s office, the court rescheduled the hearing to September 6, 2006. At the September 6, 2006, hearing, Mr. Pimentel requested and obtained another continuance. The hearing was continued to October 25, 2006, but Mr. Pimentel failed to appear. The judge appointed another lawyer to represent Client A and the matter was settled that morning. 	Mr. Pimentelâ€™s client files reflects that he did little, if any, work on Client Aâ€™s case.

Mr. Pimentel did not sign the deed of trust. After making his June and July payments, Mr. Pimentel defaulted on the note when he failed to make his scheduled August payment.  On August 21, 2007, Grandmother sent a letter to Mr. Pimentel stating that he had not made his August payment and the deed of trust had not been returned. Grandmother also informed the Association. Mr. Pimentel did not respond until December 7, 2007, when he sent a check in the amount of $350 to Grandmother. In early 2008, Mr. Pimentel repaid the entire amount due to Grandmother.

Mr. Himberger failed to keep complete records of his trust account funds and to preserve those records for a period of five years after termination of representation. Mr. Himberger explained that some computer records relating to the trust account were lost or destroyed by a former employee. Mr. Himberger acknowledged he was not able to conclusively determine or allocate funds held in his trust from January 2010 until very recently, when he hired a CPA to identify the ownership of funds presently held in the trust account and to recommend internal accounting controls. Mr. Himberger acknowledged a lack of records demonstrating that his trust account funds were held totally separate from his own property; however, none of Mr. Himbergerâ€™s clients made any complaints to the Idaho State Bar regarding his handling of their trust account funds, and his clients did not request any accountings of their funds held in his trust account.

This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to act with due diligence, failure to communicate, and failure to safeguard property. 	Matter 1: In 2007, Client A hired Mr. Allen to probate and assist with his fatherâ€™s estate. On or about October 15, 2008, Mr. Allen gave Client A an invoice showing that Client A owed Mr. Allen $1,219. That same day, Client A gave Mr. Allen a $2,000 check. Mr. Allen deposited these funds into his general business account, but at the time, Mr. Allen had not yet earned at least $781 of the funds. On October 22, 2008, Mr. Allen obtained Letters Testamentary to give Client A authority to act as personal representative. Client A accessed a safety deposit box which held annuity policies and letters showing that Client Aâ€™s father owned stock in various companies. Client A gave these documents and other documents to Mr. Allen for safekeeping. From October 2008 through May 2011, Mr. Allen failed to appropriately safeguard the original documents and refused to respond to Client Aâ€™s multiple requests for their return. Mr. Allen took no further action to complete the probate proceedings. Over the next two years, Client A made multiple attempts to contact Mr. Allen in order to gain information about his case, but Mr. Allen did not respond. In July 2010, Client A filed a grievance against Mr. Allen with the Association. Mr. Allen did not respond. In September 2010, the Association issued a subpoena duces tecum requiring Mr. Allen to appear for a non-cooperation deposition and to produce his file for Client Aâ€™s probate. Mr. Allen provided his files but did not produce Client Aâ€™s original documents, stating he could not find them. In January 2011, the Association wrote to Mr. Allen requesting that he inform the Association of the search he had conducted for the documents. Mr. Allen did not respond. The Association issued a second subpoena duces tecum requiring Mr. Allen to appear and produce all original documents received from Client A. In July 2011, Mr. Allen informed the Association that he had found the documents in a tote bag in his house. Mr. Allen produced the documents to the Association at his subsequent deposition. Matter 2: In 2009, Client B. hired Mr. Allen to probate and assist with his fatherâ€™s estate. Client B paid Mr. Allen $1,500 in advanced fees. Mr. Allen deposited this money into his general account prior to earning any fees. On July 9, 2009, the Will was admitted to probate and Client B was appointed as personal representative. After July 2009, Client B made repeated attempts to contact Mr. Allen to gain information about the probate but Mr. Allen had no further communication with Client B and did nothing further to advance the probate. In May 2010, Client B hired another lawyer to complete the administration of the estate, who wrote to Mr. Allen and asked him to sign a Substitution of Counsel; Mr. Allen did not respond. The lawyer filed a grievance against Mr. Allen. Mr. Allen did not respond, requiring the Association to set a non-cooperation deposition. The lawyer made a motion to remove Mr. Allen as attorney of the record in the probate proceedings. Mr. Allen filed a Notice of Substitution of Counsel the day before the scheduled hearing but failed to deliver his client file to the new lawyer until August 2010, despite repeated requests.

1688.html,13111,Sam Eck,,Reprimand,9/19/2012,,"Sam K. Eck, (WSBA No. 13111, admitted 1983), of Bellevue, was ordered to receive two (2) reprimands following approval of a stipulation by the Disciplinary Board on September 19, 2012. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to prevent conflicts of interest and sharing legal fees with a nonlawyer.	Mr. Eck is a solo practitioner whose practice emphasizes estate planning. From 1992-2012, Mr. Eck has been associated with EP, a company that markets estate planning packages. From 2007 through 2010, Mr. Eck was also associated with PG, which also marketed estate planning packages in Washington. Mr. Eck obtained several thousand clients through EP and 60 clients through PG, respectively. EP and PG use or used salespersons to sell the estate planning packages to clients in the clientsâ€™ homes. The salespersons would recommend that clients purchase the â€œliving trustâ€ package offered by the companies, so as to avoid probate. During these visits, the salespersons would collect data from the clients regarding their financial assets and their plans for disposing of the assets after death, which they entered into an estate planning â€œworkbookâ€. During the home visits, the salespersons presented clients with Mr. Eckâ€™s â€œretainer agreementâ€ for legal services (â€œagreementâ€) and had the clients sign the agreement. The agreement stated the client was hiring Mr. Eck for representation â€œin the preparation of my Revocable Living Trust and accompanying documents.â€ Mr. Eck would receive a summary of the â€œworkbookâ€ and contact the clients by telephone. In some cases, the clients would meet with Mr. Eck in his office. Mr. Eck would then prepare the trust documents, based on the workbook and his conversations with the clients. In his communications with his clients, Mr. Eck operated on the assumption that the clients wanted to purchase a living trust-based estate plan rather than a will-based estate plan, and did not always advise his clients whether other estate planning options, such as a traditional will, would be more appropriate and/or economical for them. The cost of the PG living trust-based estate plan was approximately $2,200, while the cost of the will-based estate plan was approximately $700. Mr. Eck did not disclose to his clients that he had a continuing business relationship with the living trust company whereby the living trust company would obtain clients for him, and did not disclose that his own interest in maintaining his business relationship with the living trust company could affect his independent judgment in advising his clients as to their estate planning options. Mr. Eck did not obtain informed consent, confirmed in writing, to his conflicts of interest. 	In 2007, Mr. Eck established a financial planning company M&E with a financial planner and investment advisor. Mr. Eck and the financial planner each owned a fifty percent share in M&E. Client A was an estate planning client Mr. Eck obtained through his association with PG. When Mr. Eck contacted Client A regarding the purchase of a living trust, Client A mentioned that he was not happy with his financial advisor. Mr. Eck referred him to M&E. Client A hired M&E as his financial advisor. Mr. Eck failed to disclose to Client A in writing that he had a financial interest in M&E, did not advise Client A in writing of the desirability of seeking independent counsel before hiring M&E,  and did not obtain Client Aâ€™s informed consent when Mr. Eck referred him to M&E. 	The vast majority of the clients Mr. Eck obtained through PG purchased living trust-based estate plans priced at $2,195. Clients paid the fee by check made out to Mr. Eck. The PG salesperson would collect the check from the client and give it to Mr. Eck, who would cash the check and pay PG a set fee of $1,495 for its services. On October 14, 2008, Client B executed living trust documents at her home in the presence of a PG salesperson and paid the $2,195. In 2009, Client B wrote to Mr. Eck saying she no longer needed the trust, and requested a full refund. Client B informed Mr. Eck that she had talked to the Washington State Attorney Generalâ€™s office regarding its investigation of PG. Mr. Eck wrote to Client B stating that because she signed the retainer agreement and executed the trust documents, she was not eligible for a refund. 	On July 22, 2010, PG entered into a consent decree with the Attorney Generalâ€™s office to settle charges of deceptive marketing claims. PG did not admit any wrongdoing. The settlement required PG to establish a restitution fund for consumers who purchased living trusts from the company. Client B applied for and received restitution from PG in the amount of $788, under a pro-rata system of restitution established by the Attorney General. On June 22, 2012, Mr. Eck refunded Client B $1,407, which represents the balance of the $2,195 she paid for the living trust. 	Mr. Eckâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.7(a)(2), prohibiting a lawyer from representing one or more clients when there is a significant risk the representation will be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer; RPC 1.7(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to receive informed consent to conflicts of interest, confirmed in writing by each affected client; RPC 1.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer from entering into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquiring an ownership, possessory, security or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client; and RPC 5.4, prohibiting a lawyer from sharing legal fees with a nonlawyer.

Harken (WSBA No. 11842, admitted 1981), of Seattle, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective September 8, 2000, following a default hearing. The discipline is based on his failing to represent two clients in a competent and diligent manner, making misrepresentations to his clients and to the Bar Association, and failing to cooperate with the Bar Association investigation.Matter 1: On March 23, 1993, Mr. Harken agreed to represent a client on a contingent-fee basis. The client was injured when she fell in a department store. In May 1995, Mr. Harken received a $12,000 settlement check made out to the client and himself, but Mr. Harken did not deposit the check into his trust account. Mr. Harken sent the client $4,619 and retained $3,777 to pay the clientâ€™s medical bills. Although he specifically told the client and the Bar Association investigators that he would pay the clientâ€™s medical bills, Mr. Harken did not do so.In September 1996, Mr. Harken testified in his deposition that the clientâ€™s funds were still in his trust account; this testimony was false. In October 1997, after the client filed suit against Mr. Harken, he sent her a statement indicating the funds were in his trust account; this statement was also false.Mr. Harken failed to cooperate with the Bar Associationâ€™s investigation of this matter.Matter 2: In January 1997, Mr. Harken agreed to represent a client injured in an automobile accident. The clientâ€™s employer had a subrogated interest in any amounts recovered to reimburse workersâ€™ compensation benefits the employe had paid to the employee.In May 1997, the insurance company issued a $28,075 settlement check to the client and Mr. Harken. In May or June 1997, Mr. Harken gave the client $4,679. The client was entitled to an additional $2,380 and the employer to $11,585. Sometime between May and November 1997, Mr. Harken removed these funds from his trust account.In December 1998, after the Department of Labor and Industries sent a letter regarding the unpaid balance, Mr. Harken sent the employer the amount due. As of the date of the findings, the client had not received the balance owed him.Mr. Harken failed to cooperate with the Bar Associationâ€™s investigation of this matter.Mr. Harkenâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring lawyers to provide competent representation; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.14, requiring lawyers to deposit client funds into the lawyerâ€™s trust account; 8.4(b), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in criminal conduct; 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RLD 2.8(a), requiring lawyers to comply with reasonable requests for information from the Bar Association.

Pope, Jr., (WSBA No. 21118, admitted 1991), of Bellevue, was ordered to receive a reprimand following approval of a stipulation by the Chief Hearing Officer on May 30, 2012. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to communicate with a client as to the clientâ€™s continued desire to file a lawsuit, and failure to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter. In 2003, Mr. Pope undertook to file a lawsuit against his clientâ€™s former employer for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Thereafter, Mr. Pope had a conversation in which his client indicated he might be looking for another lawyer to pursue the action. Mr. Pope did not hear back from his client about whether he had found another lawyer. As the statute of limitations approached, Mr. Pope did not contact his client to ascertain whether his client still wanted Mr. Pope to file the lawsuit on his behalf. Instead, Mr. Pope checked the court dockets to see if some other lawyer had filed the lawsuit. When Mr. Pope did not find that any other lawyer had filed the lawsuit, he advanced the filing fee and filed the lawsuit in Federal Court on October 4, 2004.During 2005, on two occasions, the Federal Court issued orders to show cause why the lawsuit should not be dismissed because of Mr. Popeâ€™s failure to comply with the Courtâ€™s orders as to filing a joint status report. On another occasion in 2005, the Federal Court issued an order to show cause why the lawsuit should not be dismissed for failure to serve a summons within 120 days of filing the complaint. In September 2005, the Court ordered Mr. Pope to withdraw from the representation. When Mr. Pope failed to withdraw, the Court issued an order in January 2006 removing Mr. Pope as counsel of record. Although Mr. Pope responded to the Courtâ€™s orders to show cause and prevented the lawsuit from being dismissed, Mr. Pope did not communicate with his client at all during 2005, and did not advise his client of any of the orders to show cause or the order directing Mr. Pope to withdraw. Mr. Popeâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation and, as required by Rules, to consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; and RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter.Randy Beitel represented the Bar Association.

McLendon (WSBA No. 1187, admitted 1969), of Spokane, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective March 7, 2002, following a stipulation. The discipline is based on his failure to diligently represent two clients, failure to abide by two clientsâ€™ decisions to accept settlement offers, and entering into a business transaction with a client in 1998 and 1999 without giving the client a reasonable opportunity to seek independent advice.Matter 1: In March 1995, Mr. McLendon agreed to represent a client in a personal injury matter. Mr. McLendon negotiated with the insurance company, but did not convey the companyâ€™s settlement offers to the client. In August 1997, Mr. McLendon finalized a settlement with the insurance company, without the clientâ€™s consent.Matter 2: In May 1995, Mr. McLendon agreed to represent a client in a personal injury matter. The client had been injured in an April 1995 auto accident. Mr. McLendon negotiated with the insurance carrier, but did not negotiate a settlement prior to the statute of limitations running on the clientâ€™s claim in April 1998. Mr. McLendon did not file or serve a lawsuit on the clientâ€™s claim prior to the statute of limitations running.In June 1998, when Mr. McLendon realized the statute had run, he tried to negotiate a $7,500 settlement. When the insurance company refused to negotiate, Mr. McLendon faxed a letter attempting to accept a June 3, 1997 $6,500 settlement offer. Mr. McLendon did not discuss these settlement offers with his client.In June 1999, Mr. McLendon proposed a settlement of the clientâ€™s malpractice claim against him, without advising the client to seek independent representation.(This same client had been involved in a second automobile accident in October 1996.) Mr. McLendon settled the clientâ€™s case without her knowledge or permission.Mr. McLendonâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent clients; 1.2, requiring lawyers to obtain clientsâ€™ authority prior to accepting settlement offers; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients informed about the status of their matters; 1.8(h), prohibiting lawyers from settling malpractice claims with unrepresented former clients without advising the former client in writing that independent representation is appropriate.Timothy J.

Gary Wallis (WSBA No. 6311, admitted 1975), of Tacoma, has received a reprimand pursuant to a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board on May 15, 2000. The discipline is based upon his failure to make reasonable efforts to ensure his firm correctly administered its trust account.Mr. Wallis worked for attorney Marvin Olsen from the time he was admitted to practice. In approximately 1977, Mr. Wallis and Mr. Olsen formed a partnership in which Mr. Wallis remained until 1998. During that time, Mr. Olsen was the managing partner, and had control and responsibility for the client trust account. In 1993, the Bar Association audit manager determined, after a preliminary audit, that the firmâ€™s trust account contained $14,000-$20,000 less than the known client balances. Although Mr. Wallis did not believe that he had caused the shortage, he deposited $8,000 to cure it. Mr. Wallis believed Mr. Olsen would cure the remaining shortage, but he did not.In January 1994, after a full audit, Mr. Olsen and Mr. Wallis were told that they needed to deposit $6,989.96 to cure a remaining trust account shortage. The auditor also found that the firm failed to keep complete client records, failed to keep all client funds in the trust account, used client trust funds for business with other clients, and that Mr. Olsen used client trust funds for his own business transactions. No funds were deposited into the trust account to cure the shortage.Although Mr. Wallis believed Mr. Olsen would deposit the required funds, Mr. Wallis did not verify that the firmâ€™s trust account was in compliance with the Rules for Professional Conduct. In December 1997, the auditor reported findings from a subsequent audit. The auditor found that the four problems listed above were continuing.By failing to take reasonable steps to ensure the firm properly managed the client trust account and failing to take steps to mitigate Mr. Olsenâ€™s misconduct, Mr. Wallisâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.5, 1.14, 5.1 and 5.3.Joy McLean represented the Bar Association.

186.html,6587,Irving Dane,,Disbarment,3/27/2000,,"Irving Leroy Dane (WSBA No. 6587, admitted 1976), of Vancouver, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective March 27, 2000. This discipline is based on his committing a criminal act involving moral turpitude, failing to deal properly with client funds, and engaging in conduct involving dishonesty.Matter 1: In 1991, Mr. Dane agreed to represent a client in a personal injury case against the other driver and the driverâ€™s insurance company. Mr. Dane accepted this case on a contingent fee basis, but did not provide a written fee agreement. In January, the clientâ€™s own insurance company paid her $50,000 in under-insured motorist coverage. The client endorsed the check to Mr. Dane, who deposited it into his trust account on February 13, 1992. The client understood that the money would remain in Mr. Daneâ€™s trust account until the case against the driver and the insurance company was over. On April 15, 1992, Mr. Dane withdrew $10,000 of the clientâ€™s funds from the trust account and deposited them into his business account. He used some of these funds to make the down payment on his home. On November 16, 1992, Mr. Dane withdrew an additional $15,000 of the clientâ€™s money from the trust account. He used this money to make a payment on his house. The client settled her case on November 5, 1997 for $80,000. At this time, Mr. Dane told the client that her $50,000 was still deposited in his trust account and that he was negotiating with her medical providers to waive their liens. The client did not receive any of the $50,000 payment. On July 12, 1999, Mr. Dane pleaded guilty to a first-degree theft charge based on this matter.Matter 2: In the fall of 1995, a client retained Mr. Dane to represent her son on second-degree murder charges. Mr. Dane required the mother to pay $15,000 in advance fees, plus $2,500 in costs. Mr. Dane did not provide the client a written fee agreement. The client believed she retained Mr. Dane on an hourly basis, but he believed that he was charging a set fee. Between November 27, 1995 and December 28, 1995, Mr. Dane withdrew $17,100 in attorneyâ€™s fees on this matter â€” $2,100 more than was available.Matter 3: Mr. Dane agreed to represent a client in a personal injury action against the estate of the intoxicated driver of a car that crossed the center line and seriously injured the client. Mr. Dane and the client agreed to a 33-1/3 percent contingent fee. The client received $2,276.89 from the Crime Victim Compensation Program. The Program also paid $2,479.13 of the clientâ€™s medical bills. The Program had a statutory lien on any recovery by the client. The court ordered the estate to pay the client $22,650.92, plus interest. On February 6, 1991, Mr. Dane deposited the check from the estate into his trust account. He did not pay the Crime Victim Compensation Programâ€™s lien. Between April 19, 1991 and April 15, 1992, Mr. Dane withdrew $25,922.76 from his trust account, identified as this clientâ€™s funds â€” approximately $3,000 more than was available. Mr. Dane did not pay any portion of the $22,000 to the client.Mr. Daneâ€™s conduct violated RCW 9A.56.030; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; RPC 1.14, requiring lawyers to deposit client funds into a trust account, maintain complete records of all client funds in the lawyerâ€™s possession, and promptly pay to the client, upon request, funds which the client is entitled to receive; and RLD 1.1(a), subjecting a lawyer to disciplinary action for committing a crime involving moral turpitude.Leslie Allen represented the Bar Association.

188.html,7380,Norman Maas,,Disbarment,1/3/2002,,"Norman B. Maas (WSBA No. 7380, admitted 1977), of Kenmore, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective January 3, 2002, following a hearing. The discipline is based upon his filing a frivolous claim, making false statements to a court, and obstructing another partyâ€™s access to evidence between 1982 and 1996.Mr. Maas represented his friends Mr. and Mrs. R (the Rs) in several business transactions. In 1982, Mr. R was the principal owner of a new business in need of financing. After careful analysis of the business opportunity, Mr. H, a private investor, agreed to make a $25,000 unsecured investment in the company. When the company needed more money, Mr. H. agreed to make another investment, but only if it was secured by a deed of trust on the Rsâ€™ personal residence.In March and April 1983, Mr. H verified four pre-existing lien holders on the Rsâ€™ residence. These lien holders included a savings and loan, Norman B. Maas ($12,000), a corporation wholly owned by Maas ($4,500), and the original seller of the Rsâ€™ company. Mr. H verified the current balances and arranged for the company to assume Mr. Râ€™s personal debts, to allow more security for his own loan. Mr. Maas prepared the documentation for this transaction.Mr. H loaned the company an additional $32,000 and believed that his loan was secured in second position, just behind the savings and loan. After this transfer, neither Mr. R nor his company received any further billings from Mr. Maas. The last billing, dated May 1, 1983, indicated a total outstanding bill of $1,307.67. The promissory note to Mr. Maas had a notation ""paid-in full"" written on the note. A request for reconveyance was also found, but the date was blotted out. The Maas corporation debt also indicated it had been paid in full and had a request for reconveyance. The date on this document was also unreadable.The reconveyance deed was never executed or recorded. The hearing officer concluded that no current balance was owed by the Rs to Mr. Maas at the time of the H loan. The hearing officer found that Mr. Maas participated with the clients in providing a facade of lien holders on the Rsâ€™ property so that they could exempt their home from their bankruptcy petition. The liens also assisted the client in obtaining an advantageous settlement of Internal Revenue Service claims. Mr. Maas did not discuss his own deed of trust with Mr. H when he prepared the deeds for the company loan.In April 1996, 17 years after the promissory note and deed of trust were executed, Mr. Maas commenced foreclosure proceedings against the Rs and Mr. H, among others. Mr. Maas asserted that he was owed almost $500,000 on the original $12,000 debt, based on 24 percent interest compounded monthly. During the lawsuit, Mr. Maas and the Rs cooperated with each other. Mr. Maas indicated that he did not maintain payment records, even though he had previously been in banking.The hearing officer found that, in fact, at the time the foreclosure action was filed, the Rs owed no debt to Mr. Maas. During his deposition in the civil suit, Mr. Maas testified that he had a ""gentlemanâ€™s agreement"" with his clients to put them back into a house of their choice after the foreclosure. The hearing officer also found that Mr. Maas blacked out the words ""paid in full"" on the promissory notes prior to producing them in the civil litigation.Mr. Maasâ€™s conduct violated RPC 3.1, prohibiting lawyers from filing frivolous claims; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; RPC 3.3, prohibiting lawyers from knowingly making a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal; RPC 3.4, prohibiting lawyers from unlawfully obstructing another partyâ€™s access to evidence; and RLD 1.1(p), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law.Anne I.

In February 1996, he ceased practicing law without notifying his clients.Matter 2: In 1991, Mr. Vanairsdale represented the husband in a dissolution. In March 1994 he filed a response to the wifeâ€™s dissolution petition, and in July 1995 he sent proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and decree of dissolution to the wife.

The client called Mr. Vanairsdale about these matters several times. In November 1994, he told the client he would file the QDRO within a week, but did not do so.Matter 6: In February 1991, Mr. Vanairsdale agreed to probate his clientâ€™s motherâ€™s estate.

He later represented the primeâ€™s subcontractor. The opposing party was the Army Corps of Engineers.On July 11, 1991, Dann telephoned the lawyer for the Corps of Engineers. Through a conference call feature on his telephone, Dann had the representative of the subcontractor (who was not yet a client) listening in on the call. Dann also recorded the call. Dann did not tell the opposing lawyer that Dannâ€™s client was listening in or that Dann was recording the call. Dann did not have the lawyerâ€™s permission for either. During the telephone call, Dann stated to the opposing lawyer, ""Iâ€™ve got to call [the sub-contractorâ€™s representative] as soon as we hang up . . . .""Dann had the tape recording transcribed and gave it to another party in the matter without the recorded lawyerâ€™s knowledge or permission. The recorded lawyer found out about the recording from the other party.By surreptitiously allowing the client to listen in on the telephone conversation with the opposing lawyer, Dann violated RPC 8.4(c), which provides that ""[i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to . . . engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation[.]"" Also by surreptitiously recording that telephone conversation, Dann violated Rule 8.4(c).Disciplinary Counsel David Cluxton and Lisa Crawford represented the Association.

Both suffered separate workplace injuries and received benefits from the Department of Labor and Industries. Several years later, the clients pled guilty to felony charges. The Department of Labor and Industries issued an order suspending the clientsâ€™ benefits during the time they served their sentences. Mr. Stiley appealed this order to the Industrial Insurance Appeals Board (Board). The Industrial Appeals Judge issued a scheduling order with deadlines for submitting factual stipulations and briefing. Mr. Stiley failed to file the required pleadings prior to the ordered deadlines. The Judge granted Mr. Stiley additional time to file his pleadings. Mr. Stiley submitted a factual stipulation two days after the continued date and did not submit a brief. The Department of Labor and Industries filed a motion to dismiss the clientsâ€™ appeal. Mr. Stiley did not file a response to the motion to dismiss. During this time period, Mr. Stiley was representing other clients in out-of-county and out-of-state proceedings. Mr. Stiley sent two legal interns to the dismissal hearing to inform the Judge that he could not attend, because he was representing another client in a federal court criminal proceeding. The Judge entered a proposed order dismissing the clientsâ€™ appeal, citing the ""unexcused failure of Mr. Stiley to present evidence at the time set for hearing and for otherwise failing to comply with the pre-hearing order."" The Board denied Mr. Stileyâ€™s petition for review of this order. The Superior Court affirmed the Boardâ€™s decision. By failing to timely file a brief supporting his clientsâ€™ claims, Mr. Stileyâ€™s conduct violated Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3, requiring a lawyer to exercise reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.Jonathan Burke represented the Bar Association.

Wilson (WSBA No. 12012, admitted 1981), of Tacoma, was suspended for 30 days following a stipulation by order of the Supreme Court dated May 5, 2000. The suspension began June 15, 2000, and Mr. Wilson has been returned to active status. The discipline is based upon his failure to diligently represent and communicate adequately and truthfully with a client.On February 10, 1992, Ms. T retained Mr. Wilson to represent her in a personal injury claim. On December 7, 1992, Ms. T wrote Mr. Wilson a letter complaining about the lack of progress in her case and that he did not return her phone calls. On August 2, 1993, Ms. T wrote Mr. Wilson another letter asking him to provide an accounting of the work he had performed and to explain whether a lawsuit had been filed. Mr. Wilson met with her and promised to work on the case.On August 31, 1993, Mr. Wilson filed a lawsuit against the driver of a car that hit Ms. T. Mr. Wilsonâ€™s nonlawyer assistant told Ms. T that the driver had been served with the lawsuit and that he had hired a lawyer in Seattle. A few days later, Mr. Wilson filed a confirmation of service indicating that the driver had not been served because he had moved to England and had not left an address. The weekend before the statute of limitations ran out, Mr. Wilson realized that the complaint had not been served. He dictated pleadings to serve the secretary of state, but these were not prepared because of computer problems in his office. Because Mr. Wilson served the complaint two days after the statute of limitations expired, the driver successfully moved to have the lawsuit dismissed.Ms. T retained another lawyer to represent her. Mr. Wilson told the new lawyer that he was responsible for the loss of Ms. Tâ€™s case and that he wanted to settle her malpractice claim, but he did not have malpractice insurance. In June 1994, Mr. Wilson filed bankruptcy and did not list Ms. T as a creditor. In March 1999, Mr. Wilson agreed to pay Ms. T $125,000 over four years, and agreed that the debt would be nondischargeable. Mr. Wilson has made some payments to Ms. T.Mr. Wilsonâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep their clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters; 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; 8.4(a), prohibiting violating the RPCs through the acts of another; 5.3, requiring lawyers to make reasonable efforts to ensure that nonlawyer assistantsâ€™ conduct is compatible with the RPCs; and 3.3, prohibiting a lawyer from making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal.Anne Seidel represented the Bar Association.

This discipline is based on his failure to diligently represent a client in a bankruptcy matter from 1991 to 1993.In August 1991, Mr. Johnson agreed to represent clients in a judgment lien. Mr. Johnson recommended that the clients file Chapter 7 bankruptcy, assuring them that the bankruptcy would avoid the imminent supplemental proceedings and prevent them from losing their home. Mr. Johnson filed the clientsâ€™ bankruptcy petition in August. He did not explain to the clients that a bankruptcy discharge relieves the debtor of the debt, and that a motion and brief hearing are necessary to avoid a judgment lien on exempt property. On December 2, 1991, the court entered the order discharging the clientâ€™s bankruptcy. Because no motion to avoid the judgment lien was filed, the lien remained against the clientâ€™s home.On May 11, 1992, the clients sold their home, with the purchaser assuming the clientsâ€™ mortgage. As part of the sale, the clients agreed to pay all liens or encumbrances against the property. Several months later, when the purchaser attempted to refinance, she learned that the home was encumbered by the judgment lien.On January 22, 1993, Mr. Johnson filed a motion to avoid the judgment, without disclosing that the home had been sold. On April 4, the court indicated it would grant the motion to avoid the lien, but that the clients would have to pay the judgment debtorâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees incurred in responding to the late motion. In June, the clients informed Mr. Johnson that they believed he should pay the $2,521.96 attorneyâ€™s fee. Mr. Johnson withdrew from the clientsâ€™ case and sent them a bill for $515. The order to avoid the lien was approved by the judgment debtor, but never entered by the court. In September 1993, a friend of the purchaser paid the attorneyâ€™s fee to clear the judgment lien.Mr. Johnsonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4, requiring lawyers to explain matters to the extent reasonably necessary to permit clients to make informed decisions regarding their representation.Jonathan Burke represented the Bar Association.

215.html,8935,Grant Kinnear,,Suspension,6/23/2000,,"Grant Kinnear (WSBA No. 8935, admitted 1979), of Seattle, was suspended for 60 days following a stipulation approved by order of the Supreme Court dated June 13, 2000. The discipline is based upon his practicing law while his license was suspended, failing to diligently represent a client, and misrepresentation. The suspension became effective June 23, 2000. Mr. Kinnear has since been reinstated.Matter 1:On March 10, 1998, the Supreme Court suspended Mr. Kinnearâ€™s license to practice law for failure to comply with continuing legal education reporting requirements. Mr. Kinnear received notice of this suspension on March 11, 1998. After receiving this notice, Mr. Kinnear continued to practice law in two matters.In April 1998, he represented a client in a mediation. He did not inform the mediator that his license to practice had been suspended. The opposing counsel asked Mr. Kinnear before the mediation if he was an active member of the WSBA. Mr. Kinnear untruthfully said that he was an active member. Following the mediation, Mr. Kinnear withdrew from the representation and arranged for another lawyer to represent the client.In the second case, Mr. Kinnear attended the closing of a refinance of a commercial building on behalf of a client who knew that Mr. Kinnearâ€™s license had been suspended.On July 15, 1998, a WSBA employee called Mr. Kinnearâ€™s law office. The person answering the phone said, ""law office,"" and indicated that Mr. Kinnear was practicing law in that office. Mr. Kinnear was a tenant in an office-sharing arrangement with several other lawyers. The receptionist did not know about his license suspension. Although Mr. Kinnear did not remove his name from the building directory during his suspension, he did not take new clients or bill existing clients for work done during this time. Mr. Kinnearâ€™s license to practice law was reinstated on February 24,1999.Matter 2:From fall 1993 until fall 1997, Mr. Kinnear represented the West Shore Tenants Association (WSTA). After a lengthy administrative appeals process and several attempts at mediation, WSTA asked Mr. Kinnear to file a federal court lawsuit on behalf of some tenants. In December 1997, after some delay, Mr. Kinnear told several WSTA members that the complaint had been filed when in fact it had not. Although there was no statute of limitations on this lawsuit, the issues involved were financially important to WSTA members and the resolution was delayed. The sanction analysis in this matter involved mitigating factors.By continuing to practice law after receiving notice that his license to practice had been suspended, Mr. Kinnearâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 5.5(a) and 1.15(a)(1), and RLD 8.2. By falsely telling WSTA members that the complaint had been filed, Mr. Kinnearâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, 1.4(a),  and 8.4(c).Anne I. Seidel represented the Bar Association. Wesley N. Edmunds represented Mr. Kinnear",1.15,Declining or Terminating Representation,Client-Lawyer Relationship,1.3,Diligence,Client-Lawyer Relationship,1.4,Communication,Client-Lawyer Relationship,5.5,Unauthorized Practice of Law,Law Firms and Associations,8.4c,"Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit or Misrepresentation",Maintaining the Integrity of the Profession,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maslan (WSBA No.1213, admitted 1966), of Seattle, was suspended for six months, effective February 5, 2001,by order of the Court following a default hearing. This discipline is based on his failure to diligently represent and communicate with a client.In early 1993, the Pierce County Superior Court admitted Mr. Hâ€™s will to probate and appointed MH as personal representative (PR) of the estate. On July 26, 1993, counsel for the estate appointed Mr. Maslan as co-counsel and indicated that counsel was beginning a sabbatical effective August 1, 1993. Mr. Maslan and the client did not have an agreement regarding Mr. Maslanâ€™s fees. At the time Mr. Maslan took over this estate, several creditor claims were pending. In June 1993, the PR sold two parcels of real estate. The purchaser defaulted on the payments for one parcel. The purchaser and the PR were not able to resolve the default, so Mr. Maslan took steps to initiate foreclosure. Mr. Maslan twice directed the escrow agent to send him fees for his role in the forfeiture. Mr. Maslan did no further work on the estate until July 1995, when he filed a notice of withdrawal. Mr. Maslan indicated that until he was paid for his work, he had no obligation to complete the estate or communicate with the client. Mr. Maslanâ€™s conduct did not harm any creditors, the client or the beneficiary. Mr. Maslan also failed to respond to requests for information from disciplinary counsel.Mr. Maslanâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.4(a), requiring lawyers to keep clientâ€™s reasonably informed of the status of their matters; and RLD 2.8(a), requiring lawyers to promptly comply with requests for information from disciplinary counsel.William J.

224.html,9756,Grosvenor Anschell,,Suspension,10/30/2000,,"Grosvenor Anschell (WSBA No. 9756, admitted 1954), of Bellevue, has been suspended for two years, effective October 30, 2000, by order of the Supreme Court, following a hearing. For more information, please see the Supreme Court opinion.Matter 1: In October 1992, a husband and wife paid Mr. Anschell $430 to submit citizenship applications for them and their children to become naturalized citizens of the United States. Both parents are Egyptian citizens and had been permanent residents of the United States for several years; the children are Canadian citizens. The parents completed the naturalization applications on October 27, 1992.Between this date and September 1994, the clients periodically contacted Mr. Anschell about the status of their case. He told them that the applications had been filed, and that they should not worry. In a September 1, 1994 declaration, Mr. Anschell indicated that he filed the applications, but in fact, the applications were not filed. Failure to file delayed the clientâ€™s case by over two and a half years. The clients filed a legal malpractice suit and obtained a $68,483.63 default judgment against Mr. Anschell.Matter 2: On October 5, 1994, a client retained Mr. Anschell to apply for a change of visa status for herself and her daughter. The client needed to change her status from temporary professional worker to visitor/tourist while she looked for employment. Her status was set to expire on October 10, 1994; the daughter wanted to become a permanent resident.Mr. Anschell did not file the daughterâ€™s change-of-status application, nor did he file the motherâ€™s change-of-status form until October 25, 1994, after her legal status had expired. Additionally, Mr. Anschell did not comply with an Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) order to file the clientâ€™s form I-797 by April 26, 1995. Because of these delays, the INS denied the clientâ€™s application due to abandonment. The INS decision indicated that the client had the option to file a motion to re-open within 30 days or submit a new application and fee. Mr. Anschell did not inform the client of the order or her options.On April 8, 1995, the client found new employment, and again retained Mr. Anschell to change her status back from visitor/tourist to temporary professional worker. She was not aware of the earlier loss of her legal status.In late 1995 and early 1996, Mr. Anschell did not respond to his clientâ€™s questions regarding her case. In February 1996, the clientâ€™s employer contacted Mr. Anschell regarding the clientâ€™s status; however, Mr. Anschell did not reply.In March 1996, the client retained new counsel, and requested that Mr. Anschell forward all papers relating to her case to her new counsel. Mr. Anschell did not respond to this request. The INS denied the client and daughterâ€™s change-of-status applications because they were out of legal status. As a result, the client and her daughter had to return to England for approximately three weeks and reapply from there to legally re-enter the United States.Matter 3: On April 7, 1995, Mr. Anschell agreed to represent the wife of an American citizen in her application for permanent resident status. The clients also asked Mr. Anschell to obtain a passport for the wifeâ€™s daughter, who had been living in Germany. In April 1995, the clients completed the forms, and provided Mr. Anschell with the documentation and required fees.In October 1995, the clients requested proof that Mr. Anschell had filed the wifeâ€™s application. Mr. Anschell promised to fax the documents, but never did. The clients then sent a certified letter giving Mr. Anschell until December 1, 1995 to either send proof that he had filed the application, or return the clientsâ€™ money and INS packet. Mr. Anschell did not respond.Mr. Anschell did not file the clientsâ€™ application, and lost the wife and daughterâ€™s files. At the time of the hearing, he had not located the daughterâ€™s original German passport or the wifeâ€™s original medical papers.Matter 4: Mr. Anschell failed to cooperate with the investigations of these matters. He failed to return phone calls and answer written requests for information. Disciplinary counsel was compelled to depose Mr. Anschell twice.Mr. Anschellâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.4(a), requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters and to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; 1.4(b), requiring lawyers to explain matters to the extent reasonably necessary to permit clients to make informed decisions regarding their respresentation; 1.5(a), requiring lawyersâ€™ fees to be reasonable; 1.15(d), requiring lawyers, when withdrawing from a case, to take reasonable steps to protect a clientâ€™s interests; and RLD 2.8, requiring lawyers to cooperate with disciplinary counsel investigations.Bernadette Janet and Douglas Ende represented the Bar Association.

225.html,16597,Robert Dollinger,,Disbarment,1/22/1999,,"Robert Dollinger (WSBA No. 16597, admitted November 18, 1986), of Wenatchee, has been disbarred following a hearing, by order of the Supreme Court filed January 22, 1999. The discipline is based upon his repeated deposits of client and firm funds into his personal accounts, and failure to maintain any records regarding these transactions.From 1987 through 1992, Mr. Dollinger was employed by a Wenatchee law firm and was not authorized to ""moonlight."" Mr. Dollinger collected a check for an advance fee deposit from a firm client. He cashed this check without the firmâ€™s or the clientâ€™s knowledge and converted the funds for his own use. In another matter, Mr. Dollinger requested two checks from the firmâ€™s accountant. Mr. Dollinger used these funds to pay for personal travel expenses for himself and his wife. When a partner in the firm questioned these expenses, Mr. Dollinger stated that the funds were used for firm business. The firm terminated Mr. Dollingerâ€™s employment.From May 7, 1992 through June 30, 1995, Mr. Dollinger was employed by another Wenatchee firm. This law firm also did not authorize ""moonlighting."" In several instances, Mr. Dollinger failed to deposit client funds into the firm trust account. In one instance, Mr. Dollinger had a clientâ€™s settlement check sent to his home. Mr. Dollinger deposited part of the settlement into his personal checking account and the rest into his personal savings account. Mr. Dollinger then requested that the firm accountant write off the clientâ€™s fees and expenses. In another instance, Mr. Dollinger deposited a clientâ€™s $7,500 settlement check into his personal account. He then purchased a $5,345.40 cashierâ€™s check made payable to the client. He also requested that the firm accountant write off the fees and expenses in this matter. He did not maintain any records of this transaction. In a third instance, Mr. Dollinger represented four clients in a personal injury matter. He received four settlement checks, but only disclosed the existence of one. He deposited the first settlement check into the firm trust account. Mr. Dollinger deposited the remaining three settlement checks into his personal account and wrote the clients personal checks for a portion of the original amount. Again, Mr. Dollinger requested that the firm accountant write off the clientâ€™s fees and expenses. He maintained no records of these transactions. In several other matters, Mr. Dollinger deposited client settlement funds into his personal account and wrote personal checks to the clients. In another instance, the firm learned that Mr. Dollinger was representing a client. When a partner questioned Mr. Dollinger, he denied any knowledge of the client. Eventually, Mr. Dollinger admitted that he represented this client, but explained that he did not tell the firm because he was not charging a fee. He then wrote a letter stating that he intended to collect a one-third fee. In another instance, Mr. Dollinger told his firm that he would be arguing a case in Yakima all day. In fact, he participated in the argument by telephone while flying from Wenatchee to Phoenix. Mr. Dollinger billed the client for a seven-hour argument, when the actual argument took much less time. Mr. Dollinger told a firm partner that he would ""catch up"" later in the month. The firm did not send this bill to the client.By repeatedly failing to deposit client funds into the trust account and maintain records of transactions with client funds, Mr. Dollinger violated RPCs 1.14(a) and (b)(3). By depositing client funds into his personal accounts, Mr. Dollinger violated RPC 8.4(c), which prohibits conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. By lying about attending the Yakima argument personally and about the amount of time spent at this argument, Mr. Dollinger violated RPCs 4.1(a) prohibiting making a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; and RPC 8.4(c). The hearing officer found that Mr. Dollingerâ€™s guilty plea to a first-degree theft charge involving these same facts indicated that Mr. Dollingerâ€™s actions were intentional.

226.html,15170,Robert Lincoln,,Suspension,2/9/1999,,"Robert J. Lincoln (WSBA No. 15170, admitted August 5, 1985), of King County, has been suspended for 12 months pursuant to a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board on January 15, 1999 and by the Supreme Court on February 9, 1999. The suspension is based on multiple acts of misconduct.First Matter: Mr. Lincoln represented a father in a residential placement dispute in Chelan County Superior Court. Prior to the trial, the clientâ€™s mother, Mrs. S, was involved in an altercation with the childrenâ€™s mother. Based on this altercation, Mr. Lincoln filed a motion to have the children reside primarily with the father. In support of this motion, Mr. Lincoln submitted Mrs. Sâ€™s declaration. Mr. Lincoln signed Mrs. Sâ€™s name to this declaration and placed his initials next to the signature. Mr. Lincoln believed that his initials were legible. Neither opposing counsel nor the judge recognized Mr. Lincolnâ€™s initials. Mr. Lincoln did not tell opposing counsel or the judge that he signed the declaration. Mrs. S stated that she did not know that Mr. Lincoln was signing the declaration for her. Although Mr. Lincoln believed that the declaration was accurate, Mrs. S stated that it had some inaccuracies. During the trial, Mrs. S testified that she did not sign the declaration. Mr. Lincoln then explained to the Court that he signed the declaration.By filing with the court a declaration containing negligently false statements, and signing his name on behalf of a witness without bringing this fact to the Courtâ€™s and opposing counselâ€™s attention, Mr. Lincoln violated RPC 3.3, prohibiting making a false statement of fact to a tribunal.Second Matter: In April 1995, Mr. Lincoln agreed to represent a client in a dissolution. The client paid Mr. Lincoln $500. Mr. Lincolnâ€™s fee agreement stated that $500 was the fee for an uncontested dissolution proceeding. The fee agreement also stated that the fee for a contested case was $3,000, and that it became due immediately. The following handwritten definition of ""contested"" was included in the fee agreement: ""any disagreement or dispute in which the attorney must intervene, mediate or defend, including the intentional act of one spouse to avoid service of process, or any other lack of cooperation, delay, or failure to promptly produce records or documents, or the hiring of an attorney by the other spouse. The word ""contested"" also includes the clientâ€™s behavior in which the client fails to heed the advice of the attorney, compounds problems, or makes the attorneyâ€™s efforts more complex or difficult.""The client decided to serve the pleadings on her husband to save the cost of a process server. She left the pleadings and some of her husbandâ€™s belongings with a Navy officer, with instructions to deliver the items to her husband. The client also paid Mr. Lincoln a $120 filing fee, which he did not deposit to his trust account. Shortly after this, the client instructed Mr. Lincoln not to proceed with the dissolution and to return all of her fees and costs. Originally, Mr. Lincoln wrote to the client, stating that he would not return any of her money, including the unused filing fee. Mr. Lincoln wrote that the clientâ€™s husband had evaded service and, therefore, she owed him the $3,000 contested fee, less the amounts she had already paid. The client filed suit in small claims court. The Court found that all of the fees and costs, including the unused filing fee, were reasonable and allowed Mr. Lincoln to retain the clientâ€™s funds. Mr. Lincoln returned the unused filing fee despite the court order.By failing to place the clientâ€™s advance costs into his trust account and by applying these funds to his fees, Mr. Lincolnâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.14, requiring that advances for costs be deposited into the trust account and that the lawyer preserve the identity of client funds. Third Matter: Mr. Lincoln agreed to represent the husband in a dissolution action. Mr. Lincoln used the same fee agreement with the $3,000 contested fee clause, but this agreement also set an hourly rate of $125. The client paid $2,500 in fees, in installments, and also exchanged a jewelry box for $500. Mr. Lincoln prepared the petition and summons in late September 1994 and signed the pleadings in mid-October. The petition was filed on November 17, 1994. After many phone calls to Mr. Lincoln, some answered and some not, the client sent Mr. Lincoln a certified letter asking about the status of his case. Mr. Lincoln did not respond to the clientâ€™s letter. On December 14, 1994, at a temporary orders hearing, the court awarded $1,000 per month to the wife in child support and maintenance payments, retroactive to November 1, 1994. At this hearing, the court did not have the clientâ€™s financial information, because Mr. Lincoln had misfiled this information and had not delivered working copies to the court. Although the client told Mr. Lincoln he could not afford these payments, Mr. Lincoln took no steps to reduce them. The Office of Support Enforcement began garnishing the clientâ€™s wages, and eventually he was forced to give up his apartment and move in with friends. In February 1995, the client retained a new lawyer, who successfully reduced the support and maintenance payments. Mr. Lincolnâ€™s failure to act diligently violated RPC 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients. By failing to answer his clientâ€™s questions regarding the status of his case, Mr. Lincoln violated RPC 1.4, requiring that a lawyer keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with the clientâ€™s reasonable requests for information. By using a fee agreement allowing Mr. Lincoln to unilaterally determine whether fees would be increased, Mr. Lincoln violated RPC 1.5, requiring reasonable fees.Fourth Matter: Mr. Lincoln agreed to represent the husband in a dissolution action. He met with the client and his parents. Mr. Lincoln told the client that his fee would be $3,000. This fee would cover legal service up to one year, excluding trial. The client paid Mr. Lincoln $650 in cash, and the parents wrote two checks for $1,175 each, postdating the second. The fee agreement was similar to the one used in the other matters and included the statement ""client agrees to pay all expenses including any balance due before entitled to client file."" On May 17, 1996, the client and his parents attended a court hearing in the dissolution case. Apparently, the opposing counsel prepared the order and Mr. Lincoln did not explain the order to the clientâ€™s and parentsâ€™ satisfaction. Over the next two weeks, the client became dissatisfied with Mr. Lincolnâ€™s services, terminated Mr. Lincoln, and requested a refund of unearned fees. The clientâ€™s mother stopped payment on the postdated check, without notice to Mr. Lincoln. Mr. Lincoln wrote to the mother in an attempt to collect the additional $1,175. His letter stated that he had the option of taking legal action to collect the check, but he did not follow through.By failing to adequately explain the court order, Mr. Lincoln violated RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to explain a clientâ€™s matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions. By failing to place disputed fees in his trust account, Mr. Lincoln violated RPC 1.14(b)(2), requiring lawyers to place funds belonging in part to the lawyer and in part to the client in the lawyerâ€™s trust account, and to take prompt steps to resolve the dispute. By using a fee agreement allowing Mr. Lincoln to unilaterally determine whether fees would be increased, Mr. Lincoln violated RPC 1.5, requiring reasonable fees.Fifth Matter: Mr. Lincoln agreed to represent the wife in a dissolution action. The client signed a fee agreement which set a fee of $650 for legal service up to one year, exclusive of trial. The agreement stated that the fee for trial would be $6,500. The client paid Mr. Lincoln $725. The client told Mr. Lincoln that her primary concern in the dissolution was the parenting plan, because her spouse had been arrested for making obscene phone calls to the childrenâ€™s babysitter. The client requested that the court determine if the spouse was stable enough to have visitation, that this visitation be limited, increase gradually, and that the outcome of the criminal proceeding be considered. The client stated that she had to repeat these fact requests each time she spoke with Mr. Lincoln. Additionally, the client states that she provided Mr. Lincoln with multiple copies of the same documents, including pay stubs and daycare receipts. Mr. Lincoln stated that the client never gave him complete financial information. Mr. Lincoln met with the client in July 1996 in a Bellevue restaurant. The client states that Mr. Lincoln gave her a parenting plan drafted by the opposing lawyer to review, and then he moved to another table to meet with another client. The client stated that although she had questions about the parenting plan, she signed it and dropped it off with Mr. Lincoln, to avoid interrupting his meeting with another client. In August 1996, the client met with Mr. Lincoln to sign the final parenting plan. Apparently, when the client stated that the parenting plan did not address her husbandâ€™s arrest, Mr. Lincoln told the client that he believed she was refusing to sign the parenting plan to punish her husband and that this was not proper. Two days later, Mr. Lincoln notified the client in writing that he was withdrawing from her case. The client retained a new lawyer and the court accepted the unchanged parenting plan.By failing to adequately explain the parenting plan to the client, Mr. Lincolnâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent necessary to permit the client to make an informed decision. By failing to place disputed fees in his trust account, Mr. Lincolnâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.14(b)(2), requiring lawyers to place funds belonging in part to the lawyer and in part to the client, in the lawyerâ€™s trust account and to take prompt steps to resolve the dispute. By using a fee agreement allowing Mr. Lincoln to unilaterally determine whether fees would be increased, Mr. Lincoln violated RPC 1.5, requiring reasonable fees.Sixth Matter: Mr. Lincoln met with a client and her father regarding a residential placement issue. The client signed, and the father initialed, a fee agreement setting a fee of $1,150 for a non-contested matter and $3,000 for a contested matter. This agreement used the same definitions of ""contested."" The fee agreement was similar to the one used in the other cases, but stated that Mr. Lincoln would ""advise and assist in all aspects of the case."" The father gave Mr. Lincoln a $1,175 check. The client was separated from her spouse, who lived in Florida. In October 1995, the client and her son visited the father in Florida. The parents fought and the client was charged with domestic violence. The father then obtained an injunction from a court in Florida awarding him temporary custody of the son. Mr. Lincoln told the client that he believed that if the father filed for dissolution in Florida, the client would have to litigate the case in Florida with Florida counsel. Over the next few weeks, Mr. Lincoln performed some legal research and spoke to the client and her parents a few times. In January 1996, the father filed for dissolution in Florida. On February 1, 1996, Mr. Lincoln met with the client and her father and told them that the client should retain counsel in Florida, and that he would assist in having the case moved back to Washington. The client and her father demanded all of their money back and Mr. Lincoln declined their request. By failing to place disputed fees in his trust account, Mr. Lincoln violated RPC 1.14(b)(2), requiring lawyers to place funds belonging in part to the lawyer and in part to the client in the lawyerâ€™s trust account and to take prompt steps to resolve the dispute. By using a fee agreement allowing Mr. Lincoln to unilaterally determine whether fees would be increased, Mr. Lincoln violated RPC 1.5, requiring reasonable fees.Seventh Matter: Mr. Lincoln agreed to represent a client in an action to invalidate her marriage. The client signed a fee agreement setting the fee at $3,000. This fee agreement was similar to the others. In July 1996, the client retained Mr. Lincoln to represent her in an additional case filed against her by her husband and his parents. The client agreed to pay Mr. Lincoln $875 to appear in court and argue a protective order motion in this second matter. The client assisted by obtaining all of the necessary declarations for this motion. The Court ruled in the clientâ€™s favor on the husbandâ€™s motion and against her on the parentâ€™s motion. The client believed that Mr. Lincoln was not prepared for the hearing. In December 1996, approximately 90 days before trial, Mr. Lincoln told the client that the invalidity case was headed to trial and that the client needed to pay the $6,500 fee. The client asked Mr. Lincoln to do what he could to avoid trial, or she would be forced to find another lawyer. As a result of this conversation, Mr. Lincoln withdrew from the case, effective January 15, 1997. Mr. Lincoln stated that the client expressly terminated his services. Mr. Lincoln did not respond to several motions filed by opposing counsel on January 7, 1997.By failing to adequately communicate with his client, Mr. Lincoln violated RPC 1.4, requiring that a lawyer keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with the clientâ€™s reasonable requests for information. By using a fee agreement allowing Mr. Lincoln to unilaterally determine whether fees would be increased, Mr. Lincoln violated RPC 1.5, requiring reasonable fees. By failing to take adequate steps to protect his client in the motions filed prior to the effective date of his withdrawal, Mr. Lincolnâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.15, requiring that upon withdrawal, a lawyer take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect the clientâ€™s interests.Eighth Matter: Mr. Lincoln agreed to represent the wife in a dissolution action. She signed a brief fee agreement setting the contested fee at $3,000. This fee would cover proceedings, exclusive of trial, for one year. The fee agreement also stated that the fee was ""non-trust, non-refundable."" The client paid Mr. Lincoln $1,000. Mr. Lincoln drafted the initial pleadings. The husband and wife simultaneously served each other with initial pleadings. The client called and asked Mr. Lincoln to explain the pleadings that had been served on her.

On August 16, 1990, King County Northeast District Court granted Mr. Scharmach a Deferred Prosecution on a fourth-degree assault charge. Apparently, this matter was dismissed on August 27, 1992. Prior to the dismissal, on June 29, 1992, an Olympia police officer observed Mr. Scharmach in his pickup truck stopped in the traffic lanes, forcing traffic to steer around him. The officer spoke to Mr. Scharmach and noticed an odor of intoxicants, slurred speech, confusion, disorientation and unsteadiness on his feet. Mr. Scharmach told the officer that he was looking for the courthouse because he was scheduled to meet a client. The officer arrested Mr. Scharmach for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and transported him to the Thurston County Jail. Mr. Scharmach bailed himself of jail. The police gave Mr. Scharmach a ride to a taxi stand and instructed him not to drive. Approximately an hour later, the same police officer noticed Mr. Scharmach, in his pickup, stopped at a red light. The policeman again booked Mr. Scharmach for DUI and Mr. Scharmach again bailed himself out and drove away. Mr. Scharmach was charged with two counts of DUI. He petitioned the court to grant him a deferred prosecution. As part of this petition, Mr. Scharmach stated under penalty of perjury that he had not been granted a deferred prosecution with-in the last five years.On December 20, 1993, Mr. Scharmach pled guilty to fourth-degree assault in Bainbridge Island Municipal Court. On December 22, 1993, Mr. Scharmach was convicted in Bainbridge Island Municipal Court of possession of a loaded weapon. Based on these criminal violations, the court revoked the deferred prosecution and sentenced Mr. Scharmach to two years in jail. Mr. Scharmach acknowledged that he has an alcohol problem. He sporadically attends alcohol treatment.By making a false statement about the prior deferred prosecution, Mr. Scharmach violated RPC 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact to a tribunal; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting criminal conduct reflecting adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.

The discipline is based on Ms. Wheatonâ€™s failure to promptly and diligently protect her clients during a time of illness that resulted in closing her practice.In 1992, Ms. Wheaton opened a solo practice in Lacey, Washington. In fall 1996, Ms. Wheaton contracted with a company to provide complete office support, including client billing, accounting, trust account records, and secretarial services. Due to illness and continuing health problems, Ms. Wheaton provided a power of attorney to the contracted office manager and requested that the manager assume primary responsibility for the trust account. In November 1996, Ms. Wheaton suffered a severe physical assault which affected her mental and physical health. During this same period, Ms. Wheaton suffered other personal problems. Ms. Wheaton was hospitalized for 34 of the 44 days between November 24, 1996 and January 10, 1997. During late fall 1996, Ms. Wheaton and her support staff contacted other Thurston County lawyers to handle imminent client matters. On December 20, 1996, WSBA appointed an RLD 8.6 custodian was appointed to assist Ms. Wheaton in closing her practice. On March 27, 1997, Ms. Wheaton transferred to inactive status. In early summer 1997, after an order discharging the custodian, he returned unclaimed files to Ms. Wheaton, as her health improved. Ms. Wheaton has been in good health for the last 18 months. The Court reinstated Ms. Wheaton to active status on February 9, 1999.  In November 1996, WSBA received notice that Ms. Wheatonâ€™s trust account was $119.84 overdrawn. One client filed a grievance related to client funds and Ms. Wheaton paid restitution to that client. Additionally, Ms. Wheaton agreed to two yearsâ€™ trust account probation.In July 1996, a client retained Ms. Wheaton to obtain an order establishing parentage, setting child support, and limiting the fatherâ€™s contact with the child. In mid-July, Ms. Wheaton filed the Petition to Establish Parentage, and obtained a waiver of the filing fee and a temporary restraining order against the father. Ms. Wheaton did not serve the alleged father. In fall 1996, Ms. Wheaton did not communicate with her client and did not explain that she had not served the father. Later in 1996, Ms. Wheaton became ill and WSBA appointed a custodian. In January 1997, the client received her file from the custodian. This was the clientâ€™s first notice that Ms. Wheaton had not proceeded with her case. Ms. Wheaton made a partial refund to the client.In late August 1996, Ms. Wheaton agreed to represent the husband in a dissolution action. In October 1996, the wife filed a Petition for Legal Separation; Motion for Temporary Support, Including Maintenance; and Proposed Parenting Plan. In November 1996, Ms. Wheaton filed financial information and resisted the maintenance request. The temporary orders hearing was set for November 12, 1996. Ms. Wheaton did not attend due to her illness. Ms. Wheatonâ€™s staff contacted the opposing party, who did not agree to a continuance. The Court entered an order imposing child support, maintenance and attorneyâ€™s fees on the client. In December 1996, Ms. Wheatonâ€™s staff notified the client that Ms. Wheaton would not be able to continue to represent him. The client obtained a new lawyer on December 6, 1996. The new lawyer had to copy the court file, because Ms. Wheatonâ€™s office was already closed. In January 1997, the client filed an application with the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection and received a gift of $500. In December 1998, Ms. Wheaton reimbursed the Fund for this gift.In July 1996, Ms. Wheaton agreed to represent the wife in a dissolution. Ms. Wheaton prepared the pleadings and sent them to her client in Germany. Ms. Wheaton received the signed pleadings back from the client in November 1996. By this time, she was ill and took no further action on this clientâ€™s case. The client received her file from the custodian. The signed pleadings were still in the file. Ms. Wheaton paid restitution to this client.By failing to properly advise her clients of problems in their cases and failing to promptly advise clients of her own illness, Ms. Wheaton violated RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to explain matters to the extent necessary to permit the client to make an informed decision; and RPC 1.15, requiring a lawyer to withdraw from a clientâ€™s case if the lawyerâ€™s physical or mental condition materially impairs his or her ability to represent the client.Maria Regimbal represented the Bar Association.

230.html,1588,James Caplinger,,Disbarment,1/28/1998,,"Lawyer James J. Caplinger (WSBA No. 1588, admitted 1953) was disbarred pursuant to a stipulation for discipline, approved January 28, 1998, by the Washington Supreme Court. The discipline is based upon his neglect of a probate matter and violation of a court order by failing to turn over estate or trust funds and records and by paying himself additional attorneyâ€™s fees and costs from estate funds. Caplinger was named personal representative with non-intervention powers of an estate; he also served as attorney for the personal representative. The principal beneficiary of the estate was a trust. When the institutional trustee refused to serve in 1984, Caplinger was named interim trustee; he never sought a permanent trustee in violation of RPC 1.3 (diligence). Decedentâ€™s 22 year-old daughter was the sole beneficiary of the trust. In 1984, the daughter filed a request for special notice; beginning in 1991, she requested accountings of the estate and trust. Between August 1985 and January 1994, Caplinger made no accounting, paid monies to himself (without notice to the daughter) and took no steps to close the probate of the estate in violation of RPC 1.3 (diligence) and 1.4 (communication).In November 1993, Caplinger was removed as trustee and personal representative by court order, for cause, and was ordered to immediately turn over all trust and estate property including records in his possession. In addition, he was ordered to account in both the estate and the trust. In January 1994, Caplinger signed and filed with the court a ""Report and Accounting of Personal Representative/Trustee & Final Account"" and an affidavit regarding his fees as personal representative, trustee and attorney. Although the trust had received more than $200,000 in liquid assets, Caplinger turned over the sum of only $13,317.04. The report states that the bulk of the estate and trust assets and income were expended for the use and benefit of the daughter, but the records were inadequate to verify this statement. In addition, Caplinger paid himself $14,755.25 from the estate as attorneyâ€™s fees or costs without court approval after the November 1993 order.In August 1994, Caplinger was held in contempt of court for his failure to provide required records and for paying himself with estate funds in violation of the November 1993 order. Caplingerâ€™s actions violated RPC 1.14(b)(3) (requiring a lawyer keep records of client funds; RPC 1.14(b)(4) (requiring a lawyer to promptly deliver funds belonging to a client); RPC 8.4 (c) (requiring a lawyer to refrain from acts involving dishonesty, deceit or misrepresentation); and RPC 8.4 (d) (requiring a lawyer to refrain from conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).

Lambarth failed to establish an estate checking account. He accumulated uncashed dividend checks, failed to respond to his clientsâ€™ repeated requests for information about the probate, and did not consult with an experienced probate attorney until May 1995, when he paid a probate attorney to complete the estate. In June 1996, the owners of a property management company hired Lambarth to evict a tenant from their low-income housing project. Lambarth filed a summons and complaint, but the court dismissed the case. Instead of informing his clients of the outcome, Lambarth filed a motion for reconsideration.

Eastonâ€™s suspension was based on his noncompliance with the terms of probation ordered by the Supreme Court of the State of Alaska in earlier disciplinary proceedings. Those proceedings were based on Eastonâ€™s failure to answer a grievance filed against him and failure to respond to bar counsel.Easton did not respond to the Washington State Supreme Courtâ€™s order issued pursuant to Rule 12.6 of the Rules for Lawyer Discipline, which directed him to inform the court of any claim that the imposition of identical discipline in this state would be unwarranted and, if so, the reasons therefor.

25.html,12426,Michael Tasker,,Suspension,12/21/2000,,"Michael K. Tasker (WSBA No.12426, admitted 1982), of Bellingham, was suspended for two years effective December 21, 2000, by order of the Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline is based on his misuse of client funds in his trust account in 1993 and 1994. For additional information, see the Supreme Court opinion published at 141 Wn.2d 557, 9 P.3d 822 (2000).In June 1992, Mr. Taskerâ€™s ex-wife obtained a $41,063.24 judgment against him for back-due child-support payments. The amount due increased later in 1992 to between $50,000 and $70,000. Mr. Taskerâ€™s business and personal accounts were garnished to pay his support obligation. From May 1993 through May 1994, Mr. Tasker allowed earned income to accumulate in his trust account. He paid all of his business and personal bills from this commingled account. Mr. Tasker admitted that the purpose of the commingling was to avoid garnishment of his personal and business funds by the Office of Support Enforcement. The hearing officer found that Mr. Tasker did not intend to permanently deprive his clients of any funds. The balance of the trust account sometimes fell below that attributable to client funds, but no client permanently lost funds. During this year, the trust account balance was up to $30,000 below what it should have been. On several occasions, the trust account was overdrawn, although no checks were returned. The hearing officer found that Mr. Tasker knew that he was using his clientsâ€™ funds to meet his personal financial obligations.The Court noted that during this time, Mr. Tasker suffered dramatic personal ""woes,"" including the dissolution of his law partnership and his marriage, loss of his mother, placement of his father in a nursing home, two automobile accidents with severe personal injuries, trial and retrial of a financially and emotionally draining murder case, and a change in primary residential placement of his children. The Court also noted that during the delay in prosecuting this case, Mr. Tasker remedied the problems with his trust account.Mr. Taskerâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.14, requiring lawyers to protect and account for clientâ€™s funds; 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; 1.5, requiring lawyers to provide accurate billings to clients; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed of the status of the matters; 1.7, requiring lawyers to avoid representing clients whose interests are directly adverse; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 3.3(a), prohibiting lawyers from knowingly making false statements of material fact to a tribunal; and 5.3, requiring lawyers to make reasonable efforts to supervise nonlawyer assistants.Joanne Abelson and Jean McElroy represented the Bar Association.

Blanchard (WSBA No. 12294, admitted 1982) has been ordered censured by the Disciplinary Board, which, on April 8, 1998, approved his stipulation for discipline. The discipline is based on Blanchardâ€™s four-month neglect of a child support modification matter, failure to communicate his clientâ€™s acceptance of a settlement offer, failure to communicate with his client, withdrawal of advanced fees from trust before they were earned, and failure to cooperate with the grievance investigation. Blanchard was also ordered to make restitution in the amount of $1,887.50.In April 1995, Blanchard was retained to represent a client seeking a post dissolution modification of child support. The client paid Blanchard $1,500 in advanced fees and costs. Following some initial investigation and attempts at negotiation, Blanchard failed to file any pleadings with the court, failed to actively pursue negotiations, failed to communicate his clientâ€™s acceptance of a settlement offer increasing child support from $150 to $425 per month, and failed to timely respond to his clientâ€™s requests for information. Blanchard also withdrew his clientâ€™s advanced fees from trust before they were earned, offsetting the deficit by giving his client a credit balance on trust account records and billing statements. Finally, Blanchard failed to respond to the Bar Associationâ€™s grievance investigation, requiring the Bar Association to serve Blanchard with a subpoena and deposition notice. Blanchardâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3 (diligence), RPC 3.2 (expediting litigation), RPC 1.2(a) (abiding by a clientâ€™s decision to accept an offer of settlement), RPC 1.4 (communicating with client), RPC 1.14 (preserving clientâ€™s property), and RLD 2.8 (respondent lawyerâ€™s duties in disciplinary investigation).Blanchard represented himself.

His failure to be admitted and to otherwise prosecute the case resulted in dismissal of the clientâ€™s case, which acted as an adjudication on the merits.

Charles Sprinkle (WSBA No. 16090, admitted 1986) of Libby, Montana, has been ordered suspended for six months, commencing May 19, 1998, by order of the Supreme Court of Washington. The Supreme Courtâ€™s order of reciprocal discipline, pursuant to Rule for Lawyer Discipline (RLD) 12.6, is based on the Montana Supreme Courtâ€™s February 3, 1998 order adopting the recommendation of the Montana Commission on Practice, and accepting the six-month suspension agreed to in Sprinkleâ€™s January 5, 1998 Affidavit of Consent.All relevant acts took place in Montana. Sprinkle was convicted of domestic abuse and disorderly conduct after entering pleas of guilty. The acts supporting these convictions occurred while he was the Lincoln County Attorney for the State of Montana. The acts involving the disorderly conduct conviction occurred while the deferred imposition of his sentence for the domestic abuse conviction was in effect. The disorderly conduct also resulted in personal injury to another person, and occurred while he was under the influence of alcohol.After pleading guilty to the disorderly conduct that caused physical injury to another person, the Montana District Court revoked the deferred imposition of Sprinkleâ€™s domestic abuse sentence. He was sentenced to a one-year suspended sentence on the condition that he resign the office of Lincoln County Attorney. As a result of these criminal convictions, he served 10 days in jail, paid a $1,000 fine, and was required to serve a year of supervised probation.Sprinkleâ€™s actions violated Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(b) (commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); and RPC 8.4(d) (engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).On March 2, 1998, the Washington State Bar Association (the ""Association"") provided the Washington Supreme Court with certified copies of the Montana Supreme Court Order imposing discipline on Sprinkle and his affidavit of consent, and asked the Court to issue an appropriate reciprocal discipline order pursuant to RLD 12.6.

The discipline is based upon neglect of two client matters and failure to cooperate with a WSBA disciplinary investigation.Matter 1. Mr. Weidenkopf represented defendants in a lawsuit. The trial date was set for June 10, 1996, and the clients instructed Mr. Weidenkopf to proceed to trial. On June 3, 1996, without notice to the clients, Mr. Weidenkopf filed motions to withdraw and continue the trial date. Mr. Weidenkopf argued to the court that he had a conflict of interest that would prevent him from going to trial, but would not prevent him from continuing settlement negotiations. He did not have a conflict of interest. The court granted the motion to withdraw, but denied the motion to continue the trial date. Mr. Weidenkopf did not notify his clients of his withdrawal or of the trial date. No one appeared for the clients at trial and the court entered a $275,056 judgment against them. Mr. Weidenkopfâ€™s conduct violated RPC 3.3(a), prohibiting knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to the tribunal; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and RPC 1.15(b), requiring a lawyer to follow appropriate procedure in withdrawing from a clientâ€™s case.Matter 2. Mr. Weidenkopf represented the husband in a dissolution action filed by the wife. The client told Mr. Weidenkopf that the wife was pregnant, but that he may not be the childâ€™s father. Mr. Weidenkopf did not raise this issue in pleadings or negotiations. Mr. Weidenkopf told the client that he did not need to appear for trial. No one appeared for the client at trial, and the court ordered that he pay child support. Mr. Weidenkopf signed the child support order and parenting plan ordered by the court. The client called to find out about the trial and to obtain copies of the final orders. Mr. Weidenkopf did not return many of the clientâ€™s calls and told him to get copies of the orders from the court file. The orders were not available from the court file for several months. Mr. Weidenkopfâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to clients; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; and RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.WSBA disciplinary counsel requested that Mr. Weidenkopf respond to three separate grievances. When Mr. Weidenkopf failed to respond within 30 days, disciplinary counsel notified him that his response was overdue and that a deposition would be scheduled if he failed to respond. Mr. Weidenkopf did not respond to the second letter and attempted to evade service of the subpoena. A WSBA investigator personally served Mr. Weidenkopf with a subpoena duces tecum for the deposition. The afternoon prior to the deposition, Mr. Weidenkopf faxed two letters to the WSBA requesting additional information and guidance about one of the matters. Disciplinary counsel left a phone message for Mr. Weidenkopf that afternoon, indicating that his appearance was still required. Mr. Weidenkopf did not appear at the deposition. He faxed a letter that morning stating that he could not attend the deposition due to severe allergies and extreme drowsiness caused by medication. Although Mr. Weidenkopf agreed to reschedule the deposition, he did not. The WSBA notified Mr. Weidenkopf that a new grievance had been opened against him for failure to cooperate in the disciplinary investigations. The WSBA personally served Mr. Weidenkopf a second time, and he again failed to appear for the deposition. The day prior to the deposition, Mr. Weidenkopf requested that he be excused from the deposition for medical reasons. Disciplinary counsel requested that Mr. Weidenkopf sign medical releases. He did not respond to this request. Mr. Weidenkopfâ€™s conduct violated RLD 2.8(a), requiring lawyers to promptly respond to any inquiry or request made pursuant to the RLDs for information relevant to grievances of matters under investigation concerning conduct of a lawyer.Mr. Weidenkopf represented himself.

Weerts (WSBA No. 13768, admitted 1983), formerly of Vancouver, Washington, has been ordered disbarred pursuant to a Stipulation to Disbarment, approved by the Supreme Court on February 25, 1998, and effective that date. The discipline is based upon his having abandoned his law practice, resulting in several grievances, and his misuse of client funds. Weerts closed his Vancouver, Washington law office in fall 1993, but did not advise several clients. The clients encountered substantial difficulties in locating Weerts over many months. He was suspended from the practice of law in Washington State in June 1994 for failure to pay his license fees. He continued to do legal work in two cases, however, and in one case he collected legal fees from the Washington client, although he knew he was suspended from the practice of law. In another case, in summer 1994, he erroneously believed that the clientâ€™s case was settled and advised the client to begin paying reduced support based on a change of custody. Later, a garnishment action was begun based on the existing support order that had never been modified. His failure to keep clients informed of his practice location violated RPC 1.4 (communication with clients). By failing to give his clients notice of his June 1994 suspension, he violated RLD 8.1 (notice to clients upon suspension). By continuing to represent the clients while knowing that he been suspended from practicing law, he violated RLD 8.2 (practicing law while suspended).In a separate personal injury case, Weerts failed to account for and deliver a clientâ€™s settlement funds which were owed to a medical provider. The case was settled in September 1993 for $16,500, and Weerts advised the client that he would pay $1780 to a medical provider. The settlement funds were deposited in trust, and disbursed as outlined in the settlement statement provided the client, except the medical bill was not paid. Instead, Weerts spent the funds initially withheld for the medical provider on personal obligations. His failure to pay or deliver to the client or the medical provider, as requested by the client, funds which they were entitled to receive, violated RPC 1.14 (b)(4) (prompt delivery to client or to third party of client funds) and RPC 8.4 (c) (dishonesty). In 1996, a civil judgment for economic and punitive damages was entered against Weerts on this claim.Weerts was suspended from the practice of law in Washington in 1994 for failure to pay Association license fees and to comply with continuing legal education (APR 11) requirements. He did not seek reinstatement to active status during these proceedings. In fall 1997, Weerts stipulated to disbarment and agreed to pay specific restitution to three clients and to pay any civil judgments entered against him by reason of the professional misconduct outlined in the stipulation. The Stipulation was approved by the Disciplinary Board in December 1997, and by the Supreme Court on February 25, 1998. Weerts represented himself.

262.html,17661,Charles Greenberg,,Reprimand,1/27/1998,,"Edmonds lawyer Charles M. Greenberg (WSBA No. 17661, admitted 1988) has been ordered reprimanded pursuant to a stipulation for discipline approved by the Disciplinary Board on January 27, 1998. The discipline is based on Greenbergâ€™s conduct involving misrepresentation to a client, in violation of RPC 8.4(c), and failure to reasonably assure his partnersâ€™ conformity to the Rules of Professional Conduct, in violation of RPC 5.1.Greenberg was a partner in one firm from March 1991 through April 1994, and had previously worked with partners Wade Dann and John Radder at another firm where Dann was a partner and Radder and Greenberg were associates. In 1990, while an associate at one firm, Greenberg changed initials on a Work in Progress (WIP) report at Dannâ€™s direction. While at the other firm, Greenberg instructed the bookkeeper to change the initials of an associate to his own, or delete the initials all together, on eight WIPs. This conduct violated RPC 8.4(c). In 1991, a client informed Dann that he would like a specific construction claimsâ€™ analyst employed by the firm to work on his matter. This analyst was not available, so a different analyst worked on the matter. Greenberg later learned that when it came time to bill the client, Dann instructed that the initials of the requested analyst be substituted for those of the analyst who actually worked on the matter.In February 1992, another client informed Dann that he no longer desired to have a particular analyst work on his matter. From February through June 1992, the analyst continued to work on the clientâ€™s matter and prepared law firm billing records that reflected this work. Dann and Radder altered those billing records by removing the analystâ€™s initials and substituting Radderâ€™s initials to conceal the fact that the analyst continued to work on the clientâ€™s matter. During the first half of 1992, Greenberg became generally aware of the ongoing initial-switching on client billings detailed above. Greenberg did not actively participate in the initial-switching activities of Dann and Radder. However, Greenberg did not report these activities to the Bar Association, nor did he voice his objections to the firm or take other action to stop or remedy the practice until some months after he learned of the practice. This conduct violated RPC 5.1. Greenbergâ€™s conduct is mitigated by several factors, which affected the sanction imposed. Respondent Greenberg represented himself. Disciplinary Counsel Sachia I.

Krilich (WSBA No. 2973, admitted 1967), of Tacoma, has been ordered reprimanded and placed on probation for three years, pursuant to a stipulation for discipline approved by the Disciplinary Board on January 27, 1998. The discipline is based on Krilichâ€™s failure to diligently pursue a clientâ€™s matter, in violation of RPC 1.3, and failure to keep the client informed of the status of the matter, in violation of RPC 1.4(a).In November 1993, Krilich agreed to represent a corporation in the collection of a judgment. He took some initial action shortly after being hired. The client made several attempts to reach him by phone in the first half of 1994. He did not answer or return the telephone calls. In May and June 1994, the client wrote him letters inquiring as to the status of his efforts to collect the judgment. In August 1994, he responded by letter to the clientâ€™s inquiries. In May and August 1995, the client sent registered letters to him requesting an update on his efforts to collect the judgment. Krilich failed to proceed against the debtor corporation and did not have any further communication with his client after his letter in August 1994.The discipline is based on the aggravating factor that Krilich received a reprimand and censure in 1994 for violations of RPC 1.3 and 1.4(a). The conduct is mitigated by the fact that the client suffered no actual injury, and any potential injury was remote and speculative. Krilich has been placed on a three-year period of probation during which he must meet with a practice monitor to ensure that he timely prosecutes client matters and keeps clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters.Brian A.

Lofton (WSBA No. 25893, admitted 1996) of Kirkland, Washington, has been ordered suspended for 60 days, commencing March 30, 1998, and ending May 29, 1998, by Order of the Supreme Court of Washington. The Supreme Courtâ€™s order of reciprocal discipline, pursuant to Rule for Lawyer Discipline (RLD) 12.6, is based on the Oregon Supreme Courtâ€™s August 12, 1997, Order approving a Stipulation for Discipline in which Lofton agreed to be suspended from the practice of law in Oregon for a period of 60 days, commencing September 1, 1997. Between 1992 and 1995, Lofton was employed as an associate or corporate counsel by Secure Benefits, Inc. (""Benefits""), formerly known as Security Benefits Inc., a for-profit corporation in the business of selling estate planning documents, investment and insurance services, and related products. Benefits was owned by a nonlawyer. During the course of his employment, Lofton provided legal advice and trained nonlawyers who gathered personal and financial information from individuals and marketed Benefitsâ€™ estate planning documents and services, forwarding payments therefor to Benefits. He also provided legal services and advice to many of the individuals who purchased the documents and services from Benefits, and was compensated therefor by Benefits. In one situation, after he began to prepare estate planning documents for certain clients of Benefits, the clients changed their minds and asked Benefits for a refund. Lofton represented Benefits against those clients in trying to reach a settlement of the fee dispute. The discipline was imposed for Loftonâ€™s stipulated violations of various disciplinary rules of the Oregon Code of Professional Responsibility. He violated DR 3-101(A) and DR 3-102(A) by aiding nonlawyers in the unauthorized practice of law and sharing legal fees with nonlawyers; DR 5-101(A) by failing to satisfy the conflict of interest full disclosure requirements of DR 10-101(B); DR 5-105(E) by representing multiple current clients with actual or likely conflicts of interest; and DR-105(C) by representing a client against a former client in the same or significantly related matter in which he had represented the former client. These violations occurred while Lofton practiced in Oregon, and before he was licensed to practice law in Washington state.On October 29, 1997, the Washington State Bar Association (the Association) provided the Washington Supreme Court with certified copies of the Oregon Supreme Court Order imposing discipline on Lofton and the Oregon Stipulation for Discipline, and asked the Court to issue an appropriate reciprocal discipline order pursuant to RLD 12.6. Thereafter, the issues were briefed. The Washington Supreme Court considered en banc the reciprocal discipline matter, denied Loftonâ€™s motion for oral argument, and imposed the reciprocal discipline.

267.html,14561,Biann-Sheng Tsui,,Reprimand,8/17/1997,,"Seattle lawyer Biann-Sheng Tsui (WSBA No. 14561, admitted 1984) has been ordered reprimanded by the Disciplinary Board, after approving a Stipulation, for his conduct in failing to maintain complete records of client funds, allowing trust account overdrafts and failing promptly to disburse settlement proceeds to a client.In November 1990, a WSBA auditor performed a random examination of Tsuiâ€™s pooled IOLTA client trust account pursuant to RLD 13.1(a). The auditor issued a report on April 3, 1991, finding that Tsui did not maintain complete records of client funds, commingled lawyer funds with client funds, was unable to identify the ownership of client funds, did not keep client ledgers and did not reconcile the bank statements to the check register balances, or reconcile individual client balances to the check register balance.Tsui subsequently opened a second law office and set up a second pooled IOLTA account. Tsuiâ€™s pooled IOLTA accounts were overdrawn twice, once in 1992 and once in 1994. In the course of the investigation of the 1994 overdraft, a WSBA auditor examined Tsuiâ€™s IOLTA accounts for the calendar year 1994. The auditor issued a final report which indicated problems similar to those found in 1990.On August 15, 1994, Tsuiâ€™s office received $12,000 in settlement funds on behalf of a client. That same day, Tsuiâ€™s assistant issued a check for $7,215 to the client representing her portion of the settlement. The assistant had the client sign an agreement with Tsuiâ€™s office stating that she would not cash the check without giving the office two weeksâ€™ prior notice in return for Tsuiâ€™s attempting to obtain a discount for her on her medical bills. This transaction effectively constituted a $7,215 loan from the client to Tsui. The client did not have a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel regarding this transaction. There were insufficient funds in the pooled IOLTA trust account for the client to cash her check when issued on August 15, 1994; if she had cashed it at that time, the trust account would have been short by $5,739.Tsuiâ€™s conduct in failing to keep complete records of client funds, in failing to maintain all client funds in a trust account, which resulted in payments or advances being made on behalf of one client from funds held for another client in the same pooled IOLTA account, in failing to withdraw attorneysâ€™ fees when earned, and in withdrawing funds from his pooled IOLTA account without clear evidence of entitlement to those funds, each violated RPC 1.14. Tsuiâ€™s failure to make reasonable efforts to ensure the conduct of his nonlawyer assistant was compatible with Tsuiâ€™s professional obligations, and Tsuiâ€™s permitting his staff to enter into a business transaction with a client without providing the client a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel, violated RPC 1.8(a) through a violation of RPC 5.3(b).Disciplinary Counsel Anne I.

268.html,12172,Dennis Ott,,Suspension,12/12/1997,,"Kelso lawyer Dennis G. Ott (WSBA No. 12172, admitted 1981) has been ordered suspended for 30 days by order of the Supreme Court effective December 12, 1997. The discipline is based upon Ottâ€™s having failed to transfer fees he had earned out of the pooled client trust account in a timely way; his transferring funds, which belonged to the client, from clientâ€™s trust account as fees; his use of client funds to pay a $250 Civil Rule 11 sanction imposed against him; his altering and recording a previously executed community property agreement; and, his tape recording a client conference without the clientsâ€™ knowledge or consent.Over the course of time, Ott was hired and paid by 12 clients to perform legal work. Money was collected from the clients for the legal work and deposited into the pooled client trust account. It remained there even after Ott completed the tasks and earned his fee for periods ranging from eight months (one count), nine months (five counts), 10 months (two counts), one year (one count), one year and seven months (one count), to six years and five months (one count). Ottâ€™s failure to transfer earned fees in a timely fashion violated RPC 1.14(a) (failure to withdraw funds belonging to lawyer promptly from client trust account).Ott was hired to probate an estate. Funds belonging to the estate were deposited into a client trust account. When the legal work was completed, Ott transferred his earned fees from the trust account, but then made a second transfer of funds. Within a month Ott discovered the second erroneous transfer and immediately returned the funds to the clientâ€™s account. Ottâ€™s negligent transfer of client funds into his general account violated RPC 1.14(a) (withdrawing client funds from a client trust account).Ott was hired by a client to defend the client in a boundary line dispute. After trial, Ott filed a motion requesting a continuance for the presentment of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Hearing on his motion was set for a date on which Ott was unavailable, so an associate appeared instead. At the hearing, the judge denied the motion, ruled that Ott was deliberately trying to delay the proceedings, and imposed a $250 Civil Rule 11 sanction against Ott personally. Although the associate did not clearly indicate to Ott that the sanction was imposed personally against Ott, the written court order was specific that the sanction was imposed against Ott. Instead of using his own funds, Ott issued a check for the $250 from his clientâ€™s trust funds, without the clientâ€™s consent, to pay the sanction, which violated RPC 1.14(a) (withdrawing client funds from a client trust account). Ott prepared a community property agreement for clients who executed it in March 1990. The husband died in April 1994, and the wife died in May 1994. The coupleâ€™s heirs hired Ott to probate the estate. During the course of the probate, Ott directed a member of his staff to prepare a new first page for the community property agreement, which deleted a paragraph, and substitute the new page for the original page. After the alteration, Ott recorded, or caused to be recorded, the altered agreement in the county auditorâ€™s office. By directing his employee to alter the community property agreement, Ott violated RPC 5.3(c)(1) (a lawyer is responsible for conduct of a nonlawyer employee that would be a violation of RPCs if engaged in by the lawyer) and RPC 8.4(c) (dishonest conduct). By recording, or causing to be recorded, the altered community property agreement, Ott violated RPC 4.1(a) (knowingly making a false statement) and RPC 8.4(d) (conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).Without the clientsâ€™ knowledge or permission, Ott made a tape recording of his conference with the clients. Ottâ€™s making such a recording was contrary to RCW 9.73.030, which violated RPC 8.4(b) (committing a criminal act that adversely reflects on a lawyerâ€™s honesty), and also violated RPC 8.4(c) (dishonest conduct).The hearing officer was C.

The disbarment, which was pursuant to a stipulation, was based on Sandmeyer's conviction of one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud.On May 17, 1994, Sandmeyer pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud. Sandmeyer and the United States executed a Factual Basis for Guilty Plea, which stated that Sandmeyer agreed to act as a figurehead at a law office controlled by nonlawyers who set up the office to generate false and fraudulent claims and thereby obtain insurance benefits. The Factual Basis for Guilty Plea also stated that Sandmeyer deliberately avoided knowing the full scope of the nonlawyers' scheme.The parties stipulated that Sandmeyer's conduct violated Rules 1.1 (a) (act involving moral turpitude, dishonesty or corruption), l.l(c) (violation of oath), l.l(o) (assisting another in committing act prohibited by rules) and 1.1 (p) (conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice) of the Rules for Lawyer Discipline.The Hearing Officer was Randy M.

270.html,21239,Robert Hayes,,Reprimand,1/26/1998,,"Tacoma lawyer Robert L. Hayes (WSBA No. 21239, admitted 1991) has been ordered to receive two reprimands and probation by the Disciplinary Board, which on January 26, 1998, approved his stipulation. The discipline is based on Hayesâ€™ making unsubstantiated allegations concerning a Superior Court commissionerâ€™s integrity in violation of RPC 8.2(a) and his failure to represent clients diligently and competently in four separate matters. In one matter, Hayes was hired in November 1992 to obtain an antiharassment order. He filed a petition for an order for protection without his clientâ€™s signature or verification, as required by RCW 10.14. The petition was based solely on hearsay and was facially deficient. The commissioner dismissed the petition and ordered sanctions against Hayes. Hayes filed an objection to the award of sanctions. In his objection, Hayes alleged that the commissionerâ€™s ruling was biased because he was a friend of the opposing counsel. The commissioner and opposing counsel were not friends, and the allegation was not supported by credible evidence. Hayesâ€™ actions violated RPC 8.2(a) which prohibits a lawyer from making statements about the integrity of an adjudicatory officer with reckless disregard as to their truth or falsity.In a second matter, Hayes was hired in March 1992 to represent a client in a breach of contract action. The contract did not contain a provision for attorneysâ€™ fees, but the client could have sought statutory attorneysâ€™ fees. Hayes did not research the issue of recovering statutory attorneysâ€™ fees and never sought statutory attorneysâ€™ fees. Hayes received an offer of settlement from the opposing party but did not immediately relay the offer to his client. By the time Hayes discussed the issue of submitting an offer of settlement with his client, the statutory deadline for submitting offers of settlement had expired. In a third matter, Hayes was hired in February 1993 to represent a client in a defamation and discrimination lawsuit. During his clientâ€™s deposition, Hayes improperly made frivolous objections. Hayes permitted his client to prepare and file pleadings, including a response to summary judgment and Hayesâ€™ own declaration, without adequately reviewing the pleadings. The pleadings were garbled and incoherent, and the court granted summary judgment to the opposing party.In a fourth matter, Hayes was hired in August 1993 to represent a client in a marital dissolution. After reaching a settlement, opposing counsel set a hearing for the presentation of the final dissolution orders. Hayesâ€™ client told Hayes that he strongly objected to the proposed order for the division of property because the personal property to be awarded to him was not specifically identified and listed in the order. Hayes failed to attend the hearing on behalf of his client to contest the opposing counselâ€™s proposed dissolution orders, and the proposed orders were entered. Hayes moved for reconsideration of the entry of the orders. The court denied the motion and sanctioned Hayesâ€™ client. Hayesâ€™ client paid for the sanctions, even though the sanctions were based solely on Hayesâ€™ failure to appear at the hearing to oppose the entry of the dissolution orders. Hayesâ€™ client did not receive personal property, worth about $5,000, which was not listed in the division of property order. Hayesâ€™ failure to diligently and competently represent his clients in the above-described four matters violated RPC 1.1 (requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation) and RPC 1.3 (requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence).Respondent was represented by Leland G. Ripley.

271.html,14640,Dennis Sullivan,,Reprimand,12/10/1997,,"Seattle lawyer Dennis Sullivan (WSBA No. 14640, admitted 1984) has been ordered to receive two reprimands and probation by the Disciplinary Board, which on December 10, 1997, approved his stipulation to discipline. The discipline is based on his failure to deposit unearned fee advances into a trust account and promptly deliver unearned advance deposits to his client. In addition, he failed to diligently represent clients and keep them reasonably informed in two separate matters.In the first matter, Sullivan was hired in August 1993 to commence a collection lawsuit. He received a $750 advance-fee deposit, which he deposited into his firmâ€™s general account instead of into a trust account as required by RPC 1.14. In February 1994, the same client re-hired Sullivan to commence and conduct supplemental proceedings to satisfy a judgment. The unearned advance-fee deposit from the previous lawsuit was to be used to finance the supplemental proceedings. Sullivan failed to pursue the supplemental proceedings for over three months. He finally drafted a motion and declaration for supplemental proceedings, but he did not appear on time at the supplemental proceedings, did not reschedule them, and did not keep his client informed about its status. Sullivan did not refund the unearned fees, despite a request from his client.In another matter, Sullivan was hired in November 1995 to represent a client in a marital dissolution. Sullivan failed to timely file and disclose to opposing counsel the list of primary witnesses. As a result, the client incurred additional legal expenses. On September 18, 1996, Sullivan and his client participated in a mediation resulting in a settlement of various issues. The mediator sent a letter to the lawyers for both parties setting forth the substance of the settlement. After receiving the letter, Sullivan drafted and signed a Notice of Settlement to approve the settlement terms in the mediatorâ€™s letter, believing that the letter accurately reflected the substance of the settlement. Before disclosing the letter to his client, Sullivan filed and served the Notice of Settlement with the court and opposing counsel. After the Notice of Settlement was filed, the client received the mediatorâ€™s letter from Sullivan. The client, believing that the letter did not accurately reflect the substance of the settlement, fired Sullivan and hired new legal counsel. Sullivanâ€™s actions in filing a Notice of Settlement was detrimental to the clientâ€™s attempt to persuade the court that the mediatorâ€™s settlement letter did not accurately reflect the settlement.Sullivanâ€™s actions violated RPC 1.14 (trust account rules), RPC 1.3 (duty of diligence), RPC 1.4 (duty to keep the client in the two matters reasonably informed), and RPC 1.2 (duty to abide by clientâ€™s decisions regarding settlement).Sullivan represented himself.

The discipline is based upon Turcotteâ€™s violation of RPC 1.3, RPC 1.4, and RPC 8.4(c) in five separate matters.In one matter, Turcotte was hired in August 1995 to represent a client in a lawsuit. He filed a summons and complaint on behalf of his client but failed to hire a process server to effectuate personal service on the defendant. Turcotte misrepresented to his client on two occasions that service of process had been effectuated on the defendant when it had not. In a second matter, Turcotte was hired in May 1996 to commence foreclosure on a note and deed of trust. Turcotte obtained summary judgment on his clientâ€™s note and deed of trust. He took no further action to schedule and proceed with a sheriffâ€™s sale on the subject property. He misrepresented to his client that the sheriffâ€™s sale was completed when it was not. Turcotte misrepresented the delay of the sheriffâ€™s sale to his client on two more occasions. In a third matter, a lawyer hired Turcotte in May 1996 to assist as co-counsel in a matter involving an appeal of a permit denial. The lawyer directed Turcotte to schedule a hearing for the appeal, but Turcotte never scheduled the hearing. Turcotte misrepresented to the lawyer that he had scheduled the hearing.In a fourth matter, Turcotte was hired in May 1996 to commence probate proceedings. He never commenced probate proceedings and failed to safekeep the original will and vehicle title. Turcotte misrepresented to his client that the probate proceedings had been commenced. In a fifth matter, Turcotte was assigned by other lawyers at his law firm to handle the witnessing of a clientâ€™s will in July 1996. He failed to obtain the attestation of the witnesses for the will. In November 1996, Turcotte left the law firm where he practiced and never followed up on the firmâ€™s request that he obtain attestation.Turcotteâ€™s conduct in these five matters violated RPC 1.3 (lack of diligence), RPC 1.4 (failure to keep client reasonably informed), and RPC 8.4(c) (conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation).Respondent represented himself.

Dale Jurdy (WSBA No. 16030, admitted 1986) has been ordered censured by the Disciplinary Board, pursuant to a stipulation to discipline, approved by the Disciplinary Board August 19, 1997. The discipline is based on neglect of a clientâ€™s matter regarding residential placement of children. In mid-August 1992, the clientâ€™s ex-husband, a Spokane resident, refused to return their two children to the care of the client, who resided near Olympia, at the conclusion of the childrenâ€™s summer visitation. The ex-husband instead petitioned the Spokane Superior Court for primary residential placement (custody) of the children. The court ordered temporary placement of one child with the ex-husband, ordered an immediate visit between that child and the client, ordered immediate return of the other child to the clientâ€™s care, and appointed a Guardian ad Litem (GAL) to prepare a report regarding appropriate residential placement. With the assistance of another lawyer, the client successfully petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to obtain release of the children from the father. After visitation with the one child, that child was returned to the ex-husband pursuant to the courtâ€™s order for temporary placement. On September 28, 1992, the client hired Jurdy (and delivered a $1,000 advance-fee deposit) to represent her in defending against the ex-husbandâ€™s petition for placement of the children with him and to bring a contempt motion to recoup the costs of the habeas corpus proceeding. The client was concerned that the ex-husbandâ€™s recent deep involvement in a fundamental religious faith, and his incessant phoning of the children when in her care, was leading to a sort of ""programming"" of the children against their mother, who was not of that faith. The client therefore specifically requested that Jurdy subpoena the ex-husbandâ€™s telephone records and that he speak to one or more of the religious-influence experts she had located, about the possibility of providing expert testimony at hearing. The client terminated Jurdyâ€™s services July 29, 1993. A hearing had never been held nor a GAL report ever filed. During the period of representation, Jurdy did not bring a contempt motion, did not attempt to subpoena or request production of the ex-husbandâ€™s phone records, did not conduct any formal discovery, did not investigate or gather information to defend against the ex-husbandâ€™s petition (except to write one letter to the childrenâ€™s school principal), did not advise the client that delay in bringing her case to hearing would adversely impact her position, did not take action to compel preparation of the GAL report or bring the GALâ€™s delay to the courtâ€™s attention, did not note the case for trial, and did not take steps to resolve the case without hearing. In addition, Jurdy did not return numerous phone calls from the client and did not attend office appointments with the client. After the representation was terminated, Jurdy removed the $1,000 advance-fee deposit from his trust account and paid it to himself as fees, although he had never provided an accounting of time or costs or the method of calculating his fee to the client. By failing to communicate with, and advise, the client, Jurdy violated RPC 1.2(a), 1.3, and 1.4. By failing to investigate or develop the clientâ€™s case or bring it before the court, Jurdy violated RPC 1.3. By failing to timely account for the clientâ€™s advance fee deposit or provide the manner of calculating his fee and by failing to remove fees from his client trust account as earned, Jurdy violated RPC 1.14. Jurdy will pay restitution to the client of $1,000 plus interest from January 1, 1994.

Engle (WSBA No. 21935, admitted 1992) has been ordered censured by the Disciplinary Board, pursuant to a stipulation to discipline, approved by the Disciplinary Board August 19, 1997. The discipline is based on improper withdrawal from representation in a clientâ€™s child support modification matter and on failure to prepare, or to properly supervise the clientâ€™s lawyer, in preparing her case for trial. The firm of Hessinger & Associates employed Engle as its managing lawyer. The firm represented the client in seeking a decrease in her child support obligation. The court issued an order setting case schedule when the firm filed the action. The order set trial by affidavit for January 13, 1995, discovery cut-off at December 23, 1994, and affidavit filing deadline at December 30, 1994. Separate contempt proceedings regarding nonpayment of support arose between the client and her ex-husband in November 1994, and the court set a review hearing in that matter for March 13, 1995. On December 2, 1994, the lawyer assigned to the client gave notice of his intention to leave the firmâ€™s employment on December 17, 1994. During the two weeks before his departure, he did not take steps to prepare the affidavits or otherwise prepare the clientâ€™s case for trial. When the lawyer left the firm, a notice of substitution of counsel was not filed; the lawyer thus remained counsel of record in the clientâ€™s case. (That lawyerâ€™s actions were the subject of separate disciplinary inquiry.) The clientâ€™s file was given to another lawyer in the firm who directed the file be taken to Engle because that lawyer indicated he could not handle the case. Engle reviewed the clientâ€™s file and decided the firm should withdraw from representation. Staff drafted a notice of intent to withdraw, with a signature line for the counsel of record. On December 28, 1994, Engle signed the notice ""David S. Engle WSBA 21935 for"" just above the printed name of the counsel of record. The counsel of record did not know about, consent to, or authorize use of his name in a notice of intent to withdraw. Engle filed the notice December 29, 1994. The notice indicated an effective date of January 10, 1995, and a next court date as a review hearing on March 13, 1995. The firm and its employees took no further action on behalf of the client. The client contacted Engle on January 12, 1995, and early on January 13, 1995, to request his assistance with her trial on January 13, 1995. Engle had an assistant call the court to inquire whether there was a trial set, but the assistant called the wrong department and thus failed to verify there was a trial. Engle did not believe the client had a trial on January 13, 1995, and did nothing further. The clientâ€™s trial occurred on January 13, 1995, with the client appearing, unrepresented and unprepared. At the conclusion of the trial, the court dismissed the clientâ€™s petition and imposed $750 in attorney fees because, the court found, she had not presented any grounds for modification, and the petition was not brought in good faith. By causing a withdrawal from the clientâ€™s case effective three days before trial, without taking steps to protect her ability to properly present the case at trial, Engle violated RPC 1.15(b) & (d). By failing to prepare or to assure that someone else prepared the clientâ€™s case for trial, Engle violated RPC 1.3 and/or 5.1.

279.html,19293,Theresa Gibbons,,Censure,8/1/1997,,"Seattle lawyer Theresa Jean Gibbons, formerly known as Theresa Gibbons Odom (WSBA No. 19293, admitted 1990), has been ordered censured pursuant to a stipulation for discipline, approved by the Disciplinary Board in August 1997. The discipline is based upon a misrepresentation made by Gibbons when submitting materials for publication in the Judicial Voters Pamphlet for the fall 1996 judicial elections. Gibbons was an unsuccessful candidate for King County Superior Court judge in the fall 1996 elections. The Office of the Administrator of the Courts (OAC) had the responsibility of publishing a Judicial Voters Pamphlet for the fall 1996 judicial elections. The deadline for submitting materials to OAC for publication in the voters pamphlet was 1 p.m. on Friday August 9, 1996, and all candidates were informed of that deadline. Any materials postmarked before August 9, 1996, and received by OAC by August 12, 1996, would also be timely. On August 9, Gibbons called and told OAC that her materials had been mailed but returned to her because she had left off OACâ€™s post office box number. She was told that if she could not get the materials to OAC by 1 p.m. that day, the materials might still be accepted if she submitted the returned envelope intact by August 12, with the candidate information inside and the August 8 postmark on the envelope. On August 12, 1996, Gibbons delivered her materials to OAC inside an envelope bearing an August 8, 1996, postmark. The envelope had been used by a third party to mail something to Gibbons, and Gibbons had placed new mailing labels over the original recipient and sender addresses. Gibbons knew that she had not used the envelope to mail her materials to OAC. When Gibbons was told that her materials were late and would not be accepted, she stated that she had called on the 9th, and she pointed out the August 8 postmark on the envelope. OAC accepted the materials. The materials were not published in the voters pamphlet, however, because OAC subsequently determined that Gibbons had not used the envelope to mail materials to OAC, but instead a third party had used it to mail items to Gibbons, and it bore that third partyâ€™s postage meter stamp. Given Gibbonsâ€™ knowledge of the importance of the postmark date, her use of an envelope with an August 8 postmark date and her actions in indicating that postmark when she hand-delivered the materials on August 12 were a misrepresentation about whether her materials were being submitted within the deadline for inclusion in the Judicial Voters Pamphlet. These actions violated RPC 8.4(c), which prohibits lawyers from engaging in conduct involving misrepresentation, and subject Gibbons to discipline pursuant to RLD 1.1(a) and RLD 1.1 (I).

The Court also ordered the suspension be followed by two years of probation, during which he must comply with his criminal probation. The discipline is based upon his 1994 conviction in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington on three felony counts of distribution of cocaine.On three separate occasions, Kappelman arranged to purchase cocaine from an undercover informant. Kappelman was arrested on August 17, 1994. On September 19, 1994, he pleaded guilty to three felony counts of distribution of cocaine to his wife. Based upon Kappelmanâ€™s conviction, and pursuant to RLD 3.1, on October 6, 1994, the Washington Supreme Court entered an interim order of suspending Kappelman from the practice of law pending the final outcome of disciplinary proceedings.After a two-day disciplinary hearing in January 1996, the Hearing Officer recommended dismissal of the disciplinary charges. On appeal by the Association, the Disciplinary Board ordered the Hearing Officerâ€™s Findings, Conclusions and Recommendation stricken and adopted its own. The Board concluded Kappelmanâ€™s conduct violated RLD 1.1(a) (disregard for the rule of law) and RLD 1.1(c) (violation of lawyerâ€™s oath) and recommended a sanction of two year suspension from practice.

Graettinger (WSBA No. 14975, admitted 1985), formerly of Wenatchee, has been disbarred pursuant to a stipulation for discipline approved by the Supreme Court effective September 11, 1998. In the stipulation, Mr. Graettinger admitted he had knowingly forged the signature of a U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge.In October 1997, the United States Attorneyâ€™s Office filed a one-count information in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Washington charging Graettinger with the felony crime of forging a Federal Judicial Officerâ€™s signature, 18 U.S.C. Â§505. He pled guilty and was sentenced to three yearsâ€™ probation, 150 hours of community service, and agreed to pay $5,448 in restitution to certain persons. In the stipulation, Graettinger also admitted that he had deceived clients about the status of their cases; had created fictitious documents containing forged signatures and/or the letterhead of a Bankruptcy Judge, a Superior Court Judge, a Superior Court Commissioner, an opposing party and an opposing counsel; and that he had failed to diligently pursue clientsâ€™ cases.Graettinger stipulated that the Bar Association had sufficient evidence to meet its burden of proving by a clear preponderance that his conduct violated RPC 1.3 (lack of reasonable diligence); RPC 1.4 (duty to keep client reasonably informed); RPC 8.4(b), which prohibits a lawyer from engaging in a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty or trustworthiness; RPC 8.4(c), which prohibits a lawyer from engaging in acts involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice); and RLD 1.1(a), which prohibits a lawyer from committing acts which involve moral turpitude or which reflect disregard for the rule of law.

Dann (WSBA No. 7552, admitted 1973), of Seattle and Bellingham, has been suspended from the practice of law for one year following a Supreme Court opinion issued August 13, 1998. The discipline is based upon Dannâ€™s misrepresentation to four different clients concerning which lawyers and firm employees worked on their cases. In 1990, while a partner at Ulin, Dann and Lambe, Dann switched his initials on billing statements for those of an associate and claimed the associateâ€™s work as his own on two different cases. Dann justified his actions by claiming that he had reviewed the associateâ€™s work or had done similar work, and was saving the clients money by deleting the associateâ€™s time. He had no contemporaneous time records supporting that he had done any work on these cases.In 1992, while a partner at Dann Greenberg Radder, Dann switched the initials of paraprofessionals who had worked on two different cases so that the clients were misled as to who had performed the work. In one instance, a client asked that a particular paraprofessional work on his case, but the requested person was unavailable and another paraprofessional worked on the case. Dann switched the initials on the billing statements so it appeared that the person the client had requested work on the case in fact did so. In a second instance, a client asked that a particular paraprofessional not work on his case. Dann believed that that paraprofessional was the most qualified to do the work, and placed that person on the case. He switched the initials on the billing statements so it appeared that the work had been performed by one of the firmâ€™s partners. Dannâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(c), which prohibits dishonest conduct. Kurt Bulmer represented Dann at the hearing, and with David Swartling before the Supreme Court.

By order of the State Bar Court of the State Bar of California filed on April 15, 1998, Brown was suspended from the practice of law for five years, execution stayed, and placed on probation for five years on conditions that he be actually suspended from the practice of law for one year and until he makes certain restitution. Brown stipulated to the disposition and to findings that he was convicted of one count of felony spousal battery, that he was convicted of four felony counts for the unauthorized practice of law, that he shared legal fees with a person not licensed to practice law, that he failed to competently perform legal services for several clients, and that he failed to provide clients with accountings of attorneys fees and of settlement proceeds.Brown did not respond to the Washington State Supreme Courtâ€™s order issued pursuant to Rule 12.6 of the Rules for Lawyer Discipline, which directed him to inform the court of any claim that the imposition of identical discipline in this state would be unwarranted and, if so, the reasons therefore.

By order of the Supreme Court of the State of Oregon dated June 26, 1997, Schaffner received a two-year suspension from the practice of law in Oregon.

Marshall (WSBA No. 15830, admitted 1986), of Seattle, has been reprimanded pursuant to the Disciplinary Boardâ€™s March 27, 1997 order, entered after a disciplinary hearing. The discipline is based upon Marshallâ€™s handling of a case in which he instructed a member of his office staff to sign two declarations without the declarantsâ€™ permission and to emulate the declarantsâ€™ signatures. Without making any notation that the declarants had not signed these declarations, Marshall filed these declarations with the court. These actions violated RPC 3.3 (a)(1) and (a)(4), RPC 4.1 (a), RPC 5.3, and RPC 8.4 (a), (c), and (d).Marshallâ€™s clientâ€™s case had been dismissed on a summary judgment motion in part because declarations submitted by the client and another witness were not in the proper form. Marshall had his staff prepare amended declarations for his client and the witness, so the declarations would meet the requirements of Civil Rule 56, but did not change the substance of two declarations previously signed by the declarants. He later instructed his staff to sign the two declarations and to emulate the signatures of his client and the witness. He knowingly filed the declarations with the false signatures in support of a motion for reconsideration of an order. There were no notations on the declarations to indicate that the declarants had not signed them, and Marshall did not inform opposing counsel or the judge that the declarants had not signed the declarations. Although Marshall directed his staff to improperly sign declarations, he would not accept personal responsibility for the improper signatures or submitting false information to the court.The Hearing Officer was C.

The discipline is based upon his filing a frivolous claim and failing to promptly comply with lawful discovery requests in 1996. (Note: Richard L. Jones is to be distinguished from Richard A. Jones of Seattle; Richard B. Jones of Port Orchard; and Richard F. Jones of Olympia.)In 1996, Mr. Jones represented a client in a civil lawsuit. The suit alleged that the client had stolen an exotic sports car from the plaintiff. The court set trial for April 29, 1996. At the clientâ€™s request, Mr. Jones asked that his clientâ€™s deposition be postponed until April 1. After business hours on March 29, the client notified Mr. Jones that he had been injured and could not appear for the deposition. Mr. Jones did not notify opposing counsel until counsel appeared for the deposition, and did not bring any of the subpoenaed documents.On April 10, 1996, opposing counsel obtained a court order compelling the client to make himself available for deposition immediately. Opposing counsel then rescheduled the deposition for April 15. The client appeared for the deposition and testified that a lawyer in Oregon had additional documents. Opposing counsel did not receive these additional documents until April 25. During the deposition, Mr. Jones instructed his client not to answer several questions and left the room to confer with his client while a question was pending, in violation of Civil Rules 30 (h)(3) and 30 (h)(5).On April 15, 1996, at the clientâ€™s request, Mr. Jones filed an answer, counterclaim and third-party complaint naming opposing counsel and his wife. The third-party complaint alleged abuse of process and Consumer Protection Act violations. The court dismissed the complaint and sanctioned Mr. Jones and the client for filing frivolous claims and failing to comply with discovery rules. Mr. Jones appealed the sanctions.

290.html,9053,Patrick Flannigan,,Disbarment,6/24/1997,,"Island County lawyer Patrick Joseph Flannigan (WSBA #9053, admitted 1979) was disbarred by the Washington Supreme Court effective June 24, 1997. Flannigan also was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $103,436.23, pursuant to RLD 5.3, and costs and expenses in the amount of $6,759.41, pursuant to RLD 5.7. The Order of Disbarment was entered after a default hearing and was based upon the hearing officerâ€™s findings and conclusions that Flannigan committed 24 counts of ethical misconduct. The hearing officerâ€™s recommendations of disbarment and restitution were approved by the Disciplinary Board. The discipline is based upon Flanniganâ€™s continued practice of law while suspended, neglect of seven client matters, misrepresentation to clients about the status of their cases, entering into business dealings with an elderly client, misappropriation of a clientâ€™s retirement funds held in trust, and abandonment of his practice without proper protection for his clients. Flannigan was suspended for nonpayment of dues on June 2, 1995. In 1995, prior to his suspension, Flannigan accepted funds from five clients but did not complete routine probate, trust and real estate legal services. After October 1995, Flannigan failed to return calls or keep his clients apprised of the status of their cases. In another matter, a trust of $99,352.52 was established with Flannigan as trustee, for the benefit and retirement of an older woman. Flannigan repeatedly violated the terms of the trust by invading the trust principal without prior authorization of the trustor. Within months, he made unauthorized loans to himself in the amount of $22,575.65. Flannigan did not keep accurate records and made misrepresentations to hide these disbursals. The beneficiary of the trust was injured by the removal of funds from her trust account. Flannigan left the beneficiary without any trustee for the trust, without an accounting of the trustâ€™s monies, and without documentation to establish or allow collection of outstanding loans from the trustâ€™s funds. After failing to pay his annual lawyer licensing fees, Flannigan accepted at least $15,000 in fees from three different clients. After his suspension, he failed to inform existing clients of his suspension and continued to accept legal fees and promise legal services until December 22, 1995, when he disappeared. He abandoned his practice without taking steps to protect any of his clientsâ€™ interests and leaving 22 boxes of client files behind. RLD 8.6 custodians were appointed to disburse 121 active client files and review over 15 boxes of closed files to remove and return to clients their original documents.

He was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $9,801.50, pursuant to RLD 5.3, and costs and expenses in the amount of $1,918.82, pursuant to RLD 5.7. The Order of Disbarment was entered after a default hearing and was based upon the Hearing Officerâ€™s Findings and Conclusions that Fornero committed 22 counts of ethical misconduct. The Disciplinary Board approved the Hearing Officerâ€™s recommendation of disbarment and restitution. The discipline is based upon findings that Fornero lacked competence (RPC 1.1), failed to abide by clientsâ€™ decisions regarding the scope of representation (RPC 1.2), continued to neglect eight client matters (RPC 1.3), failed to comply with his clientsâ€™ reasonable requests for information (RPC 1.4), failed to withdraw or return unearned fees (RPC 1.15), and his misrepresentation to clients about the status of their cases (RPC 8.4(c)).

Jones (WSBA No. 12904, admitted 1982), of Bellevue, received a censure on June 10, 2002, following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board on May 8, 2002. This discipline is based upon his failure to maintain adequate records regarding client funds coming into his possession, and the commingling of his personal funds with client funds in his trust account in 2000. (Note: Richard L. Jones is to be distinguished from Richard A. Jones of Seattle, WSBA No. 7671; Richard B. Jones of Port Orchard, WSBA No. 4613; and Richard F. Jones of Olympia, WSBA No. 1460.)On or about December 7, 2000, Mr. Jonesâ€™ IOLTA account became overdrawn, resulting in a notice to the Bar Association. In the course of the investigation, the auditor examined Mr. Jonesâ€™ records for the timeframe January 1998 to March 2001. In January 1998, Mr. Jonesâ€™ trust account was with Wells Fargo. In March 2000, he closed the Wells Fargo account and opened a Key Bank account. In November 2000, he opened a First Mutual account, but did not close the Key Bank account until March 2001.The auditor found that the manual check register for the Wells Fargo account was missing some transactions, manual deposit books were missing some deposit slips, and manual check registers and deposit books were not reconciled to monthly bank statements or client ledgers. Mr. Jonesâ€™ bookkeeper maintained a check register in QuickBooks; however, no client accounts were maintained in the QuickBooks records, thus Mr. Jones was unable to produce client ledgers. The QuickBooks registers were not reconciled to the bank statements until the end of 2000, and because of undetected errors, the QuickBooks registers and the manual registers did not agree.Client ledgers were kept in Timeslips; however, not all clients were included. The Timeslips system was not reconciled to either the manual check register or the QuickBooks register. Mr. Jones used Timeslips to estimate client balances prior to disbursements by manually comparing the most recent Timeslips billing with the manual check register and deposit books, which resulted in disbursing more funds than some clients had. Statements for the accounts were maintained but were not used to reconcile the accounts.This recordkeeping system resulted in trust account shortages without Mr. Jonesâ€™ knowledge. As of February 2001, the account balance was $3,351.45 less than it should have been, a shortage that had developed over a period of time. The auditor could not specifically identify the transactions that caused the shortage. Mr. Jones learned of the shortage from the overdraft notice; however, he was unable to determine the exact amount. After the auditorâ€™s determination, Mr. Jones restored the shortage in February 2001.Mr. Jonesâ€™ conduct violated RPCs 1.14(a), requiring lawyers to keep client funds in a trust account; and 1.14(b)(3), requiring lawyers to maintain complete records of client funds in their possession.Randy Beitel represented the Bar Association.

Between October 1993 and April 1995, she retained for herself approximately $20,000 in funds paid to her by 17 of the firmâ€™s clients, and deposited those funds in her personal bank account.

On May 27, 1998, the Superior Court of CNMI denied Oâ€™Sheaâ€™s motion to set aside the judgment of disbarment. The Washington Supreme Court considered en banc Oâ€™Sheaâ€™s request that the reciprocal proceedings be further placed on hold to allow an appeal to the Supreme Court of CNMI.

Mr. Hatch was the billing lawyer for clients in both a litigation and a bankruptcy matter. Mr. Hatch and another lawyer from his firm discussed with the clients the possibility of securing the firmâ€™s fees. Mr. Hatch mailed the clients an assignment of a deed of trust and a UCC financing statement to secure Mr. Hatchâ€™s firmâ€™s fees. The clients did not sign or return these documents. Later, Mr. Hatch briefly discussed a lien on the clientsâ€™ three-and-one-half-acre property to secure the firmâ€™s fees. In the minutes prior to a settlement conference, Mr. Hatch presented to the clients a deed of trust assignment and financing statement for the three-and-one-half acres. The clients testified that when they had questions about the amount of fees to be covered and the interest rate, they were told to sign the documents before they went to the settlement conference. They signed the documents. The clients retained subsequent counsel to set aside the deed of trust. The hearing officer found that Mr. Hatch believed that he had cleared the idea of the deed of trust with the clients in the earlier telephone conversation.By presenting the deed and security documents to the clients just prior to the settlement conference, Mr. Hatch prevented them from obtaining independent legal advice on this adverse business transaction, as required by RPC 1.8.The hearing officer was Jack Rosenow.

This discipline is based on Mr. Athertonâ€™s failure to diligently represent two clients and failure to keep the same two clients informed about the status of their cases.In 1994, Mr. Atherton represented an out-of-state client in a child support modification action. On November 7, 1994, Mr. Atherton notified the client that a hearing was scheduled that day. Later that day, Mr. Atherton told the client that the clientâ€™s child support had been retroactively increased and the final hearing had been continued to December 15. The client asked for copies of the orders, but never received them.Mr. Atherton failed to attend two status conferences and filed no pleadings after November 1994. On March 6, 1995, the court entered an order of default against Mr. Athertonâ€™s client. The Commissioner noted on the order that if the client filed a response and paid opposing counsel $750.00 prior to 9 a.m. March 13, 1995, the default order would be vacated. Mr. Atherton never told his client about this order. On March 15 the Parenting Plan was entered and on April 18, the Order of Child Support was filed.In March 1995, the client retained new counsel and discovered that terms/fees had been assessed against him on October 19, 1994 and that consideration of his pleadings at the November 17 hearing was conditioned on his prior payment of those terms/fees. He also learned of the default order, Parenting Plan and Order of Child Support. The clientâ€™s new counsel was able to vacate the default and other orders, except for the Parenting Plan and attorneysâ€™ fees. The parties reached agreement and the case settled.The client filed a malpractice action against Mr. Atherton in June 1997. The client obtained a default judgment that has not yet been paid.In the second grievance, also in 1994, Mr. Atherton represented a client in a dissolution. Temporary orders were filed in April 1994. After July 1994, Mr. Atherton failed to perform any work on the clientâ€™s case. On October 19, 1994, the court entered an order of default. On January 4, 1995, the Court entered a De-cree, Parenting Plan and Order of Child Support. The client retained new counsel, who successfully set aside the default orders. The parties reached agreement. The client filed a malpractice action against Mr. Atherton and obtained a default judgment, which Mr. Atherton has paid.During this time, Mr. Atherton suffered many personal and emotional problems. These problems mitigated the sanction to two reprimands. Mr. Atherton agreed to satisfy the clientâ€™s judgment as restitution.By failing to file pleadings, attend court dates and prevent default orders, Mr. Athertonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to diligently represent his clients.By failing to keep his clients informed of the status of their cases, Mr. Athertonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4(a).Jean Kelley McElroy represented the Bar Association.

Burns (WSBA No. 12957, admitted 1982), of Montana, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective March 23, 2000, following a default hearing. The discipline is based upon abandoning his practice without notice to his clients, failing to properly deal with client funds, failure to diligently represent clients, and negotiating settlement checks with forged endorsements and converting client funds to his own use.Abandonment of PracticeIn December 1997, Mr. Burns transferred to inactive status with the Bar Association. Shortly after this date, he left Washington, abandoning his practice. He failed to notify his clients of his absence, make arrangements for another lawyer to take over his client matters, or return files and documents to his clients. The Bar Association appointed a file custodian, who found unopened mail, unfiled documents, and client files with little or no work or client contact. Mr. Burnsâ€™ conduct violated RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to protect clientsâ€™ interests when withdrawing from representation.Trust Account IssuesThe Bar Association audited Mr. Burnsâ€™ trust account after he transferred to inactive status. The auditor found that Mr. Burns did not keep sufficient records to accurately track client money paid to his office. Additionally, in several client matters, Mr. Burns failed to deposit client funds into his IOLTA trust account; failed to deposit client funds into a separate IOLTA account with interest paid to the client, when this would provide a net positive return for the client; failed to promptly pay or deliver client funds to client upon request; and failed to return unearned advance fee or cost deposits.Mr. Burnsâ€™ conduct violated RPC 1.14, requiring lawyers to deposit all client funds paid to the lawyer into an interest-bearing IOLTA account; maintain complete records of all client funds, securities and other properties coming into the lawyerâ€™s possession; and promptly pay or deliver client funds to the client upon request.Lack of Diligence and CommunicationIn three client matters, Mr. Burns failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing clients. In these same matters, he failed to keep the clients reasonably informed about the status of their legal matters. Mr. Burnsâ€™ conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring lawyers to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing clients; and RPC 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their legal matters and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.Dishonest ConductIn three client matters, Mr. Burns knowingly endorsed settlement checks for his clients without the clientsâ€™ knowledge or consent, negotiated the checks with forged endorsements, and intentionally converted the clientsâ€™ funds to his own use. Mr. Burnsâ€™ conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting committing a criminal act (theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and RPC 8.4 (c), prohibiting engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.Failure to Respond to Office of Disciplinary Counselâ€™s Requests for ResponseMr. Burns failed to respond to the Office of Disciplinary Counselâ€™s written requests for response in five matters. Mr. Burnsâ€™ conduct violated RLD 2.8(a), requiring lawyers to promptly respond to any inquiry or request made for information relevant to grievances or other matters under investigation concerning a lawyerâ€™s conduct.Jean McElroy represented the Bar Association.

Atkinson (WSBA No. 14715, admitted November 6, 1984) has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court, effective January 7, 1999. The discipline is based upon his taking excess fees, failing to pay medical providers, and failing to properly account for client funds.On May 14, 1998, the WSBA auditor reported the results of a random audit of Mr. Atkinsonâ€™s trust account. The auditor found that during the period April 1, 1997 through April 16, 1998, Mr. Atkinson had removed $5,513.70 more from his trust account than he had earned, and that his trust account was $20,537.36 short. The auditor concluded that much of the shortfall could be traced to Mr. Atkinsonâ€™s failure to pay health-care providers.Based on the results of the random audit, WSBA obtained an order for an expanded audit. This expanded audit showed that for the period January 1, 1994 through July 27, 1998, Mr. Atkinson took excess fees totaling $14,933.10 from 15 clients and that his trust account was $27,082.35 short. During the period between the first and second audits, Mr. Atkinson failed to correct the noted recordkeeping deficiencies.Mr. Atkinsonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.5, requiring reasonable fees; RPC 1.1(a), prohibiting acts of moral turpitude and acts reflecting disregard for the rule of law; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, deceit and misrepresentation; RPC 1.14, requiring lawyers to promptly deliver client funds to clients; and RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring lawyers to preserve the identity of client funds and property.Linda Eide represented the Bar Association.

311.html,11444,Richard Basarab,,Disbarment,1/7/1999,,"Seattle lawyer Richard A. Basarab (WSBA No. 11444, admitted May 11, 1981) has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court, effective January 7, 1999. The discipline is based upon his practicing law, and collecting fees from clients to practice law, while his license was suspended; failing to diligently represent his clients; and contacting a party represented by counsel.On May 24, 1991, Mr. Basarabâ€™s license to practice law was suspended for non-payment of dues. His license remained suspended until he was disbarred. On May 15, 1997, Mr. Basarab pled guilty, pursuant to an Alford plea, to one count of first-degree theft, one count of second-degree theft, and two counts of unauthorized practice of law.Matter 1. On October 4, 1993, Mr. Basarab agreed to represent a client in a wrongful discharge suit. Mr. Basarab signed the summons, but did not put his WSBA number on the complaint. He failed to conduct discovery and did not attempt to answer the opposing partyâ€™s interrogatories, until after a motion to compel was filed. Mr. Basarab submitted the interrogatories unsigned and without the three binders of supporting documentation his client had provided. On May 1, 1995, the client learned that Mr. Basarabâ€™s license was suspended, terminated his services and requested her file. The client discovered a motion to compel scheduled for the day before she received her file. Mr. Basarab had not notified the client of this motion. The Court entered a $1,000 judgment for terms against the client for failure to comply or appear at the motion. Mr. Basarab stated that he intended to find substitute counsel for his client, if litigation was necessary. However, the client terminated his services prior to his attempts to find other counsel.Matter 2. In April 1995, Mr. Basarab agreed to draft an employment agreement for a parking lot construction estimator. Although Mr. Basarab told the client he could draft employment agreements, the contract draft contained mistakes that were not in the clientâ€™s best interests. During this same meeting, the client told Mr. Basarab that he needed a civil suit filed because his former employer did not pay his medical insurance premiums. Mr. Basarab filed the lawsuit in January 1996, and promised to inform the clientâ€™s creditors that they would be paid out of the settlement proceeds. Mr. Basarab altered a money order he received from another client to pay the $110 filing fee for the clientâ€™s complaint. Mr. Basarab also agreed to collect on a bounced commission check and file suit against another previous employer who failed to pay commissions. Mr. Basarab did not file the suit or collect the check. Finally, Mr. Basarab agreed to draft the contract for the sale of the clientâ€™s company. Mr. Basarab completed the sale.Matter 3. Between October 1992 and October 1993, a client paid Mr. Basarab $750 to file a bankruptcy petition. Mr. Basarab did not file the bankruptcy petition. On October 5, 1995, the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection paid the client. Mr. Basarab has not reimbursed the fund. Mr. Basarab stated that he agreed only to assist the client in preparing documents, not to appear as her lawyer.Matter 4. In June 1994, Mr. Basarab agreed to review a settlement proposal in a wrongful termination claim. Mr. Basarab told the client that he was experienced in labor law. Mr. Basarab and the client agreed that the settlement was not acceptable. Subsequently, the Human Rights Commission dismissed the clientâ€™s complaint. Mr. Basarab agreed to file a civil lawsuit for the client. On January 16, 1996, the client sent Mr. Basarab a money order for $110 for the filing fee. Mr. Basarab altered the money order and used it to pay for another clientâ€™s filing fee. Mr. Basarab never filed the lawsuit or refunded the clientâ€™s money.Matter 5. In June 1995, Mr. Basarab agreed to represent the alleged father in a paternity action. The client gave Mr. Basarab the papers he received from the Office of Support Enforcement, and Mr. Basarab agreed to take care of the matters. Mr. Basarab did not respond to the Office of Support Enforcement. In October 1995, the King County Prosecuting Attorney filed a Motion for Default Judgment against the client, citing failure to appear. Mr. Basarab told his client that the Court was wrong, because he had filed a response the day the default order was entered. The client took no further action and DSHS began garnishing his paycheck.Matter 6. In July 1995, Mr. Basarab agreed to represent the tenant in an unlawful detainer action.Mr. Basarab drafted a Motion for an Order of Stay for the client to sign pro se. The client believed that he had retained Mr. Basarab as his lawyer. Mr. Basarab and his client went to court together and obtained a one-day stay. During the court appearance, Mr. Basarab told the court that he was assisting, not representing, the client. Later, the Snohomish County Sheriff removed the rented mobile home, because the medically disabled client was not able to pay the back rent.Matter 7. Mr. Basarab represented a client in an American Arbitration Association (AAA) arbitration. Mr. Basarab told the parties and the arbitrator that he was not licensed to practice, and the arbitrator allowed him to represent the client. During the arbitration proceeding, Mr. Basarab presented exhibits, examined and cross-examined witnesses, and submitted memoranda on behalf of his client. The arbitrator awarded Mr. Basarab $3,625 as ""representative fees,"" pursuant to an attorneyâ€™s-fees clause in the disputed contract. Following the arbitration, Mr. Basarab contacted the opposing party directly, instead of through counsel, to attempt to collect the fees. The opposing party challenged the award of fees, and the King County Superior Court denied Mr. Basarabâ€™s fees. The Court concluded that the contract allowed attorneyâ€™s fees, and Mr. Basarab could not have been acting as an attorney, because his license was suspended.Matter 8. In late 1995, Mr. Basarab accepted $750 and agreed to file a lawsuit for a client. In mid-1997, the client learned that Mr. Basarabâ€™s license was suspended and that he had not filed the lawsuit.Matter 9. On May 6, 1998, Mr. Basa-rab appeared with a client in Poulsbo Municipal Court. Mr. Basarab requested, and the Court granted, a continuance of the pre-trial conference scheduled to be heard that day. The Judge asked Mr. Basarab if he intended to file a notice of appearance in the case. Mr. Basarab stated that he would file a notice of appearance and hoped to reach an agreement after speaking to the prosecutor.Mr. Basarabâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 8.4, prohibiting a lawyer from committing a crime that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer; RCW 2.48.180, making it a crime to engage in the unauthorized practice of law; RPC 5.5(a), prohibiting the practice of law where doing so violates the regulation of the legal profession; RLD 1.1(l), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in the practice of law while suspended; RLD 1.1(p), prohibiting conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law; RLD 8.2, prohibiting a disbarred or suspended attorney from accepting a retainer, giving legal advice, or acting as a lawyer for another in a legal matter; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; and RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep clients informed as to the status of their matters.Sachia Stonefeld represented the Bar Association.

Murray (WSBA No. 24851, admitted June 20, 1995) has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective January 11, 1999. The discipline is based upon her charging an excessive fee, failing to return the unearned portion of a non-refundable retainer; failing to diligently represent her clients; and failing to comply with a court order.Ms. Murray agreed to draft a will for her clientâ€™s terminally ill brother. Ms. Murray told the client that she had been in practice for four years, but had only actually been licensed for two and one-half years. Ms. Murray drafted the will, and the brother signed two days before he died. Ms. Murrayâ€™s client was appointed executor of her brotherâ€™s estate. The estate consisted of $900,000, mostly in bank accounts. One account, with a balance of $250,000, was held by the client and the brother as joint tenants with right of survivorship (JTWRS account). Ms. Murray advised her client that the assets in that account would pass to her outside probate and would not be subject to federal estate taxes. Excluding this account, the estate was worth more than $600,000 and subject to federal estate taxes.Ms. Murray told her client that the customary fee for probating an estate was 10 percent of the estate assets, but that she would take this case for 5 percent, or $30,000. Ms. Murray did not prepare a written fee agreement or explain to the client that any portion of this fee was non-refundable. The client did not know that this was not the customary fee for a probate, and gave Ms. Murray two checks, one for $28,000 for legal fees and another $2,000 for costs. Ms. Murray deposited the $2,000 check into her trust account and the $28,000 check into another account.Ms. Murray advised her client that to avoid federal estate tax, the client should write Ms. Murray an additional check for $15,000, the amount subject to estate tax if the JTWRS account was included. Ms. Murray explained that she would place these funds in her trust account, and then return them to the client later. The client wrote this additional check and Ms. Murray deposited it in her trust account. Including this check, Ms. Murray collected $45,000 from the client. During this same time period, Ms. Murray had not obtained non-intervention powers, obtained an order of solvency, published notice to creditors, or given notice to the heirs. RCW 11.48.210 requires an order of solvency and an order granting non-intervention powers prior to collecting a fee from the estate, unless the fee is approved by court order.Christine Gray represented the Bar Association.

The suspension was effective from January 11, 1999 until February 15, 1999.In June 1995, Ms. Bartu agreed to represent a Romanian citizen in an asylum proceeding before the Immigration Court. In August 1995, the Court notified Ms. Bartu of a July 1996 hearing. Ms. Bartu did not notify her client of this hearing. In February 1996, Ms. Bartu decided to withdraw from the clientâ€™s case. Ms. Bartu told the clientâ€™s interpreter that she intended to withdraw, but the client was not present during this conversation. Ms. Bartu prepared a Notice of Withdrawal, but did not file it with the Immigration Court, and did not serve her client until October 1996, when he picked up his file. Later, Ms. Bartu learned that her notice of withdrawal was not an effective way to withdraw in Immigration Court proceedings. In May 1996, the Immigration Court sent Ms. Bartu an advisory opinion about the clientâ€™s case and a reminder of the clientâ€™s July 1996 hearing. Ms. Bartu did not notify the client about the advisory opinion or hearing. In June 1996, the INS served the Preliminary Statement in the clientâ€™s case on Ms. Bartu. Ms. Bartu did not notify the client about the Statement and did not file any responsive materials. Neither Ms. Bartu nor the client attended the July hearing. The Immigration Judge conducted the hearing and denied the clientâ€™s application for asylum and his request to withhold his deportation. The Judge set a voluntary departure date of October 15, 1996, and included a deportation order. The Immigration Court sent Ms. Bartu a copy of the order. Ms. Bartu did not notify the client of the order. In August 1996, the client received a letter from the INS stating that in light of the decision in his case, he must be out of the country by January 2, 1997. The client then wrote to Ms. Bartu to find out the status of this case. Ms Bartu did not respond. On October 26, 1996, the client met with Ms. Bartu and found out about the July 1996 hearing for the first time. He took his file and went to the INS to determine his status. An INS officer arrested the client on the spot and he spent five weeks in INS detention. On December 6, 1996, the clientâ€™s new lawyer moved to reopen his case based on ineffective assistance of counsel. On January 2, 1997, the Immigration Court granted the motion. During this time period, Ms. Bartu was moving her office and going through a painful dissolution.By failing to advise her client of the hearing date, Ms. Bartuâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent clients; and RPC 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients informed about the status of their cases. By failing to notify the client that she had withdrawn from his case, and by failing to take steps to protect his interest, Ms. Bartuâ€™s violated RPC 1.15, requiring withdrawing lawyers to take steps to protect the clientâ€™s interests; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.Jean McElroy represented the Bar Association.

316.html,13699,David Corkrum,,Suspension,3/22/1999,,"Franklin County lawyer David W. Corkrum (WSBA No. 13699, admitted 1983) has been suspended for 45 days, following a hearing, by order of the Supreme Court dated March 15, 1999. The discipline is based upon his failure to diligently represent his clients, and failure to keep his clients advised about the status of their cases. The suspension became effective March 22, 1999.Matter 1. In April 1992, Mr. Corkrum agreed to represent a client in a child support modification action. Mr. Corkrum stated that he prepared the Petition to Modify Child Support, but did not file the petition, because he wanted to serve the father first. In April 1992, the father, an active member of the armed forces, was ordered overseas as a part of Operation Desert Storm. The father returned to the United States in July 1992. Based on conversations with Mr. Corkrum, the client believed that the father had been served with the petition. The petition was never served on the father. Mr. Corkrum did not correct his clientâ€™s belief that the petition had been served, because he was on probation with the WSBA and wanted to resolve this matter favorably. In February 1993, Mr. Corkrum told his client that he had not served the petition. Although he asked to continue working on the case, on March 1, 1993, the client told Mr. Corkrum to stop working on her case. The client demanded her client file and $3,760, which she apparently calculated to include the amounts she paid Mr. Corkrum and what she could have received in increased child support. Mr. Corkrum wrote the client a check in that amount the same day. The client then demanded an additional $308. When Mr. Corkrum refused to pay the additional amount, the client filed a grievance with the WSBA.Matter 2. A client retained Mr. Corkrum to represent him in a case against a company for wrongful exposure to chlorine gas. Mr. Corkrum concluded that it would be difficult to prove that the damage to the clientâ€™s lungs had been caused by the chlorine exposure, and not by his clientâ€™s own cigarette smoking. Although Mr. Corkrum had decided not to file a complaint, he did not convey this decision to the client. The statute of limitations on the clientâ€™s claim lapsed before Mr. Corkrum told the client that he would not file a complaint. The client filed a malpractice action against Mr. Corkrum, and obtained a $300,000 default judgment.By failing to timely file and serve the Petition to Modify Child Support, Mr. Corkrum violated RPC 1.3 requiring a lawyer to diligently represent his clients; and RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the clientâ€™s interests. By failing to tell one client that he had not filed and served the Petition to Modify Child Support, and another client that he had not filed a complaint before the statute of limitations had lapsed, Mr. Corkrum violated RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of the matter; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud or misrepresentation.Leslie Allen represented the Bar Association.

The discipline is based upon his failure to avoid conflicts of interest.Mr. Eck drafted several estate-planning documents for a husband and wife, including a Family Trust. Mr. Eck also formed a limited liability company for the clients. Over approximately four years, Mr. Eck drafted several amendments to these documents. In 1996, the coupleâ€™s relationship deteriorated to the point that the husband wanted to disinherit the wife. During this time, and without disclosing the conflict of interest to the parties, Mr. Eck made changes to the estate planning documents which were potentially detrimental to the wife. Mr. Eck also drafted a gift of $50,000 from the husband to himself. Mr. Eck strongly suggested to the client that he obtain independent legal advice prior to executing the gift to Mr. Eck, which the client did.Mr. Eckâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.7, prohibiting lawyers from representing clients whose interests are directly adverse, unless the lawyer reasonably believes that the representation will not adversely affect the lawyerâ€™s relationship with the clients and each client consents in writing, after full disclosure.

The suspension is based on a three-month suspension order of the Nevada Supreme Court.In 1994, Mr. Carucci submitted false documentation to a consumer lender to obtain approval to purchase a boat. He submitted false income tax returns, which were not actually filed with the IRS, and false personal income statements. In his marriage dissolution action deposition, Mr. Carucci admitted submitting the false loan documentation. He also admitted these actions in his disciplinary case deposition. However, when he learned that the lender had destroyed all of the supporting loan documentation, Mr. Carucci attempted to recant his admissions and change his testimony.

The discipline is based upon her making knowing misrepresentation of fact to the district court in a citizenâ€™s complaint in 1997.In January 1993, Ms. Carlson married Mr. K. They separated in February 1994 and were involved in bitter dissolution proceedings from March 1994 through May 1998. While the dissolution was pending, Ms. Carlson lived in the family home, and her mother-in-law lived in a mobile home on the same property.In 1995, two men related to the ex-husband emerged from the mother-in-lawâ€™s home and confronted Ms. Carlson in her wheelchair; she ended up on the ground. The facts regarding the incident are disputed. Either the men were retrieving a fence post that belonged to the mother-in-law and Ms. Carlson hung on, causing herself to fall, or the men assaulted Ms. Carlson. Ms. Carlson was injured and reported the incident to the Thurston County Sheriffâ€™s Office. The sherriffâ€™s office investigated, but did not recommend prosecution. Ms. Carlson complained to the sherriff about the lack of prosecution of this and other incidents. Subsequently, she met with a deputy prosecuting attorney at her home to review records. The deputy indicated that he believed there was insufficient evidence to file a criminal charge.In 1997, Ms. Carlson contacted the prosecutor again and provided him with transcribed testimony in the civil-crime victim-compensation case that he had not previously considered. The prosecutor again met with Ms. Carlson and indicated that he still did not believe there was enough evidence to file a criminal charge.In 1997, Ms. Carlson typed and filed a citizens complaint regarding the 1995 incident. The complaint stated: ""I have not consulted with a prosecuting authority concerning this incident. . . ."" On this same day, Ms. Carlson filed a petition in Thurston County Superior Court requesting a domestic-violence order of protection against one of the two men involved in the 1995 incident. Following a hearing, the court denied the request.In April 1997, Ms. Carlson filed a petition in Thurston County Superior Court requesting an order of protection from unlawful harassment against the two men involved in the 1995 incident. As part of this petition, Ms. Carlson answered ""no"" to the following question: Have you ever sued the person who is harassing you in any court, or has that person ever sued you in any court?In May 1997, Ms. Carlson amended her citizen complaint and again stated that she had not consulted with a prosecuting authority concerning the incident. The hearing officer found that Ms. Carlson made knowing misrepresentations. Ms. Carlsonsâ€™s citizen complaint was denied. The judge stated: ""Further, it appears this matter was investigated by law enforcement and the matter was referred to the Thurston County Prosecutors, who declined to prosecute.

The discipline is based on her depositing money paid by firm clients into her personal account.Ms. Ludington Green was employed as a full-time contract lawyer and later as an associate with a law firm. The firmâ€™s unwritten policy, which Ms. Ludington Green was aware of, was that all client money was given to the bookkeeper to be deposited.On at least four occasions with three clients, Ms. Ludington Green deposited the clientsâ€™ checks into her personal account. Although Ms. Ludington Green believes that she documented these payments in file notes that would have been sent to the bookkeeper, none of the amounts showed up on the clientsâ€™ billing statements. When the bookkeeper told Ms. Ludington Green that a client had asked about a $1,200 payment, she asked the bookkeeper if the payment could be considered as an advance. The bookkeeper and Ms. Ludington Green agreed that the money should be paid back to the firm through payroll deduction. Only $100 was actually deducted.A firm partner wrote to Ms. Ludington Green in September 1994, asking why a clientâ€™s checks had not been delivered to the bookkeeper. Ms. Ludington Green responded that she had ""bonuses on the books."" She offered to repay the amount if asked, and also volunteered that she had deposited another clientâ€™s payments into her personal account. In February 1995, the firm asked Ms. Ludington Green to sign a $10,894.88 Confession of Judgment. Although both Ms. Ludington Green and her spouse signed the document, they refused to have their signatures acknowledged. At the time of the stipulation, Ms. Ludington Green had made no payments on the judgment. The Supreme Court order requires the judgment amount to be repaid prior to reinstatement.Ms. Ludington Greenâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.14, requiring that client funds be deposited into a lawyerâ€™s trust account; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.Marsha Matsumoto represented the Bar Association.

This discipline is based on Ms. Sureauâ€™s practicing law prior to being admitted to practice in Washington, and conflicts of interest.Ms. Sureau and her husband moved to Washington from California, where Ms. Sureau was admitted to practice in 1987. Mr. Sureauâ€™s daughter lived in Washington. Mr. Sureauâ€™s mother, Ms. E, was transferred to a Washington convalescent center while Mr. and Mrs. Sureau lived in California. The daughter signed a promissory note for convalescent care for Ms. E, because she lived close to the center. The daughter believed that the care would be paid for either by insurance or sale of Ms. Eâ€™s home. In May 1992, the convalescent center sued the daughter. The daughter contacted Ms. Sureau in California for advice about the lawsuit. Ms. Sureau advised the daughter and provided form pleadings for the daughterâ€™s use. The daughter typed her answer on Ms. Sureauâ€™s computer. Ms. Sureau advised the daughter to implead Ms. Eâ€™s insurance company, which the daughter did. These pleadings were filed July 9, 1992. On July 30, 1992, Ms. Sureau sent a copy of the pleadings to the New York State Insurance Department for service of process. The letterhead identified Ms. Sureau as a lawyer and listed her Washington address. Ms. Sureau was admitted to practice in Washington on November 5, 1992.In early 1993, Ms. Sureau told the daughter that she planned to stop representing her, and in March the daughter retained new counsel. After this, Ms. E and Mr. Sureau were added to the lawsuit. Ms. Sureau appeared for Ms. E and her husband in the lawsuit. She filed an answer that included a claim for contribution, reimbursement and indemnity against the daughter. The daughter filed a motion to disqualify Ms. Sureau from representing Ms. E and Mr. Sureau. Ms. Sureau opposed the motion, stating that she should be allowed to remain in the case to protect her own financial interest. The court disqualified her.Ms. Sureauâ€™s conduct violated RPC 5.5, prohibiting practicing law in a jurisdiction where doing so violated the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction; RPC 1.9(a), prohibiting a lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter from representing another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that personâ€™s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client, unless the former client consents in writing after consultation and a full disclosure of the material facts; and RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to another client or by the lawyerâ€™s own interests.Julie Shankland represented the Bar Association.

The discipline is based upon his failure to diligently represent and accurately communicate with clients.Matter 1:In spring 1992, Mr. Thomas agreed to represent a client in a wrongful garnishment matter. A credit reporting company issued an inaccurate credit report, causing the clientâ€™s garnishment. Mr. Thomas prepared and filed the lawsuit in King County Superior Court. The case scheduling order set the trial date as September 26, 1994. Mr. Thomas did not notify his client of the trial date. In August 1994, the defendant tendered a settlement check to Mr. Thomas. Even though Mr. Thomasâ€™s client did not agree to the settlement, he retained the check. Mr. Thomas did not prepare or appear for trial. Since neither party appeared for trial, the case was dismissed the following day. Based on inaccurate information from Mr. Thomas, the client believed that the lawsuit was still pending. In fall 1995, the client contacted the court and discovered that the case had been dismissed. The client was not able to find another lawyer to pursue his case.Matter 2:In 1996, Mr. Thomas agreed to represent the wife in a dissolution action. In August 1996, he obtained temporary orders that did not address two of his clientsâ€™ concerns â€” payment of medical bills and dental costs. In February 1998, the client met with her husband to try to resolve the case because she believed that Mr. Thomas was not making any progress. Later that month, opposing counsel sent Mr. Thomas proposed final pleadings. Mr. Thomas approved the pleadings for entry without consulting his client. Mr. Thomas believed that the proposed orders were consistent with his clientâ€™s objectives. The client learned that she was divorced in a phone call from her ex-husband. The client obtained new counsel who resolved the case with increased child support and medical payments.Matter 3: In August 1997, Mr. Thomas agreed to represent grandparents in a case to obtain care and custody of their three-year-old granddaughter. The childâ€™s father was incarcerated and the mother had experienced intermittent drug dependence. Mr. Thomas prepared a guardianship agreement providing that the grandparents would have physical custody and control of the child, and the mother would have visitation, so long as she remained drug free. The parties signed this agreement in September 1997. In December 1997, the grandparents asked Mr. Thomas to obtain permanent custody of the child for them. Mr. Thomas prepared pleadings, which both parties signed. He also prepared a nonparental custody petition. He never filed these documents. Based on inaccurate information from Mr. Thomas, the clients believed that the petition had been filed. The clients retained new counsel who completed the case.Mr. Thomasâ€™ conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring lawyers to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.2, requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; RPC 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.Maria Regimbal represented the Bar Association.

The Supreme Courtâ€™s order of reciprocal discipline, pursuant to Rule for Lawyer Discipline (RLD) 12.6, is based on the Oregon Supreme Courtâ€™s April 29, 1999 order approving a stipulation to discipline. The Court ordered the Washington suspension to run concurrently with the Oregon suspension, beginning on June 28, 1999.From August 1989 through July 1991, Mr. Wittemyer represented Pacific Chips, a timber corporation. During this time, he served as legal counsel, secretary and registered agent. He also owned stock in Pacific Chips.Also in 1989, Mr. Wittemyer began representing a client, Ms. X. From mid-1989 through mid-1990, he was involved in a romantic relationship with Ms. X. Pacific Chips asked Ms. X for a $300,000 business loan. Ms. X agreed to loan Pacific Chips $150,000 if Mr. Wittemyer would do the same. He agreed, but did not reduce the agreement to writing or inform Pacific Chips of his participation. Mr. Wittemyer did not advise Ms. X of the potential conflicts of interest, even though another attorney suggested this. The loan closed in December 1989. Mr. Wittemyer drafted the promissory note, UCC financing statement and security agreement, all indicating the whole $300,000 was owed to Ms. X. He told Ms. X it would look better if his interest was not disclosed. After a few interest-only payments on the loan, Pacific Chips defaulted. Mr. Wittemyer took several actions to collect the loan, including retaining a lawyer. He instructed the lawyer to bill Ms. X, but to send the bills to his office. Mr. Wittemyer drafted a lawsuit against Pacific Chips, which the lawyer filed. The lawsuit named only Ms. X. Mr. Wittemyer accepted service of the lawsuit on behalf of Pacific Chips. In July 1991, the court entered a default judgment against Pacific Chips for $300,000, plus $50,000 in punitive damages and costs and attorneyâ€™s fees. Ms. X recovered her initial investment, but not her attorneyâ€™s fees or interest on the loan. Mr. Wittemyer recovered approximately $25,000 of the amount he loaned Pacific Chips.Mr. Wittemyerâ€™s actions violated Oregon DR 5-101(A), prohibiting accepting or continuing employment when the exercise of judgment on behalf of the client is or may be affected by business, property or personal interests; DR 4-104(A), prohibiting entering a business transaction with a client in which the lawyer and the client have differing interests; and DR 105(E), prohibiting representing multiple clients with conflicting interests.Joanne Abelson represented the Bar Association.

DeGlow (WSBA No. 13357, admitted 1983), of Spokane, has been suspended for one year by order of the Supreme Court effective May 31, 2001, following a default hearing. The discipline is based on his failure to diligently represent and communicate with a client in 1998 and 1999, failure to comply with a court order, and failure to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation.In 1995, Mr. DeGlow agreed to represent a client injured in an automobile accident. In 1997, the client believed he had completed his medical treatment and asked Mr. DeGlow to move forward on his case. Mr. DeGlow filed a complaint for damages in May 1998. Between June 1998 and April 1999, the parties exchanged interrogatories. Mr. DeGlow did not return the clientâ€™s phone calls in April and early May 1999. On May 5, the client left a message indicating that if he did not hear from Mr. DeGlow by May 7, he would assume that Mr. DeGlow was no longer interested in representing him. Mr. DeGlow left the client a message, but did not take any action on the case.On June 1, 1999, the client terminated Mr. DeGlowâ€™s services and requested that his file and an accounting of Mr. DeGlowâ€™s bills be sent to him. Mr. DeGlow did not respond to the clientâ€™s request. In July 1999, the client retained new counsel. Mr. DeGlow sent a partial copy of the clientâ€™s file to new counsel, but it did not include a summons, complaint or interrogatories. Mr. DeGlow also failed to sign the withdrawal and substitution-of-counsel form provided by new counsel. On September 17, 1999, the court issued an order requiring Mr. DeGlow to ""immediately release all materials in his possession or provide documentation that he had no further records,"" and assessed sanctions. As of the hearing date, Mr. DeGlow had not complied with the court order or paid the sanctions. Mr. DeGlow also failed to comply with disciplinary counselâ€™s requests for information, avoided service of a deposition subpoena, and failed to appear for his deposition.Mr. DeGlowâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3 and 3.2, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters; 1.15(d), requiring lawyers to take reasonable steps to protect clientsâ€™ interests upon withdrawal; 3.4, prohibiting lawyers from knowingly disobeying obligations under the rules of a tribunal; and RLD 2.8, requiring lawyers to cooperate with disciplinary investigations.Sachia Stonefeld represented the Bar Association.

The Supreme Courtâ€™s order of reciprocal discipline, pursuant to RLD 12.6, is based on the Hearing Panel for the Law Society of British Columbiaâ€™s October 8, 1999 order for a 90-day suspension. The Washington Supreme Court ordered that Mr. Samuelsâ€™ Washington suspension run concurrently with the British Columbia suspension.In 1996, Mr. Samuels represented two clients in an assault case in Delta Provincial Court. He intended to obtain diversion for these clients. In March 1996, The Crown advised Mr. Samuels that diversion would not be acceptable. In May 1996, three days prior to trial, Mr. Samuels applied to the Court to adjourn (continue) the trials. When it appeared that the Court would not grant the motion, Mr. Samuels told the Court that he had spoken with the clientsâ€™ mothers, and implied that his contact was recent. In fact, Mr. Samuels had not contacted the clientsâ€™ mothers for a considerable time prior to the hearing. Mr. Samuels later admitted to implying to the judge that he had recently spoken with his clientsâ€™ mothers, knowing that this was inaccurate.

The Supreme Courtâ€™s order of reciprocal discipline, pursuant to Rule 12.6 of the Rules for Lawyer Discipline, is based on a New Jersey Supreme Court order disbarring Waltz for disbursing legal fees to himself without authorization, attempting to conceal the disbursements, and failing to cooperate with the New Jersey ethics authorities.On May 15, 1997, the Washington State Bar Association (the Association) filed with the Washington Supreme Court an order from the New Jersey Supreme Court order disbarring Waltz. On the same day, the Court issued an order directing the Association to issue a notice of reciprocal discipline to Waltz pursuant to RLD 12.6. This notice, served on Waltz on June 6, 1997, advised Waltz to inform the Court within 30 days of any claim that reciprocal discipline should not be imposed in this state.Thereafter, Waltz filed a pleading with the Supreme Court alleging that reciprocal discipline was unwarranted because he was denied due process in the New Jersey proceeding. Waltz attached to this pleading copies of motions he filed in the New Jersey Supreme Court to reconsider and to vacate/stay the New Jersey order of disbarment. These motions also alleged Waltz was denied due process. The Washington Supreme Court then ordered investigation into whether Waltz had constitutionally adequate notice of the New Jersey Supreme Court disbarment proceedings.The New Jersey Supreme Court subsequently denied Waltzâ€™s motions to stay, to reconsider and to vacate. The Association and Waltz thereafter filed briefing with the Washington Supreme Court primarily concerning the alleged due process violation.The Washington Supreme Court considered en banc the reciprocal discipline matter and imposed the reciprocal discipline.The Association was represented by Disciplinary Counsel Maureen Devlin.

The Washington Supreme Court approved the RLD 12.6 reciprocal discipline by order dated June 30, 2000. The discipline is based upon his delay in paying funds to an insurance company, and making an unwarranted argument regarding his clientâ€™s entitlement to the funds.Mr. Meigs represented a client injured in an automobile accident. He negotiated a settlement with the other driverâ€™s insurance company. The settlement included a $9,600.23 payment to the clientâ€™s insurance company to reimburse PIP (personal injury protection) payments already made to her. The PIP reimbursement check stated on its face, ""full and final settlement of PIP lien."" An accompanying letter also indicated that the check would satisfy the PIP lien. The check was made out to the client and her insurance company.On June 19, 1996, Mr. Meigs deposited the check into his trust account without obtaining the insurance companyâ€™s endorsement or notifying it of the check. Mr. Meigs advised the clientâ€™s insurance company that he would settle his clientâ€™s unfiled claim against the driver of the car in which she had been a passenger if they would waive the PIP reimbursement. The insurance company rejected the settlement offer and demanded full PIP reimbursement, which Mr. Meigs refused to pay. The insurance company made two additional demands for the PIP reimbursement and the accrued interest. Mr. Meigs did not pay the PIP reimbursement until July 10, 1997. Neither the client nor Mr. Meigs had any claim to the PIP reimbursement funds.By depositing the check and retaining the proceeds without any claim of right, Mr. Meigsâ€™ conduct violated Oregon DR 1-102 (A)(3), prohibiting misrepresentation; and Oregon DR 7-102(A)(2), prohibiting knowingly advancing an unwarranted claim.Douglas Ende represented the Bar Association.

The disbarment, which was pursuant to a stipulation, was based on Ennis-Keener's misappropriation of client funds.Ennis-Keener was a shareholder in a law firm that represented plaintiffs in personal injury claims. In August of 1993, she settled a client's claim. The firm withheld $4,189 due to a pending subrogation interest by an insurance company for personal injury protection benefits. After the insurance company did not respond to repeated inquiries, it was determined to release the funds to the client. In the spring of 1994, Ennis-Keener informed the firm that she was terminating her association with the firm.On her last day at the firm, Ennis-Keener requested and received a check payable to the client for $4,189 drawn on the firmâ€™s trust account. The check was not signed. Ennis-Keener inadvertently held the check until she found it in mid July 1994. She then signed it in the name of the law firm administrator without authorization to do so, and forged the client's endorsement, making the check payable to herself. She then deposited the check in her personal bank account.The law firm's comptroller contacted Ennis-Keener after the client told the firm she had not received the funds withheld for the subrogation interest. Ennis-Keener told the comptroller that the client had paid the funds to her for legal work done separate from the firmâ€™s representation. Ennis-Keener then called the client and told her that there appeared to be fraudulent behavior by a former bookkeeper of the firm, that Ennis-Keener was handling the situation, and that a meeting was to be held among the bookkeeper, the bookkeeper's attorney, the firm and Ennis-Keener. The client contacted the firm, and the firm's managing partner called Ennis-Keener. Ennis-Keener admitted that she had fraudulently converted the check and stated that she would repay the client that day. Later that day, she brought the client a cashier's check for $5,000, representing the misappropriated funds, plus interest and additional compensation for inconveniences.Ennis-Keener stipulated that the facts summarized above established by a clear preponderance of the evidence that she violated Rule 1.1 (a) (acts involving moral turpitude and dishonesty) and 1.1 (p) (conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law) of the Rules for Lawyer Discipline, and Rules 8el(c) (act involving dishonesty, fraud. deceit or misrepresentation), 1.14(a) (client funds must be maintained in trust account), 1.14(b)(3) (lawyer must render appropriate accounts regarding client funds), and 1.14(b)(4) (requiring prompt payment to client of funds client is entitled to receive) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.Ennis-Keener was represented by Leland G.

Heard (WSBA No. 12272, admitted 1982), of Aberdeen, has been suspended from the practice of law for two years by order of the Washington Supreme Court, dated September 24, 1998. The suspension, effective immediately, is based on his financial and sexual exploitation of a client.Financial MisconductIn 1989, Mr. Heard represented a 23-year-old woman who suffered serious head injuries and was in a coma for two weeks as a result of a motorcycle accident. Mr. Heard negotiated settlements on her behalf with her insurance company and the insurer for the owner of the motorcycle. Each insurer settled for policy limits of $25,000. The other driver settled by purportedly transferring a portion of an undocumented and unrecorded interest in a house and the title to an automobile registered to the driver, both of which assets proved illusory. Mr. Heard valued the total settlement at $150,000. The two $25,000 insurance checks were the only cash received in settlement of the clientâ€™s claims; Mr. Heard kept all of the cash as his one-third contingency fee.Mr. Heard never provided his client with an accounting of the settlement proceeds and fee.In assigning a specific value to the purported transfer of the house, Mr. Heard relied on the statements of the driver, who claimed he paid money to his sister for the house, that it was titled in her name, and that she owned an undivided, but untitled interest in it. Prior to the execution of the settlement agreement, Mr. Heard took no other steps to independently verify the existence or valuation of the driverâ€™s interest in the house. Mr. Heard did not have the automobile appraised prior to the settlement.Mr. Heard did not advise his client of problems which might result from the failure to verify the existence or value of the house interest or the automobile. Nor did he advise his client that he was retaining the only cash received in the settlement. Shortly after the settlement, the driverâ€™s sister sold the house. The client received nothing from the sale.After Mr. Heard received his fee, he took no steps to ensure that the client obtained the benefit from the purported house transfer, nor did he advise his client of contacts his office had with the driverâ€™s sister, wherein she denied any claim on her house by his client.Sexual MisconductPrior to final settlement of this matter, Mr. Heard went to the clientâ€™s house and asked her to go with him to a restaurant/lounge to talk about the case. Although the client told Mr. Heard she should not be drinking alcohol, and he knew from her medical records that she had a history of alcohol and sexual abuse, he bought drinks for her. After leaving the lounge, he asked her to drive his car to another lounge even though she had told him she could not drive because she was a habitual traffic offender with outstanding warrants. At the second lounge, he bought additional drinks for her. They then left and, at his suggestion, went to his apartment, where they spent the night together and engaged in consensual sexual relations.The Court found that Mr. Heardâ€™s financial exploitation of his client violated RPC 1.5; his failure to ascertain the status of the interest in the house violated the requirements of RPC 1.1 and 1.3 to completely and diligently represent the client; his failure to keep his client advised of the status of her matter violated RPC 1.4; and his sexual exploitation of his client was an act of moral turpitude in violation of RLD 1.1(a).Mr. Heard was represented by John Farra.

Ott (WSBA No. 12172, admitted 1981), of Kelso, received a reprimand on May 10, 2002, based on a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board in January 2002. This discipline is based on his failure to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions, failure to act with reasonable diligence, and failure to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters from 1999 to 2000.The Fs hired Mr. Ott on April 22, 1999 to initiate a nonjudicial foreclosure sale on real property in Pacific County. The clients instructed Mr. Ott to proceed with the sale immediately. On April 23, Mr. Ott sent the buyers a letter informing them that the Fs had retained him to initiate a foreclosure of their interests on the property. Mr. Ott did not cause a notice of default to be issued and posted on the property until June 10. Mr. Ott executed a notice of trustee sale on July 14, and set the date of the trusteeâ€™s sale for October 14. The notice was legally deficient because Mr. Ott had not been appointed successor trustee of the deed of trust and he set the sale in Cowlitz County, though no part of the property is in that county.On August 26, the buyers filed bankruptcy, Mr. Ott received notice, and the bankruptcy court set the meeting of creditors for October 6, 1999. The Fs did not learn of the bankruptcy proceeding until October 8, when they called Mr. Ottâ€™s office and spoke to his secretary. On the same day, they wrote Mr. Ott a letter shortly after inquiring about the bankruptcy. Mr. Ott did not respond to either the call or the letter. Although Mr. Ott was notified, he did not attend the meeting. Mr. Ott did not advise the Fs that through the bankruptcy they might have a right to the money the buyers collected as rent and/or to the personal property the buyers removed from the property.On December 20, 1999, Mr. Ott obtained a second notice of resignation and appointment of successor trustee, but he failed to record the notice. Even though Mr. Ott lacked the statutory authority to act, he initiated a second foreclosure proceeding on December 28 by mailing and serving a second notice of default on the buyers. By letters dated January 10 and 28, 2000, Mr. Ott erroneously informed the Fs that the notice of resignation and appointment of successor trustee was in effect and the foreclosure was progressing on schedule.On January 28, Mr. Ott signed and processed a second notice of trustee sale. The notice contained a typographical error setting the trusteeâ€™s sale for Sunday rather than Friday as required by RCW 61.24.040. The notice of trustee sale was deficient because Mr. Ott failed to follow the time requirements in the statute and failed to publish the notice in a newspaper. In April, Mr. Ott billed the Fs $1,320 in additional attorneyâ€™s fees.

35.html,13372,David Hemmelgarn,,Suspension,1/13/1997,,"Tacoma lawyer David C. Hemmelgarn (WSBA No. 13370, admitted 1983) has been ordered suspended for two years effective January 13, 1997, pursuant to a stipulation to discipline. The suspension is based upon Hemmelgarn's misconduct with respect to several client matters between early 1991 and fall 1995. Among the factors considered in mitigation of the disciplinary sanctions was Hemmelgarn's mental condition during this period, which affected his ability to practice law.Lack of Diligence, Competence and CommunicationCase 1 - Hemmelgarn was hired to represent a client against the State of Washington for a personal injury matter. He served a complaint for damages upon the incorrect statutory state employee, resulting in the suit being dismissed after the statute of limitations had expired. Hemmelgarn was unsuccessful in an appeal. Despite the dismissal, Hemmelgarn continued to assure the client and several health care providers for two years after the case had been dismissed that trial of the matter was pending. By failing to properly accomplish service of process within the period of the statute of limitations, Hemmelgarn violated RPC 1.1 (competence) and RPC 1.3 (diligence); by failing to inform client of the status of the case and of the dismissal of the lawsuit. Hemmelgarn violated RPC 1.4 (reasonably inform client about case), and by misrepresenting that the case had been dismissed to his client and to health care providers, Hemmelgarn violated RPC 8.4(c) (dishonesty). As part of the stipulation, Hemmelgarn has agreed to make restitution to his client of all out-of-pocket expenses, including medical care costs.Case 2 - After filing a petition for dissolution of his client's marriage, in May 1999, and conducting negotiations with the spouse's lawyer. Hemmelgarn ceased further action, failed to advise his client of a trial date, failed to appear for trial and, thereby, allowed a decree containing provisions contrary to the client's wishes to be entered. By failing to diligently pursue the client's dissolution, Hemmelgarn violated RPC 1.3 (diligence). By failing to keep the client informed about the case, Hemmelgarn violated RPC 1.4 (reasonably inform client about case). As part of the stipulation, Hemmelgarn has agreed to make restitution to the client for fees paid by the client to another lawyer hired to vacate the dissolution decree.Case 3 -In early 1991, Hemmelgarn, while an active member of the Oregon Bar, undertook the representation of two clients injured in a motor vehicle accident. Hemmelgarn subsequently failed to pay his bar dues, resulting in his suspension from the Oregon Bar. On the day the statute of limitations was to expire, Hemmelgarn requested the assistance of another Oregon lawyer, who filed a summons and complaint prepared by Hemmelgarn. Hemmelgarn failed to comply with Oregon law, which requires service be accomplished within sixty days of filing, or advise his client of the need to accomplish service within the sixty-day period. As a result, the lawsuit was dismissed. Hemmelgarn's waiting to the last day to file a complaint and his failure to make arrangements for the proper service of process violated RPC 1.1 (competence) and RPC 1.3 (diligence). His failure to tell his client of his suspension from the practice of law in Oregon and of the client's need to promptly seek new counsel violated RPC 1.4 (reasonably inform client about case).Case 4 - Hemmelgarn was hired in the fall of 1991 to defend a client in a suit to enforce a contract for the sale of a mobile home. He failed to appear timely at a hearing, and a default summary judgment was entered. Over the next few months, Hemmelgarn exchanged telephone calls and letters with opposing counsel, but did not move to vacate the default summary judgment until one hundred and eleven days after its entry. The motion was denied and Hemmelgarn failed to inform the client, who learned of the judgment when the client's bank account was garnished. Hemmelgarn's failure to respond to a summary judgment motion and to timely file a motion to vacate the judgment violated RPC 1.1 (competence) and RPC 1.3 (diligence). Hemmelgarn's failure to tell his client of the entry of the summary judgment and writ of garnishment violated RPC 1.4 (reasonably inform a client about case).Case 5 - In October 1990, Hemmelgarn was hired to defend a client who was being sued for breach of contract to purchase a mobile home, and to recover the client's down payment. The client, after agreeing to purchase the mobile home and making the down payment, refused to complete the purchase because the dealer failed to timely deliver the mobile home. After initially working on the case, Hemmelgarn failed to bring the matter to conclusion and failed to maintain communication with the client. Hemmelgarn's failure to pursue the client's lawsuit violated RPC 1.3 (diligence) and RPC 3.2 (reasonable efforts to expedite litigation). Hemmelgarn's failure to respond to the client's requests for information violated RPC 1.4 (reasonably inform client about case).Improper RepresentationCase 6 - Hemmelgarn, while an active member of the Oregon Bar, was hired, in January 1992, to defend a Washington client against her former husband's enforcement, in the state of Oregon, of an agreement in which, he claimed, the client had consented to forgive support arrearage in exchange for his consent to the adoption of their child by the client's present husband. Hemmelgarn was also to assert the client's claim for support arrearage. After the representation began, Hemmelgarn learned he was suspended from the Oregon Bar for nonpayment of dues. He told the client that he had been suspended but that he intended to be reinstated prior to the trial. He continued to represent the client and to bill the client for the work. On the day of trial, Hemmelgarn was still suspended. He faxed the client, who had been waiting for him to appear, that he could not represent the client at the trial and made suggestions about how the client could proceed with the trial alone. The client settled the matter on her own for a number of reasons, including Hemmelgarn's inability to appear on the client's behalf and the continued cost of litigation. Hemmelgarn's conduct in failing to timely withdraw from the case and his ongoing work for the client when he could not practice violated RPC 1.15 (duty to withdraw). By giving advice to the client in Oregon, when suspended from active membership in Oregon, Hemmelgarn violated RPC 5.5 (a) (prohibiting unauthorized practice of law) and RPC 8.4(d) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice). By seeking payment for services performed when he was suspended from active membership in the Oregon bar, Hemmelgarn violated RPC 1.5 (charging an unreasonable fee). As part of the stipulation, Hemmelgarn has agreed to make restitution to the clients of fees collected during the time he was suspended from the Oregon bar.Misconduct in Criminal MattersCases 7 and 8 - While representing different clients during 1991 and 1992 in various criminal matters in district and superior court cases, Hemmelgarn was late to court or failed to appear. Hemmelgarn's tardiness or failure to appear at several district court and superior court hearings violated RPC 1.3 (diligence) and RPC 8.4(d) (conduct prejudicial to administration of justice).Case 9 - While representing a client in a criminal case. Hemmelgarn, in November 1991, signed an indemnitor's agreement to ensure the client's appearance in court. By signing an indemnitor's agreement with a bonding company on behalf of a client, Hemmelgarn gave improper financial assistance to a client and gained a financial interest in the litigation, which violated RPC 1.8(c) (financial assistance to client during litigation) and RPC 1.7(b) (representing client when representation may be limited by lawyer's own interests).Prior to reinstatement, Hemmelgarn must demonstrate he is physically and mentally fit to practice law, and make restitution as stated above. Upon reinstatement, Hemmelgarn will be on probation for two years.Hemmelgarn represented himself. Disciplinary counsel Maria Regimbal and Christopher Sutton represented the Bar Association.

Hoss (WSBA No. 12976, admitted 1982), of Shelton, received two reprimands based on a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board on March 8, 2002. The discipline is based on his directing a family member to assist a client in signing a will.In the 1980s, Mr. Hoss regularly advised the Js regarding personal matters and their residential development, golf course and resort. Prior to 1990, Mr. Hoss performed estate-planning work for the Js. Sometime after this, Ms. J contacted another lawyer and executed a new will. On January 25, 1990, Ms. J was in the hospital in deteriorating condition. Mr. Hoss met with Ms. J with one of her three daughters present. Following this meeting, Mr. Hoss prepared a new will for Ms. J.On January 29, Mr. Hoss, his secretary, two of the daughters, Ms. Jâ€™s doctor and a nurse entered Ms. Jâ€™s room for the purpose of executing the new will. The witnesses dispute whether or not Ms. J was comatose. After reading the will to Ms. J, Mr. Hoss directed one of the daughters to take Ms. Jâ€™s hand and make an ""X."" Mr. Hoss asked the doctor and nurse to sign witness statements without explaining the legal effect of these statements. Ms. J died within four hours of her signature being placed on the new will. Although the new will was admitted to probate, Mr. J refused to honor the bequests made to the daughters.Mr. Hossâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.1, requiring lawyers to competently represent their clients; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; and 8.4(d), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.Maria Regimbal and Jean McElroy represented the Bar Association.

351.html,17080,Sharon Bartu,,Disbarment,3/13/2002,,"Sharon Bartu (WSBA No. 17080, admitted 1987), of Vancouver, was disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective March 13, 2002, following a default hearing. This discipline is based on her failing to diligently and competently represent two clients, charging unreasonable fees, and making misleading statements about her services in 1998.Matter 1: In 1998, Ms. Bartu agreed to represent a husband and wife (Mr. and Mrs. J) and the husbandâ€™s brother (FJ) in becoming residents of the United States and obtaining green cards. Mr. J paid Ms. Bartu $3,900 and FJ paid her $2,600. In November and December 1998, Ms. Bartu filed a cancellation of removal pleading for the clients. This pleading requested relief that is only available to aliens after a charging document has been filed with the immigration court by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), vesting jurisdiction in the immigration court. The INS had not filed charges against Ms. Bartuâ€™s clients, so filing this pleading had no effect on the clientsâ€™ immigration proceedings. Ms. Bartuâ€™s office filed an application to renew all three clientsâ€™ employment authorization cards, but Ms. Bartu took no further action on the clientsâ€™ cases.Matter 2: In 1998, Ms. Bartu agreed to assist an Iranian citizen in obtaining permanent residency status in the United States. The client, whose student-visa status had expired in 1997, paid Ms. Bartu $3,000. In October 1998, Ms. Bartu filed an application for cancellation of removal. The relief requested in this application is available only after deportation proceedings have begun; however, the client had not been placed in deportation proceedings. Ms. Bartu took the client on a tour of the immigration court in Portland, then took no further action on the clientâ€™s case.In early 2000, the client contacted the INS and learned that Ms. Bartu had filed the wrong form. The client made an appointment with Ms. Bartu to discuss his case, but she failed to appear. The client asked that Ms. Bartu explain how she planned to proceed on his case, or return his money. She did not respond to his requests.Ms. Bartuâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.1, requiring lawyers to competently represent their clients; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.7, prohibiting lawyers from making misleading statements about their services; and 1.5(a), requiring lawyersâ€™ fees to be reasonable.

Getz (WSBA No. 17926, admitted 1980), of Everett, has been suspended for six months by order of the Supreme Court approving a stipulation, effective May 1, 2002. This discipline is based on his ex parte contact with one of the parties of a mandatory arbitration and the abuse of his position as arbitrator in 2000.Mr. Z, former husband of Ms. S, moved for lowered child support and the court ordered mandatory arbitration. Mr. Getz was the court-appointed arbitrator. At the conclusion of the hearing, Mr. Getz asked Ms. S to remain behind in his office.

The clientâ€™s wife had obtained a protective order limiting his visitation with their children. Mr. Clyne failed to appear for the clientâ€™s December 7, 1999 hearing. On the same day, the client signed pleadings to begin a dissolution proceeding. On December 14, Mr. Clyne told the client that the dissolution pleadings had been filed and that the mother would be served immediately. Later, the client told Mr. Clyne that he wanted a separation instead of a dissolution, and Mr. Clyne indicated that he would change the paperwork. The mother was served with a dissolution petition in March 2000, but Mr. Clyne did not file a petition for dissolution or a petition for separation.In March 2000, the client asked Mr. Clyne to file a motion for contempt against his wife for violation of the current parenting plan. Mr. Clyne told the client the contempt hearing was scheduled for April 4, 2000, so the client flew from California to Seattle to attend. When the client called to verify the time of the hearing, Mr. Clyne told him that the hearing date was not confirmed and the motion would have to be refiled, although Mr. Clyne actually filed the motion on April 4, 2000.Suspension matter 2: In March 2000, Mr. Clyne agreed to represent a client in a family-law mediation.

At the hearing, the client was found in contempt of court and sanctioned $1,000. Mr. Clyne prepared a motion for revision, but missed the 10-day deadline for filing the motion. The client requested that Mr. Clyne send a letter to opposing counsel regarding therapy for her child, but Mr. Clyne did not send the letter. The client retained substitute counsel.Mr. Clyneâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep their clients reasonably informed of the status of their matters; and 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct involving misrepresentation.Disbarment: On May 27, 1998, Dr. E contacted a law firm (the firm) for assistance with an ongoing domestic-relations dispute. Mr. Clyne was the lawyer directly responsible for representing Dr. E. Between May 1998 and March 1999, Dr. E made seven fee deposits to the firm totaling $5,000, which were deposited into the firmâ€™s trust account. Advanced fees were drawn from the trust account as services were provided. As of May 5, 1999, Dr. E had a trust account balance of $220.71.

Mr. Clyne deposited the check into his personal account. In September 1999, Dr. E requested a $1,000 refund from Mr. J, the partner who handled billing inquiries. Mr. J found no record of a deposit and asked Dr. E to forward a copy of the canceled check. On September 23 or 24, Mr. J told Mr. Clyne about the inquiry, and Mr. Clyne made no comment about the check. On September 27, Mr. Clyne submitted his resignation to the firm.On or about September 28, 1999, Dr. E faxed Mr. J a copy of the canceled check with a note. Mr. J was on vacation from September 25 through 29. When he returned, he noted there was no fax from Dr. E, as expected. During the week of October 1, 1999, Mr. J asked Mr. Clyne about Dr. Eâ€™s inquiry and Mr. Clyne responded that it ""had been taken care of,"" that Dr. E was mistaken about sending a check, and that the trust account records were correct.On October 5, Mr. Clyne forwarded a check for $1,000 to Dr. E, written on his personal account. On October 6, Mr. J received a call from Dr. E about his money. Mr. J passed the phone to Mr. Clyne, who told Dr. E that it had been ""taken care of."" Following the telephone conversation, Mr. Clyne told Mr. J that Dr. E wanted to transfer his remaining firm trust-account funds to the departing Mr. Clyne; however, Dr. E had not indicated such a desire to anyone. The firm transferred the remaining $212.91 to Mr. Clyne, who deposited it into his trust account.In mid-October, Mr. Clyneâ€™s check to Dr. E bounced. On October 16, not realizing Mr. Clyne had left the firm, Dr. E sent an e-mail about the bounced check to the firm. On October 18, Mr. J responded to the e-mail by calling Dr. E. Mr. J requested copies of the September 28, 1999 fax and Mr. Clyneâ€™s October 5, 1999 personal check. After reviewing these documents, Mr. J forwarded two checks to Dr. E for the $1,000 deposit and the $212.91 balance. On October 23, Mr. Clyne telephoned Dr. E to discuss representation in the ongoing case. Dr. E told Mr. Clyne that he would continue to be represented by the firm. Dr. E never negotiated the checks from the firm, because Mr. Clyne subsequently reimbursed Dr. E for those amounts.Mr. Clyneâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 8.4(b), prohibiting lawyers from committing crimes which reflect adversely on a lawyersâ€™ honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer; 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; and 1.14, requiring lawyers to deposit all client funds paid to them in a trust account.Linda Eide represented the Bar Association.

Bierlein was also ordered to pay costs and expenses associated with his disciplinary proceedings, in the amount of $9,961.69.The disciplinary proceedings were based on Bierlein's actions in representing seven clients while he was an associate at a law firm. In one client's case, Bierlein endorsed a settlement check, deposited it to his personal account, attempted to disburse the settlement amount to the client, and attempted to keep, without authorization or entitlement, the legal fees due to his employer.In the second client's case, Bierlein endorsed a $50,000 settlement check, deposited it to his personal account, and listed the funds as a personal asset in his residential loan application and stated in the loan application process that such funds represented respondent's earlier fees. Bierlein submitted false information and made false statements to disciplinary counsel when questioned regarding the relationship of his residential loan application and the funds.In the third client's case, Bierlein endorsed a settlement check, deposited it to his personal account, and disbursed the funds to the client. He failed to maintain complete contemporaneous written records upon his receipt and disbursal of the settlement.In the fourth and fifth clients' cases, Bierlein personally collected the 1/3 contingent fee due to his employer from the clients' settlements and failed to maintain complete contemporaneous written records upon his receipt and disbursal of these settlements.In the sixth client's case, Bierlein endorsed a settlement check, deposited it to his personal account, and disbursed funds to the client and to his employer. He failed to maintain complete contemporaneous written records upon his receipt and disbursal of the settlement.In the seventh clientâ€™s case, Bierlein endorsed a settlement check, deposited it to his to his personal account, disbursed the settlement amount to the client and then appropriated the legal fees due to his employer without authorization or entitlement.Bierlein's actions violated the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPCs) as follows: misappropriating the firm's fees and listing the client settlement as a personal asset violated RPC 8.4(c), which prohibits conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; commingling client funds in his personal account and failing to maintain complete contemporaneous written records violated RPC 1.14; failing to provide written settlement statements to clients violated RPC 1.5; and, providing false information and statements to Disciplinary Counsel violated Rule of Lawyer Discipline 2.8 which requires a lawyer to make full and complete responses to the Association.

362.html,26511,Paul White,,Suspension,12/20/2001,,"Paul White aka Krishan Kumar (WSBA No. 26511, admitted 1996), of Tukwila, was suspended for 30 days by order of the Supreme Court approving a stipulation, effective December 20, 2001. This discipline is based on his failure to represent a client diligently and competently, and on making a false statement of material fact to a tribunal. (Note: Mr. White is to be distinguished from Paul J. White of Golden, Colorado; WSBA No. 11585.)In March 1997, Mr. White agreed to represent two clients who were plaintiffs in a personal-injury lawsuit. Prior to Mr. Whiteâ€™s involvement, the clients filed a lawsuit in King County Superior Court and each received a $10,298 arbitration award. The defendantâ€™s counsel appealed the arbitration award and trial was set for May 24, 1997. The order setting the trial date indicated that no further continuances would be granted for plaintiffsâ€™ lack of counsel.At this time, Mr. White had been admitted to the Washington State Bar Association for four months, had never tried a case in King County Superior Court, and was not familiar with superior court practice. Mr. White did not conduct any additional discovery prior to the trial date. He did not know that the clients had received the earlier arbitration award or that the defendants had appealed that award. Mr. White did not investigate the clientâ€™s history of numerous prior automobile accidents. Mr. White did not subpoena any witnesses for trial, including the clientâ€™s treating physician, nor did he interview any of the defenseâ€™s 65 witnesses. He did not file a trial brief, prepare jury instructions, or review the local court rules.When the parties arrived for trial, the clerk told them that the case would not go to trial that day. Mr. White told opposing counsel that he needed to continue the case because he had a criminal matter in California on June 3 and 4, 1997. In reality, Mr. White and a client had an INS appointment regarding a business matter. As part of the business matter, Mr. Whiteâ€™s client would undergo a criminal background check. On June 3, the clerk informed Mr. White that the trial would be heard on June 4. Mr. White filed a motion for continuance of the trial date.In the supporting affidavit, Mr. White stated that he would be in California for a ""criminal investigation related to a federal matter."" Mr. White also stated that he had been in Chicago on May 28 to attend a criminal matter. Although he planned to go to Chicago, he advised his client to find another lawyer, because he needed to stay in Seattle to wait for the trial to start. Mr. White did not appear for trial on June 4. The client appeared with a paralegal, and the judge ordered that the case go forward. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants.Mr. Whiteâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 4.1 and 3.3, prohibiting lawyers from making false statements of material fact; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; and 1.1, requiring lawyers to competently represent their clients.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

363.html,27321,Daniel Rodriguez,,Disbarment,6/19/2002,,"Daniel J. Rodriguez (WSBA No. 27321, admitted 1997), of Tacoma, was disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective June 19, 2002, following a hearing. This discipline is based on his committing acts of moral turpitude, lack of diligence, and charging unreasonable fees to clients.Matter 1: In March 2000, Mr. P retained Mr. Rodriguez to represent him in a criminal appeal, paying Mr. Rodriguez $4,000. On June 30, 2000, Mr. Rodriguez filed a notice of appeal on behalf of Mr. P. Mr. Rodriguez did not pay the filing fee, nor did he file a request for an order of indigency.On August 7, 2000, Mr. Rodriguez filed a motion to extend the deadline to submit the filing fee or to file a request for an order of indigency. On August 15, 2000, the court of appeals granted an extension of time to August 21, 2001. On that date, Mr. Rodriguez filed a letter with the court of appeals stating that he would file a motion for an order of indigency, but he did not do so, nor did he pay the filing fee. Mr. Rodriguez failed to inform Mr. P that he had neither paid the filing fee nor requested an order of indigency.On October 12, 2000, the Court of Appeals determined the appeal had been abandoned and remanded the case back to Kitsap County. Mr. Rodriguez did not refund any of the $4,000 to Mr. P, and failed to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation.Matter 2: In or about the spring and summer of 1999 and in August 2000, Mr. Rodriguez engaged in sexual contact and sexual intercourse, as those terms are defined by law, with ST. This conduct violated RCW 9A.44.079 (rape of a child in the third degree) and RCW 9A.44.089 (child molestation in the third degree). In January 2001, the Pierce County prosecutor charged Mr. Rodriguez with three counts of child rape and three counts of child molestation in the third degree. Mr. Rodriguez did not respond to the notice and summons for his arraignment on January 31, 2001. After a warrant was issued for his arrest, he left the area. On January 29, 2001, Mr. Rodriguez was asked to respond to a grievance regarding these criminal charges, but failed to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation.Matter 3: Mr. Rodriguez represented GE in a civil rights case set for trial on January 22, 2001. Mr. Rodriguez did not timely file several required pretrial pleadings, including jury instructions and a trial brief. The court issued a number of orders requiring Mr. Rodriguezâ€™s client to file specific pleadings by certain dates. Mr. Rodriguez did not comply fully with these orders. In February 2001, the court dismissed GEâ€™s case for failure to prepare for trial.Matter 4: Mr. Rodriguez represented JE in an appeal of a criminal conviction. On January 30, 2001, the court dismissed the appeal ""as it appears to have been abandoned."" The dismissal resulted from Mr. Rodriguezâ€™s failure to pay a sanction required by court order for late filing of clerk papers.Mr. Rodriguezâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to act with reasonable diligence; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters; 1.5, requiring lawyersâ€™ fees to be reasonable; 3.2, requiring lawyers to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation; and 8.4(d), which states it is professional misconduct for lawyers to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; RLD 2.8(a), requiring lawyers to promptly respond to any inquiry or request made pursuant to the rules for information relevant to a grievance; RCW 9A.44.079, rape of a child in the third degree; and RCW 9A.44.089, child molestation in the third degree.Anne Seidel represented the Bar Association.

37.html,136,Jennings Felix,,Disbarment,6/19/2001,,"Jennings P. Felix (WSBA No. 136, admitted 1948), of Seattle, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective June 19, 2001, following a hearing. The discipline is based upon his failure to promptly deliver client funds in a 1995 personal-injury case, and lack of diligence in an estate matter between 1993 and 1998.Matter 1: In 1993, Mr. Felix agreed to represent two passengers injured in an automobile accident. Mr. Felix and the clients signed a contingent-fee agreement stating Mr. Felix would receive 33.33 percent of the gross recovery if the case settled. In November 1995, Mr. Felix received settlement checks of $17,000 for client A and $125,000 for client B. In December 1995, Mr. Felix disbursed $35,820.50 of client Bâ€™s settlement to the client, $25,000 to himself, and $12,500 to his partner. In March 1996, he sent client B an additional $1,756.27 based on an error in calculating costs. In May 1996, Mr. Felix sent another $5,000 to client B and paid himself another $5,000. In June 1996, Mr. Felix paid himself $10,000 from client Bâ€™s settlement. The next month, he sent the client an additional $10,000. In September 1996, Mr. Felix withdrew $8,000 from client Bâ€™s settlement for himself and the client. Mr. Felix and his firm received a total of $60,500, or 48.4 percent of client Bâ€™s settlement.In December 1995, Mr. Felix sent $8,223.60 to client A and $4,800 to Mr. Felixâ€™s firm. For both clients A and B, Mr. Felix withheld funds for possible reimbursement to the insurance company, indicating that he was retaining funds in case the insurance company wanted him to pay it back. He told the clients he would try to negotiate less, and that he would keep half of the difference; however, this was not in his fee agreement. For client B, Mr. Felix withheld $31,366.55 for amounts the insurance company paid directly to health providers under the clientâ€™s own PIP coverage. He also withheld an additional $17,000 for car repairs, even though the car repairs were paid by another insurance company. Mr. Felix withheld these amounts in addition to the costs and $3,303 ""owed to State Farm."" Mr. Felix told client B that he had received letters on these issues from the insurance company, but upon request, did not provide copies to the client.As of the date of the hearing, no subrogation claims had been made for any amounts paid for clients A or B. At hearing, Mr. Felix testified that he believed he needed to hold back the funds in case the insurer attempted to collect those amounts from him under the hold-harmless agreement. He also testified that he could not recall any time when an insurance company had attempted to collect from him under such an agreement. The client eventually called State Farm (Insurance) and learned that the company did not intend to request reimbursement.Matter 2: Mr. Felix drafted a will for an employee, naming himself both executor and trustee. The will was admitted to probate in March 1993. Mr. Felix never filed an inventory or made annual accountings.In April 1997, because the file was still open, the court directed Mr. Felix to close the estate, file an explanation of why the estate had not been closed, or appear on May 29, 1997 to explain the file status. Mr. Felix did not comply with this order. He was sick during this time and obtained several continuances.On January 14, 1998, the court appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) for the clientâ€™s son. On March 11, 1998, the court ordered that the estate assets be transferred to the GAL. Mr. Felix failed to transfer the assets. On April 10, the court removed Mr. Felix as personal representative and trustee, and entered a $65,000 judgment against him.Mr. Felixâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.5(a), requiring lawyersâ€™ fees to be reasonable; 1.5(c)(1), requiring contingent fees to be in writing; 1.14(b)(4), requiring lawyers to promptly pay client funds upon request; 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving honesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; and 3.4(c), requiring lawyers to comply with court orders.Linda Eide represented the Bar Association.

Mr. Tassano did not admit or stipulate to the facts in the stipulation, but  agreed that at a disciplinary hearing, the WSBA would be able to prove that between July 1998 and December 2000, he used his employerâ€™s funds to make personal purchases.In 1994, Mr. Tassano established the Washington Appellate Project (WAP).  WAP provides representation for indigent appellants in criminal cases.  Mr. Tassano was employed as the Executive Director of the WAP from 1994 until July 2001, when he resigned.  Between July 8, 1998 and December 28, 2000, Mr. Tassano issued six checks from the WAP account totaling $16,218.72, payable to a camera supply store.  In November and December 2000, Mr. Tassano issued two checks from the WAP account totaling $6,008.82, to a computer store.

38.html,13979,Donald Kronenberg,,Suspension,3/1/2001,,"Donald B. Kronenberg (WSBA No.13979, admitted 1984), of Seattle, has been suspended for six months effective March 1, 2001, by order of the Supreme Court dated November 30, 2000. This discipline is based on his charging an unreasonable fee and failing to properly account for client funds in one matter, and engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice and filing a frivolous claim in another.Matter 1: On August 18, 1987, Mr. Kronenberg agreed to collect back-due child support for a client on a contingent-fee basis. The fee agreement stated that Mr. Kronenberg would receive 50 percent of all sums recovered before the deduction of advanced costs and expenses. In October 1987, Mr. Kronenberg also agreed to represent the client in a custody modification matter on an hourly fee basis. The client moved several times during the representation, at times living in Nevada and at other times, California. The clientâ€™s sister always lived in Federal Way, and Mr. Kronenberg knew or should have known that he could contact the client through her sister, since Mr. Kronenberg met with the sister at the beginning of the representation.On January 15, 1988, Mr. Kronenberg obtained a $27,868 judgment for back support. He immediately began garnishing the debtorâ€™s wages and, in October 1988, received a $1,164 check. He notified the client that he had received the check and indicated he would apply the amount to his fees. Mr. Kronenberg received six additional garnishment checks totaling $7,196.93. He deposited these checks into his general business account instead of his client trust account. He did not send the client copies of these checks or the garnishment pleadings. Mr. Kronenberg did not send the client any bills reflecting the amounts collected in the garnishments. Mr. Kronenberg applied all of the amounts collected on the judgment to his fees, without the clientâ€™s permission.In December 1989, the custody matter settled with the father agreeing to enter into a voluntary $500 per month wage assignment, with $400 per month allocated to back support and $100 as current support.In January 1990, Mr. Kronenberg received a $500 payment on the wage assignment. He kept the $400 back-due child support portion and mailed the $100 payment to the client. The check was returned because the client had moved. Mr. Kronenberg asked his staff to look in the phone book for the clientâ€™s new address, and then applied the $100 to his fees when he could not locate her. He did not attempt to contact her sister to find a current address.From August 1987 through October 1988, Mr. Kronenberg sent the client a combined monthly statement for both matters. On November 15, 1988, he set up a separate internal billing statement for the back-support matter, which reflected that the client owed him $14,215.68 (50 percent of the judgment amount), less the $1,163.09 already received. Each month he generated a new internal billing reflecting a larger balance due from the client for garnishment costs, or a smaller balance reflecting garnishment payments, charging the client a compounded interest rate of up to 1.6 percent on the ""unpaid balance.""In 1992, the client learned of the additional garnishments after looking at the court file. When she confronted Mr. Kronenberg, he first denied receiving any funds, and then stated that he was entitled to keep all of the funds until he had collected 50 percent of the judgment amount.Matter 2: In November 1990, Mr. Kronenberg agreed to assist a client whose claim had been denied by the Crime Victimsâ€™ Compensation Program administered by the Department of Labor and Industries (L&I). The client had been involved in a shooting in Seattle in 1989. On August 15, 1990, L&I awarded the client $15,000 on his claim, to be paid in two or three installments. In October 1991, L& I sent $8,987.52 to Mr. Kronenberg. Mr. Kronenberg kept one third, plus costs, and forwarded $5,901.58 to the client.Later that month, the client contacted L& I directly and asked to pick up the balance of his award at their office in Olympia. L&I agreed, so long as the client provided a handwritten note stating that Mr. Kronenberg no longer represented him. The client wrote the note and included a statement that he was relocating in approximately two weeks to the Midwest. The clientâ€™s father, who lived near the L&I office, delivered the note and picked up the $6,012.48 payment. Mr. Kronenberg did not receive his one-third fee from this portion of the payment.After Mr. Kronenberg learned that the payment had been made to the client directly, he contacted the father. Mr. Kronenberg told the father that he must pay for Mr. Kronenbergâ€™s lost fee. When the father objected, Mr. Kronenberg filed a lawsuit naming both the client and the father as respondents. Mr. Kronenberg also obtained a prejudgment writ of attachment on the fatherâ€™s home.Mr. Kronenberg stated in his declaration justifying the writ that the client, in conjunction with the father, had removed or were about to remove property from the state. Although Mr. Kronenberg admitted that the only basis for this statement was the sonâ€™s note, he refused to agree to remove the writ of attachment. The father paid $992, half the amount of the claim, to obtain a release of the writ. After the payment, Mr. Kronenberg did not take steps to dismiss the matter.Mr. Kronenbergâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep their clients informed of the status of their matters and to explain matters to the extent reasonably necessary for clients to make informed decisions; 1.14, requiring lawyers to deposit client funds into their trust accounts; 1.5, requiring lawyersâ€™ fees to be reasonable and to explain the basis for the fee to the client; 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; 3.1, prohibiting lawyers from bringing proceedings unless there is a nonfrivolous basis for doing so; 3.3, prohibiting knowingly making a false statement of material fact to a tribunal; and 8.4(d), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.Joy McLean represented the Bar Association.

The discipline was based on his violations of court orders and unjustified acts of assault between March 1998 and January 2000.In October 1998, Mr. Berkenmeier pleaded guilty to negligent driving in South Pacific District Court.  In December 1998, he pleaded guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia in Cowlitz District Court.

384.html,7370,Paul King,,Suspension,4/25/2002,,"Paul King (WSBA No7370, admitted 1977), of Seattle, was suspended for two years, effective April 25, 2002, by order of the Supreme Court approving a stipulation.  The discipline is based on his failure to follow a clientâ€™s instructions, failure to charge a reasonable fee, failure to properly administer his client trust account and failure to properly file and pay state and federal taxes from 1996 through 2000.Matter 1: In May 1998, Mr. King agreed to represent two clients in a wage claim against their former employer.  On October 1, 1999, opposing counsel made a settlement offer of $14,000.  The clients instructed Mr. King to accept the settlement offer.   On that same day, Mr. King wrote a letter to opposing counsel stating that he would not accept less than $17,500.  On October 7, 1999, after speaking with the clients, a member of Mr. Kingâ€™s staff told opposing counsel that the clients would accept the settlement offer.  On October 8, 1999, opposing counsel wrote a confirming letter and enclosed a copy of the settlement agreement.  The clients visited Mr. Kingâ€™s office that day, taking a copy of the settlement agreement and again instructing the office to accept the settlement.  On October 13, 1999, Mr. King sent opposing counsel a letter stating that the clients were proceeding to trial.  On October 15, 1999, opposing counsel received the signed settlement agreement directly from the clients.  When the settlement check arrived, Mr. King demanded 50% of the gross recovery, instead of the 40% stated in the fee agreement.  Mr. King told the clients that the check would remain in his trust account until the â€œfee disputeâ€ was resolved.  Worried they would never receive their money, the clients agreed to pay $6,918 in attorneyâ€™s fees.  The clients received  $6,293.72.Mr. Kingâ€™s conduct in this matter violated RPCs 1.2, requiring lawyers to abide by their clientsâ€™ decisions whether to accept an offer of settlement; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients informed of the status of their matters; 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct involving dishonestly, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; and 1.5, requiring lawyers fees to be reasonable.Matter 2: From January 1999 through May 2000, Mr. King used a credit union share account for his office checking account.  He used sub accounts of this share checking account for his client trust accounts.  During this time, Mr. King deposited client funds into his office checking account and paid clients from this account.  He did not maintain adequate records of client funds. Mr. Kingâ€™s non-lawyer assistants were responsible for most trust account transactions.  Mr. King did not provide proper training or supervision.Matter 3:  Mr. King employed a legal assistant, Mr. S.  In April 1999, Mr. S. accepted a $1000 cash payment from a client.  He placed this payment in the safe in Mr. Kingâ€™s Bremerton office, without any identification or written records.  When Mr. King learned of the payment, he made no efforts to identify the funds or create written records.  At some later date, the funds were removed from the safe.  Mr. King was not able to determine when the funds were removed.  Mr. Kingâ€™s conduct in these matters violated RPC 1.14, requiring lawyers to identify and label clientsâ€™ property and maintain complete records of client funds and property in the lawyerâ€™s possession.Tax Matters: Mr. King did not stipulate to the facts in these matters, but agreed that if they proceeded to a public hearing, there is a substantial likelihood that the Association would be able to prove these facts.  From 1996 through 2000, Mr. King failed to file returns and pay business and occupation tax to the Department of Revenue.  After the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) began the investigation, Mr. King filed the returns and paid the taxes and penalties.  During this same time period, Mr. King always employed at least one full-time non-lawyer assistant.  Mr. King knowingly failed to report his payroll amount to the Department of Labor and Industries.

385.html,24238,Hyon Pak,,Suspension,1/4/2008,,"Hyon Chun Pak (WSBA No. 24238, admitted 1994), of Tukwila, was suspended for one year, effective January 4, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct in two matters involving representing clients in a court where he was not admitted, failing to monitor clientsâ€™ cases and failing to act with reasonable diligence, failing to communicate, charging unreasonable fees, and failing to protect clientsâ€™ interests.Matter 1: In May 2003, a client hired Mr. Pak to file an appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in an immigration matter. The client did not speak English and communicated with Mr. Pak through an interpreter. The client paid Mr. Pak $2,000 when she hired him and later paid Mr. Pakâ€™s interpreter $3,000, which the interpreter turned over to Mr. Pak. Mr. Pak considered the funds he received from the client earned upon receipt and did not place them in a trust account. The client, however, did not understand or agree that Mr. Pak would treat the funds she provided him as earned upon receipt. Mr. Pak filed a petition for review on the clientâ€™s behalf with the Ninth Circuit in May 2003. He paid the filing fee of $250. Mr. Pak was not admitted to practice before the Ninth Circuit when he filed the petition. Shortly thereafter, the Ninth Circuit Clerkâ€™s office advised Mr. Pak that he needed to become admitted to that court or withdraw from representation. Mr. Pak began the process of becoming admitted to the Ninth Circuit but did not complete it, and did not withdraw from representing the client before the Ninth Circuit. The administrative record was filed in the clientâ€™s case in August 2003. Mr. Pak filed two motions for extension of time to file his appellate brief, which were granted, but he never filed the brief. The court dismissed the appeal in January 2004 for lack of prosecution. Mr. Pak did not monitor the status of the clientâ€™s case and never advised the client that her case had been dismissed. The client tried to contact Mr. Pak many times about the status of her case but generally was unable to reach him. The dismissal of the clientâ€™s case made her immediately eligible for deportation.In November 2005, the client hired a new lawyer to represent her in her appeal. The new lawyer contacted the Ninth Circuit and learned that the clientâ€™s case had been dismissed. He then tried repeatedly to contact Mr. Pak to obtain the clientâ€™s file and sent him a notice of withdrawal and substitution. Mr. Pak received the notice, but did not sign it or otherwise respond to the new lawyer because he was angry at the new lawyer for stealing his client. The new lawyer filed a motion to reopen the clientâ€™s appeal with the Ninth Circuit on grounds that Mr. Pak had provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The Ninth Circuit granted the motion and reinstated the appeal.Matter 2: In early 2004, a client hired Mr. Pak to file an appeal with Ninth Circuit in an immigration matter. The client did not speak English and communicated with Mr. Pak through an interpreter. The client paid Mr. Pak $3,000 to assist her in filing a brief with the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Pak considered the funds he received from the client earned upon receipt and did not place them in a trust account. The client, however, did not understand or agree that Mr. Pak would treat the funds she provided him as earned upon receipt. Mr. Pak filed a petition for review on the clientâ€™s behalf in April 2004 and paid the $250 filing fee. The petition indicated that it was filed by the client pro se, but listed Mr. Pakâ€™s address instead of hers so that the record and other correspondence would come to him. The administrative record was filed in July 2004. Mr. Pak took no action in the case. The court dismissed the appeal in September 2005 for lack of prosecution. Mr. Pak did not monitor the status of the clientâ€™s case. The client tried to contact him many times about the status of her case, but generally was unable to reach him. Mr. Pak never advised the client that her case had been dismissed. According to Mr. Pak, he did not realize that the case had been dismissed. The dismissal of the clientâ€™s case made her immediately eligible for deportation. In December 2005, the client hired a new lawyer to represent her in her appeal. The new lawyer contacted the Ninth Circuit and learned that the clientâ€™s case had been dismissed. The new lawyer tried repeatedly to contact Mr. Pak to obtain the clientâ€™s file and sent to him a notice of withdrawal and substitution. Mr. Pak received the notice of withdrawal and substitution but did not sign it or otherwise respond to the new lawyer because he was angry at him for stealing his client. The new lawyer filed a motion to reopen the clientâ€™s appeal with the Ninth Circuit on grounds that Mr. Pak had provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The Ninth Circuit granted the motion and ordered the case remanded to the Bureau of Immigration Appeals. Mr. Pakâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable; former RPC 1.15(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation will result in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law; former RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned; RPC 5.5(a), which prohibits lawyers from practicing law in a jurisdiction where doing so violates the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.Joanne S.

The effective date of the suspension is retroactive to September 11, 2000.  This discipline was based on his 2000 guilty plea to one count of filing a false tax return.On June 20, 2000, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington accepted Mr. Hessâ€™ guilty plea to one count of filing a false tax return, a felony.  The charge was based on Mr. Hess signing his 1992 individual tax return and schedules without examining them to determine that they were true, complete and correct.  Mr. Hessâ€™ signature on the return constituted a written declaration that he had, in fact, examined his returns and the schedules.  Mr. Hess had not examined the return and schedules.  The false statement involved was his declaration that he had examined the return and schedules.  Mr. Hess was interimly suspended on September 11, 2000.

In 1993, Atkins represented the victim of an alleged criminal assault. No civil action was filed; criminal charges were, however, brought against the alleged assailant. In the course of Atkinsâ€™ representation, he called both the alleged assailant and his appointed criminal lawyer. Atkins made statements to both individuals which were reasonably interpreted by them as an offer that, in exchange for money, the victim would make a statement that the incident was an accident and would not disclose her address to the prosecutors.

Grahn (WSBA No. 20312, admitted 1991), of Lakewood, was suspended for sixty days by order of the Supreme Court dated June 19, 2001approving a stipulation. This discipline is based on his practicing law while his license was suspended in 1999 and lack of diligence and communication with two clients in 1998.Matter 1: On July 19, 1999, the Supreme Court suspended Mr. Grahnâ€™s license to practice law for failing to comply with the Admission to Practice (APR) 11 duty to report Continuing Legal Education credits.  Although the Supreme Court notified Mr. Grahn of the suspension, he stated he did not receive this notification.  On August 19, 1999, an Office of Disciplinary Counsel investigator contacted Mr. Grahn in court, notified him of the suspension and provided him a copy of the court order.   Mr. Grahn knew of his duties to notify his clients of his suspension, but believed he did not have to comply because he would be reinstated quickly.  After completing his CLE requirements and paying the late fee, Mr. Grahn assumed that his license to practice law would be automatically reinstated to active status.  The Supreme Court reinstated Mr. Grahnâ€™s license to active status on September 8, 1999.  Mr. Grahn represented clients while his license to practice was suspended from July 19, 1999 through September 8, 1999.

Matter 2: In December 1997, Mr. Grahn agreed to represent the mother in an on-going marriage dissolution action.  The client gave Mr. Grahn her only copy of the scheduling order showing that trial was set for March 4, 1998.  Mr. Grahn requested a continuance, but the court denied the request.  Mr. Grahn did not meet with the client after mid-February and did not tell her when the trial would begin.  Neither Mr. Grahn nor the client appeared for the trial.  The client learned from her daughter that the trial had occurred and retained another lawyer to set aside the default.  Mr. Grahnâ€™s conduct in this matter violated RPC 1.4(a) requiring lawyers to keep clientsâ€™ reasonably informed of the status of their matters.  Matter 3: In November 1997, Mr. Grahn agreed to represent the father in a marital dissolution action.  After several hours, the clientâ€™s deposition was continued to September 9, 1998.  On September 8, 1998, Mr. Grahn notified opposing counsel that his client would not appear.  Opposing counsel noted a motion to compel the clientâ€™s attendance and impose sanctions.  Opposing counsel continued the motion at Mr. Grahnâ€™s request, but rescheduled for a date Mr. Grahn stated he would not be available.  The day prior to the motion hearing, Mr. Grahn sent a letter to opposing counsel and to the judge indicating he was not available for the motion.  Mr. Grahn did not file a response to the motion or formally request a continuance.  The court struck the clientâ€™s pleadings and imposed $975 in attorneyâ€™s fees.  Opposing counsel then filed a motion for an order of default.  Mr. Grahn appeared and orally requested that the judge reconsider his earlier order striking the clientâ€™s pleadings.

The courtâ€™s order conditions Ms. Jarvillâ€™s reinstatement upon paying restitution of $505,000. The discipline is based upon her use of estate proceeds for her personal use without the knowledge or permission of the co-personal representative.Ms. Jarvillâ€™s uncle died in January 1995. Ms. Jarvillâ€™s first cousins, who lived in Oklahoma, were the beneficiaries of his estate. The estate retained two lawyers to pursue a substantial corporate issue. During the case, one cousin asked Ms. Jarvillâ€™s opinion and advice about the lawsuit and a $600,000 settlement offer.

This discipline is based on his disclosing a clientâ€™s confidences, failure to avoid conflicts of interest, making misrepresentations to the court and splitting fees with a non-lawyer in 1992 through 1996.  The sanction in this case was affected by significant mitigating factors.In September 1992, Mr. Pratum agreed to represent a client arrested by the South King County Drug Enforcement Task Force.  Prior to contacting Mr. Pratum, the client indicated that he was willing to be a confidential informant in exchange for leniency from the police.  Mr. Pratum briefly met the client outside the police station prior to a meeting with a detective.  During the meeting, the detective provided the client an agreement form setting out the agreement between the client and the police.  Mr. Pratum and the detective negotiated changes to the wording of the agreement.  During this meeting, the detective mentioned names of suspected drug dealers who were targets of police investigations.  The police asked the client to provide information regarding these suspected drug dealers.  Mr. Pratum represented one of the suspected dealers identified by the detective.  Mr. Pratum called the suspected dealer and told him of his clientâ€™s confidential informant deal and that the police were investigating the dealer.  The client testified that almost immediately after leaving the police station, he began receiving threats, both in person and by telephone.

Carmick (WSBA No. 11365, admitted 1980), of Chehalis, was suspended for sixty days by order of the Supreme Court, effective July 10, 2002.  This discipline was based on his lack of candor with the court and communication with a represented party in 1994 and 1995.  For further information please see the published Supreme Court opinion.In July 1994, Mr. Carmick agreed to represent the father in negotiations for interest payments on a judgment for past due child support under URESA.  The court granted a $15,037.40 judgment in 1985.  The father paid the face amount  of the judgment, but interest was still owing.  In June 1994, the father contacted the Lewis County Prosecutorâ€™s office to find out the amount then owing. The prosecutor calculated the amount as $11,000, but the father believed the correct amount was lower.  The prosecutor agreed to release the lien in exchange for the fatherâ€™s title company tendering $11,000 to the Lewis County Superior Court.  Mr. Carmick reviewed the court file.  Almost all of the pleadings in the court file referenced prosecutor B.  Instead of contacting prosecutor B, Mr. Carmick contacted the mother directly.  During this conversation, Mr. Carmick did not disclose that $11,000 had been deposited with the court.  Additionally, Mr. Carmick told the mother that neither of the prosecutors she was working with were available.  Both prosecutors later testified that they were available.  In July 1994, Mr. Carmick sent the mother an offer to settle for $5,000.  He implied that she would have a difficult time collecting any more than this amount and directed her to sign and return to him the settlement agreement any documents she had received from the Prosecutorâ€™s Office.  On July 25, 1994, Mr. Carmick filed the signed settlement pleadings and a notice of appearance.  He did not serve the notice of appearance on the mother or the prosecutors working on the case.  In August, Mr. Carmick presented an ex-parte order disburing $6,000 to his client and $5,000 to the mother.  Mr. Carmick told the judge that the mother and prosecutor B approved the order.  The judge entered the order and the funds were disbursed.  Later,  prosecutor B learned of Mr. Carmickâ€™s actions and filed a motion to vacate the order based on fraud.  Mr. Carmick withdrew from the representation.  Mr. Carmickâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 3.3(f), requiring lawyers to inform the tribunal of all relevant facts the lawyer knows should be disclosed in ex-parte proceedings, to permit an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse; 3.5(b), prohibiting lawyers from communicating ex-parte with a judge, juror, perspective juror or other official except as permitted by law; and 4.2, prohibiting lawyers from communicating about the subject of the representation with a party the lawyer knows to be represented, without the other lawyerâ€™s consent.Jonathan Burke represented the Bar Association.

Mr. Alipuria filed the clientâ€™s lawsuit in federal court.  In May 1999, Mr. Alipuria demanded that the client meet him at his office the next day.  When the client arrived, Mr. Alipuria told the client they would be travelling to Seattle to answer questions for the opposing counsel.  Opposing counsel deposed the client for five hours.  Mr. Alipuria did not attend six witness depositions noted by opposing counsel.  On June 24, 1999, Mr. Alipuria received opposing counselâ€™s summary judgment motion.  On July 9, 1999, he contacted the client for phone numbers of potential declarants to support a response to the summary judgment.  Mr. Alipuria was not able to contact the witnesses prior to the time the response was due.  Although he prepared a response, he did not file it, because he could not contact the witnesses.

Mr. Alipuria told the client that the dissolution would be finalized on a date less than the required 90 days after service of the petition.  Then, he continued the hearing to February 10, 1999. Mr. Alipuria did not finalize the dissolution because he could not verify that the husband had been served.

Kimberly (WSBA No. 10666, admitted 1980), of Bellingham, received a reprimand based on a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board on March 29, 2001. The discipline is based upon his failure to comply with his criminal defendant clientâ€™s request to testify at a jury trial in 1995.In 1995, Mr. Kimberly defended a client against charges of rape in the second degree and unlawful imprisonment. Prior to trial, Mr. Kimberly suggested, and the client agreed, that the client would not testify in his own defense. During the trial, the court twice sanctioned and fined Mr. Kimberly for disrespect outside the presence of the jury.Initially, Mr. Kimberly decided to send an associate to present closing argument in the clientâ€™s case, but he appeared personally after the court ordered him to complete the case. When Mr. Kimberly returned to the courthouse, his client indicated that the client wanted to testify. The defense had rested, but closing argument had not yet been presented. Mr. Kimberly still believed that it would not be in his clientâ€™s best interest to testify, so did not move to re-open the evidence to allow the testimony. Mr. Kimberly then proceeded with closing argument.The jury found the client guilty as charged. The client obtained new counsel, who filed a motion for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Mr. Kimberly signed a supporting declaration admitting that the client had asked to testify, and that Mr. Kimberly had not presented the testimony; the court denied the motion. The court of appeals indicated that Mr. Kimberlyâ€™s conduct had fallen below the standard of care, but denied the clientâ€™s motion. In August 1999, the Washington Supreme Court granted the client an evidentiary hearing on the sufficiency of his defense at trial. After the hearing, the motion was denied.Mr. Kimberlyâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.2(a), requiring lawyers to abide by a clientâ€™s decision whether to testify in a criminal case.Leslie Allen represented the Bar Association.

Mr. Erikson did not advise the clients of the conflict of interest, nor obtain their written consent to continuation of the representation.  In August 2000, the associate who had worked on the clientâ€™s case left Mr. Eriksonâ€™s office and opened his own practice.  The associate settled the case.

Patrick Healy (WSBA No. 4835, admitted 1972), of Tacoma, was suspended for one year, following a stipulation to discipline, by order of the Supreme Court, effective January 22, 2003. This discipline is based on his conduct in several investment partnerships and corporations in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  In the early 1980s, Mr. Healy and Richard Butko began investing in real estate development ventures.  By the late 1980s, they began forming partnerships and corporations to manage these real estate ventures.  Mr. Butkoâ€™s mother, Ann, and Mr. Healyâ€™s brother Michael were involved in some of these corporations and partnerships. In early 1992, Mr. Healy and Mr. Butko encountered financial difficulties and loan default proceedings were begun.  Mr. Healy asked Mr. Butko to make capital contributions to the entities with property in default.  When Mr. Butko made no capital contributions, Mr. Healy, claiming to protect the corporate and partnership assets, extinguished the Butkosâ€™ interests.  Mr. Healy took many actions to accomplish this goal over the next two years.  In several cases, Mr. Healy prepared resolutions purporting to transfer property, dissolve corporations or forfeit the Butkosâ€™ interest in property.  These resolutions stated that they had been unanimously approved by the shareholders.  In fact, Mr. Butko and sometimes Ms. Butko voted against these resolutions.  In other cases, Mr. Healy prepared partnership resolutions, even though he did not have a majority interest.  	In 1993, Richard and Anne Butko sued Mr. Healy under separate cause numbers.  Anne Butkoâ€™s claim was resolved in arbitration with a judgment in her favor for $103,000.  The Court granted Mr. Butko an award of 2.4 million dollars.  These lawsuits restored the Butkosâ€™ interests in seven of the nine partnerships and corporations.

Mr. Warner entered into a personal and sexual relationship with the client, while continuing to represent her until he resigned from his firm in May 1998.

430.html,21556,Richard Clyne,,Suspension,3/13/2002,,"Richard K. Clyne (WSBA No. 21556, admitted 1992), of Seattle, was suspended for two years by order of the Supreme Court on March 13, 2002 following a hearing, and then disbarred effective June 19, 2002, following a second hearing. This discipline is based on his misappropriation of funds, his engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation and failure to deposit client funds into a trust account from 1997 to 1999, and failure to diligently represent clients from 1999 through 2000. Suspension Case Matter 1: In August 1999, Mr. Clyne agreed to represent the father in a parenting plan modification matter. The clientâ€™s wife had obtained a protective order limiting his visitation with the children. Mr. Clyne failed to appear for the clientâ€™s December 7, 1999 hearing. On this same day, the client signed pleadings to begin a dissolution proceeding. On December 14, 1999, Mr. Clyne told the client that the dissolution pleadings had been filed and that the mother would be served immediately. Later the client told Mr. Clyne that he wanted a separation instead of a dissolution. Mr. Clyne indicated that he would change the paperwork.. The mother was served with a dissolution petition in March 2000. Mr. Clyne did not file a petition for dissolution or a petition for separation. In March 2000, the client asked Mr. Clyne to file a motion for contempt against his wife for violation of the current parenting plan. Mr. Clyne told the client the contempt hearing was scheduled for April 4, 2000, so the client flew from California to Seattle to attend. When the client called to verify the time for the hearing, Mr. Clyne told him that the hearing date was not confirmed and the motion would have to be re-filed. Mr. Clyne actually filed the motion on April 4, 2000. Suspension Case Matter 2: In March 2000, Mr. Clyne agreed to represent a client in a family law mediation. The parties did not reach agreement at the mediation and the opposing party set a Superior Court hearing for May 25, 2000. On the day of the hearing, Mr. Clyne told the client that the date had been changed to June 7, 2000. On the day prior to the hearing, the client called Mr. Clyne to review her response, but Mr. Clyne did not have it prepared. At the hearing, the client was found in contempt of court and sanctioned $1,000. Mr. Clyne prepared a motion for revision, but missed the 10-day deadline for filing the motion. The client requested that Mr. Clyne send a letter to opposing counsel regarding therapy for the child. Mr. Clyne did not send the letter. The client retained substitute counsel. Mr. Clyneâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep their clients reasonably informed of the status of their matters; and 8.4(c) prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct involving misrepresentation. Disbarment: On May 27, 1998, Dr. E. contacted a law firm (â€œthe firmâ€) for assistance with an ongoing domestic relations dispute. Mr. Clyne was the lawyer directly responsible for representing Dr. E. Between May 1998 and March 1999, Dr. E made seven fee deposits to the firm in a total amount of $5,000, which were deposited into their trust account. Advanced fees were drawn down from the trust account as services were provided. As of May 5, 1999, Dr. E had a trust account balance of $220.71. No further time entries were made by Mr. Clyne on Dr. Eâ€™s case. A September 7, 1999, statement reflected a small photocopy charge and an adjusted balance of $212.91 On or about May 24, 1999, Dr. E forwarded a $1, 000 check payable to Mr. Clyne for an advance fee deposit. Mr. Clyne deposited the check into his personal account. In September 1999, Dr. E requested refund of the $1, 000 from Mr. J, the partner who handles billing inquiries. Mr. J found no record of a deposit and asked Dr. E to forward a copy of the canceled check. On September 23 or 24, 1999. Mr. J told Mr. Clyne about the inquiry and Mr. Clyne made no comment about the check. On September 27, 1999, Mr. Clyne submitted his resignation to GF&J. On or about September 28, 1999, Dr. E faxed Mr. J a copy of the canceled check with a note. Mr. J was on vacation from September 25 through 29 and when he returned, he noted there was no fax from Dr. E as expected. During the week of October 1, 1999, Mr. J asked Mr. Clyne about Dr. Eâ€™s inquiry and Mr. Clyne responded that it â€œhad been taken care ofâ€, that Dr. E was mistaken about sending a check and that the trust account records were correct. On October 5, 1999, Mr. Clyne forwarded a check for $1,000 to Dr. E, written on his personal account. On October 6, 1999, Mr. J received a call from Dr. E about his money. Mr. J passed the phone to Mr. Clyne who told Dr. E that it had been â€œtaken care ofâ€. Following the telephone conversation, Mr. Clyne told Mr. J that Dr. E wanted to transfer his remaining firm trust account funds to the departing Mr. Clyne. Dr. E had not indicated such a desire to anyone. The firm transferred the remaining $212.91 to Mr. Clyne, who deposited it into his trust account. In mid-October, Mr. Clyneâ€™s check to Dr. E bounced. On October 16, 1999, not realizing Mr. Clyne had left the firm, Dr. E sent an e-mail about the bounced check to the firm. On October 18, 1999 Mr. J responded to the e-mail by calling Dr. E. Mr. J requested copies of the September 28, 1999 fax and Mr. Clyneâ€™s October 5, 1999 personal check. After reviewing these documents, Mr. J forwarded two checks to Dr. E for the $1,000 deposit and $212.91 balance. On October 23, 1999, Mr. Clyne telephoned Dr. E to discuss representation in the ongoing case. Dr. E told Mr. Clyne that he would continue to be represented by the firm. Dr. E never negotiated the checks from the firm, because Mr. Clyne subsequently reimbursed Dr. E for those amounts. Mr. Clyneâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 8.4(b), prohibiting lawyers from committing crimes which reflects adversely on the lawyersâ€™ honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer; 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; and 1.14, requiring a lawyer to deposit all client funds paid to the lawyer in a trust account.

434.html,22275,Robert Lyons,,Disbarment,11/19/2002,,"Robert C. Lyons (WSBA No. 22275, admitted 1992), of Tacoma, was disbarred, following two separate hearings, by order of the Supreme Court, effective November 19, 2002. This discipline is based on conflicts of interest, dishonesty and criminal conduct from 1994 through 2000.Matter 1: In 1995, Mr. Lyons agreed to represent a client in a marital dissolution.  During the first meeting, Mr. Lyons suggested that the client work for an escort service to earn extra money.  Mr. Lyons called the client repeatedly for three months, asking if she would have an affair with him.  The client began cooperating with the Tacoma Police Department by allowing a phone tap and wearing a microphone and transmitter.  During these conversations, Mr. Lyons asked the client to perform oral sex and suggested that he should â€œtry her outâ€ and then provide a reference to his friend at the escort service.  Mr. Lyons fondled the client when she tried to leave his office.  The conversation ended with Mr. Lyons paying the client for her agreement to have sex with him. When the media coverage of this matter aired, several other women reported similar conduct to the Tacoma Police Department.Matter 2: In March 2000, Mr. Lyons agreed to represent Mr. and Ms. C. in a personal injury action based on a 1999 automobile accident. In December, Mr. Lyons told Mr. C that the insurance company was only willing to pay $1,100.  The client agreed to this settlement amount, so long as he received the money before Christmas.  On December 18, 2000, the insurance company issued a $2,250 settlement check to Mr. C and Mr. Lyons.  Mr. Lyons deposited the check into his trust account without the clientâ€™s signature.  In March 2000, Mr. Lyons closed his office, without disbursing any of the settlement funds to Mr. C.  Mr. Lyons took no action on Ms. Câ€™s case.  The driverâ€™s insurance company paid Mr. C. his portion of the settlement, even though the company had paid this amount earlier to Mr. Lyons.  Matter 3: In January 2000, Mr. Lyons agreed to provide pro bono representation to clients of a womenâ€™s shelter.  In early December 2000, Mr. Lyons began representing a shelter client whose parental rights were apparently being terminated.  Mr. Lyons told the client the representation would cost $100   per month.  On December 27, 2000, during a meeting at the clientâ€™s home, Mr. Lyons discussed his personal problems, pretended to be emotional and asked the client to give him a hug.  Mr. Lyons then convinced the client to move to her bedroom, undressed her and had sexual intercourse with her, despite her objections.  The client was intimidated by Mr. Lyonsâ€™ large size and manipulated by his promise to get her children back.  On December 31, 2000, Mr. Lyons arrived at the clientâ€™s house just before midnight.  Mr. Lyons demanded to have sex with the client, she refused and he left.  Mr. Lyons called the client several times, asking her to say sexual things over the telephone.  On February 5, 2001, the shelter asked Mr. Lyons to cease all contact with its clients.  Mr. Lyons falsely told the shelter director that the client had been the aggressor.  Mr. Lyonsâ€™ conduct caused the client to relapse in her treatment, leading the court to place her children with a relative.  Matter 4: In summer 1999, Mr. Lyons agreed to represent the mother in a child custody matter.  Mr. Lyons suggested that the client provide sexual favors as payment for his legal services.  The client initially said no, but agreed as she became more desperate for legal assistance.  This arrangement continued for months.  When the client refused to provide sexual favors, Mr. Lyons offered to pay her money for sex. In July 2000, Mr. Lyons told the client that he loved her and was going to leave his wife and family.  The client did not want to develop a relationship with Mr. Lyons and was eventually able to terminate the sexual relationship.  In November 2000, while trying to remove a ring from the clientâ€™s finger, Mr. Lyons picked her up and threw her on the ground.  Mr. Lyons was charged with fourth degree assault.  Despite a no contact order, Mr. Lyons entered the clientâ€™s house while she was sleeping.  Mr. Lyons attempted to have anal sex with the client and in the process choked her unconscious and pinned her down.  The client was eventually able to contact the police.  Matter 5: In 1999, a client retained Mr. Lyons to collect a judgment she was awarded in a defamation case and to represent her in a lawsuit filed against her.  Mr. Lyons prepared one form dismissing the lawsuit, when the plaintiff did not show up for trial.  In October 2000, the client paid Mr. Lyons $2,000 to represent her in another lawsuit filed by a lawyer to collect his fees.  Mr. Lyons told the client that the arbitration was continued, so she did not attend.  The arbitration was not continued and the arbitrator entered a $35,000 default judgment against the client. Mr. Lyons told the client he would deposit the clientâ€™s $35,000 in his trust account to prevent the lawyer from collecting, convert it to his own use and the client could recover the money from the Lawyers Fund for Client Protection.   Mr. Lyons also borrowed money from the client and used her credit card for over $3,000 more than their agreement. Matter 6: In early 2000, Mr. Lyons agreed to represent the husband in a marriage dissolution action.  In April 2000 the parties reached an agreement including a $3000 payment from the wife to the husband.  In February 2001, the wifeâ€™s lawyer sent the $3,000 to Mr. Lyons.  Mr. Lyons deposited the check, but did not notify his client.  In April 2001, the client filed his own motion for a contempt judgment against the wife for failure to pay the $3,000.  Prior to the hearing, the client stopped by Mr. Lyons office and learned that Mr. Lyons was no longer there.  The client learned in court, for the first time, that the wife had made the payment.  The back of the check contains two signatures, but neither is the clientâ€™s.  The client never received his funds.  Mr. Lyonsâ€™ conduct violated RPCs 8.4(a), prohibiting attempting to violate the RPCs through the acts of another; 8.4(b), prohibiting committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; 1.7(b), prohibiting representation of a client if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests; 1.8(k), prohibiting sexual relations with a current client, unless a consensual relationship existed at the time the representation began; 1.14,  requiring lawyers to promptly notify a client of the receipt of funds and pay the funds to the client when requested; 2.1, requiring lawyers to exercise independent judgment; 1.8, prohibiting lawyers from entering business transactions with clients, unless the terms are fair and reasonable, the client consents and has a reasonable opportunity to seek independent legal advice; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed of the status of their matters; and 1.3, requiring lawyers to act with reasonable diligence and promptness.James Trujillo represented the Bar Association in the first hearing and Sachia Stonefeld Powell in the second.

Robinson (WSBA No. 11269, admitted 1980), of Spokane, received a reprimand on May 4, 2001, based on a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board.  This discipline is based on his failure to avoid a conflict of interest in 1995.In 1995, Mr. Robinson represented Ms. S in a guardianship petition for her fatherâ€™s estate.  Ms. S was appointed guardian and then, in October 1995, the father died.  Ms. S was appointed personal representative of the fatherâ€™s estate and retained Mr. Robinson to represent the estate and complete the probate.  The estateâ€™s main asset was a bank account with a $194,000 balance.  Ms. S. told Mr. Robinson that she and the father, prior to his death, signed documents converting the bank account to a joint account with right of survivorship. The other heirs believed the bank account to be an estate asset.  Mr. Robinson also learned that the bank refused to recognize the signature card purporting to create the joint account.  Mr. Robinson agreed to advocate Ms. Sâ€™s position without advise Ms. S or the other heirs about the conflict or obtaining their written consent to continue the representations.  Mr. Robinson withdrew from the representation in 1996.  In 1997, the court found that the account was an estate asset.Mr. Robinsonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.7(a), prohibiting representing a client if the representation will be directly adverse to another client, unless the lawyer believes the representation will not adversely affect the relationship with the other client and both clients consent in writing after full disclosure and consultation.Leslie Allen represented the Bar Association.

King (WSBA No. 7370, admitted 1977), of Seattle was suspended for six months, effective April 25, 2002, by order of the Supreme Court, following a hearing. This discipline is based on his lack of diligence in one matter and misrepresentation in another in 1995.Matter 1: Mr. King, or his office, accepted responsibility for filing a clientâ€™s small claims court notice of appeal.  The clientâ€™s notice was not timely filed and he lost the right to appeal.Matter 2: In November 1995, Mr. King contacted the escrow company holding lien funds that had been assigned to his wife, Rita King.  The funds were disputed fees from Mr. G, a prior clientâ€™s dissolution action.  Mr. King asked the escrow agent to release the funds to him even though the escrow instructions indicated the funds had been assigned to Rita King.  When the escrow agent refused, Mr. King filed a motion in Mr. Gâ€™s divorce action, asking the court to disburse the escrow funds to Mr. King to hold â€œin trustâ€ for Rita King.  Mr. King stated in the motion that he continued to represent Mr. G.  Mr. Kingâ€™s representation of Mr. G ended in 1993 and the client disputed Mr. Kingâ€™s right to the lien funds.  Mr. King did not give notice of his motion to the parties involved in the earlier dissolution.  Mr. King also did not disclose to the court that his divorce from Rita King was then pending in Snohomish County Superior Court.  Mr. King presented this motion to conceal the existence of these funds from Rita King and the Court presiding over his dissolution.Mr. Kingâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 3.3, prohibiting lawyers from making false statements of fact to the tribunal; 1.15, requiring lawyers to take steps to protect clientâ€™s interest, upon withdrawal; 3.5(b), prohibiting ex-parte communication with the tribunal, except as permitted by law; and 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.

Thomas (WSBA No. 20076, admitted 1990), of Enumclaw, was suspended for ninety days by order of the Supreme Court following a hearing, effective February 10, 2003.  This discipline is based on his continuing to practice of law during an administrative license suspension during 1999.  In May 1998, the Washington State Bar Association (WSBA) notified Mr. Thomas that it had not received his required mandatory continuing legal education (MCLE) report for 1995 through 1997, which was due December 31, 1997.

Kelly (WSBA No. 14616, admitted 1984), of Spokane, has been suspended for two years effective December 11, 2000, by order of the Supreme Court, approving a stipulation. The discipline is based on his failure to diligently represent several clients.Matter 1: On May 29, 1998, Mr. Kelly met with a client regarding a child support modification. The client paid Mr. Kelly $120 for a filing fee and a $750 advance fee deposit. Although Mr. Kelly indicated that the $750 fee was nonrefundable, there was no written fee agreement, and the client reasonably expected that the unearned fee would be returned. After discussing with the client that the court may not have jurisdiction, Mr. Kelly filed a petition for modification of child support.On September 18, 1998, the client received copies of the filed pleadings and provided names of process servers in Nevada, where the father lived. Mr. Kelly did not arrange for service on the father, and took no further action on the clientâ€™s case. The client asked that Mr. Kelly return her original paperwork and her $750 advance fee deposit. As of the date of the stipulation, Mr. Kelly had not met her request.Matter 2: On April 30, 1996, Mr. Kelly agreed to represent the mother in a parenting-plan modification.

Mr. Kelly did not serve the father with the petition.In August 1997, the client met with Mr. Kelly to discuss the case, and asked for copies of associated documents, filings and correspondence, along with an itemized billing. As of the date of the stipulation, Mr. Kelly had not provided copies of these documents to the client.On April 5, 1998, the client sent Mr. Kelly a certified letter asking him to resolve the case by June 30, 1998, or return her fee. Mr. Kelly signed for the letter, but did not respond to the clientâ€™s request. Mr. Kelly took no further action on the clientâ€™s case.Matter 3: On April 11, 1997, a client retained Mr. Kelly to represent her juvenile son in a criminal matter. The son had been convicted of robbery and sentenced to two years in jail. The client requested that Mr. Kelly file a motion for reconsideration of the sentence, and paid Mr. Kelly a $3,000 advance fee deposit. In June, Mr. Kelly told the client he had filed the paperwork and that the next court date was June 20, 1997 at 3:00 p.m. In fact, Mr. Kelly had not filed any paperwork and there was no court date set.On June 19, 1997, Mr. Kelly told the client that the hearing had been postponed until June 27, 1997.

When the client pointed out that this was a holiday, Mr. Kelly told her he would get back to her. After this, Mr. Kelly did not return the clientsâ€™ calls. Mr. Kelly did not file any pleadings, schedule any court dates, or return any of the clientâ€™s advance fee deposit.Matter 4: On May 29, 1997, the mother and grandparents of a child retained Mr. Kelly to modify residential placement and visitation with the child.

In October 1997, he refunded the clientâ€™s $2,000.Matter 5: In February or March 1996, Mr. Kelly agreed to represent the wife in a marriage dissolution action. The parties reached agreement in May 1997. Mr. Kelly was responsible for drafting the final pleadings, which he did not do. Opposing counsel drafted the pleadings and arranged for all the parties to sign them. Mr. Kelly received the signed pleadings on November 24, 1997, and filed them on January 20, 1998. Mr. Kelly did not notify his client that he filed final pleadings, or provide her copies.Matter 6: Mr. Kelly agreed to represent the wife in a marriage dissolution matter. The client paid a $1,000 advance fee deposit, and Mr. Kelly told her he billed at $75 per hour.

Cody (WSBA No. 6582, admitted 1976), of Lynnwood, was disbarred effective May 29, 2002, following a stipulation to discipline approved by the Supreme Court. Mr. Cody stipulated that these facts would likely be proven at a hearing. This discipline is based on his theft of client funds in 2000 and 2001. Matter 1: In September 2000, Mr. Cody agreed to represent the husband in a marital dissolution action.  During the case, the parties sold their home.  Mr. Cody agreed to hold the sale proceeds in this trust account until the partiesâ€™ settled the property issues.  In February 2001, Mr. Cody received the clientsâ€™ $175,037.  By February 2001, Mr. Cody had spent $40,000 of the partiesâ€™ money for his own purposes.  In March 2001, the court issued an order freezing the funds.  Later, the court ordered Mr. Cody to repay $40,000 and transfer the remaining funds to the clientâ€™s new lawyer.Matter 2: In May 1991, Mr. Cody agreed to represent three clients in a lawsuit.  The clients signed a written contingent fee agreement providing a 25% fee for settlement prior to trial.  The parties settled the suit prior to trial for $25,000.  By 1996, Mr. Cody had used all but $506.54 of the clientsâ€™ money for his own purposes.  Mr. Cody suggested that the clients leave their money with him until the statute of limitations on any attorneyâ€™s fee claim from opposing counsel expired.  In June 2000, Mr. Cody told the clients that their account balance was $26,376.  In August and October 2000, the clients provided Mr. Cody with written disbursement instructions, but Mr. Cody did not disburse their money.  He provided them with false bank statements.  In January 2001, Mr. Cody gave two of the clients a cashierâ€™s check for $23,002.from one trust account.  Later that same day, Mr. Cody gave the clients the $554 remaining in the initial trust account.  Also on this same day, Mr. Cody issued a $4,000 check to the third client from a third trust account.

Russell Van Camp (WSBA No. 5385, admitted 1973), of Spokane, was suspended for six months by order of the Supreme Court following a hearing, effective August 22, 2002.  Mr. Van Camp was reinstated to active practice on February 24, 2003.  This discipline was based on his making a false statement to the bankruptcy tribunal in 1994.In 1994, Mr. Van Camp was involved in litigation with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  In October 1994, the IRS threatened to levy some of Mr. Van Campâ€™s clients. Mr. Van Camp filed a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy petition to avoid the IRS levy.  Although Mr. Van Campâ€™s residence and law practice were in Spokane, he listed his address in the bankruptcy petition as Denver Colorado.  Additionally, Mr. Van Camp did not include all of his assets on the bankruptcy schedules.  In October 1994, the Bankruptcy Trusteeâ€™s attorney filed a motion to dismiss Mr. Van Campâ€™s bankruptcy for improper venue and incomplete or deficient schedules.  In November 1994, Mr. Van Camp filed an objection to the motion and requested a hearing.  During the February 1995 hearing, the testimony established that the Colorado address on the bankruptcy petition was for Mail Boxes, Inc, that Mr. Van Camp was married and that both assets and debts were missing from the schedules.  The Bankruptcy trustee agreed to a change in venue to the District of Eastern Washington.  In June 1995, the Bankruptcy Court granted Mr. Van Campâ€™s motion to dismiss his petition.  The Trustee referred the matter to the United States Attorneyâ€™s Office in Colorado for possible â€œbankruptcy fraud.â€  The U.S. Attorney did not prosecute.  Mr. Van Campâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 3.1, prohibiting lawyers from filing frivolous claims; 3.3 prohibiting lawyers from knowingly making false statements of material fact or law to the tribunal; and 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.Jean McElroy represented the Bar Association.

This discipline is based on revealing his clientâ€™s secrets or confidences and failing to avoid conflicts of interest in 1998.In 1993, Mr. Kovach agreed to represent a client in a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Mr. Kovach negotiated a payment agreement for a portion of the clientâ€™s debt and  advised the client that his remaining debt would be eligible for bankruptcy after August 15, 1997.  Mr. Kovach was concerned about the clientâ€™s sporadic, but substantial, real estate broker commissions, so he advised the client to quit and obtain a more traditional, lower wage position.  On June 25, 1997, the client told Mr. Kovach that the client had already earned $100,000 and expected another $200,000 in the next six months on real estate commissions.  On July 17, 1997, the client paid Mr. Kovach $1,200 in fees for the bankruptcy, but still owed Mr. Kovachâ€™s firm $9,000 that could be discharged in the bankruptcy.  In January 1998, the client retained a second lawyer to assist in the representation.  Mr. Kovach withdrew from the representation, asserted an attorneyâ€™s lien on the clientâ€™s files and drafted a confession of judgment for the clientâ€™s signature.  The confession of judgment included the following paragraph: the firm has extended me credit based on financial statements . .  .that were materially false regarding my ability to pay these fees, but on which the law firm reasonably relied.  I prepared and submitted these statements to them with the intent to deceive them and to cause them to carry my account until such time as I could declare bankruptcy and discharge their debt.â€  Mr. Kovachâ€™s statement was intended to prevent the client from discharging the firmâ€™s debt in the bankruptcy.  The client refused to sign the confession of judgment.  In February 1998, Mr. Kovach filed a civil complaint against the client in the law firmâ€™s name alleging breach of contract and fraud.  The complaint included the income information the client provided to Mr. Kovach during the June 25, 1997 meeting.  By including this information in the complaint, Mr. Kovach revealed the clientâ€™s secrets and confidences.  Mr. Kovach did not file the complaint under seal.  Mr. Kovachâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.6, prohibiting lawyers from revealing client secrets and confidences relating to representation unless the client consents after full disclosure; and 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests.

Lux (WSBA No. 24581, admitted 1995), formerly of Kirkland, was suspended for sixty days, following a stipulation, by order of the Supreme Court, effective December 17, 2002.  This discipline was based on his failure to diligently represent three clients, refund unearned fees and dishonest conduct in 2000 and 2001.Matter 1: In September 2000, Mr. Lux agreed to represent a client in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy matter.  On September 18, 2000, the client paid Mr. Lux a non-refundable flat fee.  After September 28, 2000, Mr. Lux sent the client bankruptcy forms to complete.  The client called for advice on how to fill out the forms, but Mr. Lux did not return his calls. In March 2001, the client retained substitute counsel to complete his bankruptcy.  On March 26, 2001, Mr. Lux sent the client a letter informing him that Mr. Lux had transferred the clientâ€™s case to another lawyer.  The client responded that he had hired a different lawyer and wanted a full refund of his fees.  Mr. Lux did not refund the clientâ€™s fees. Mr. Luxâ€™s paralegal stated that Mr. Lux told her to make untrue statements to disciplinary counsel during the investigation of this matter.Matter 2: In October 2000, Mr. Lux agreed to handle a Chapter 7 bankruptcy for a client.  The client paid a non-refundable flat fee.  Mr. Lux told the client he would contact her creditors and ask them to wait for the bankruptcy.  Mr. Lux did not contact the clientâ€™s creditors.  From October through December 2000, Mr. Lux took no action on the clientâ€™s case and failed to answer her phone calls.  In January 2001, the client was incarcerated and provided Mr. Lux with a power of attorney, authorizing her mother to work on the bankruptcy matter.  Mr. Lux did not file the clientâ€™s bankruptcy.  On April 25, 2001, the client fired Mr. Lux and demanded a refund.  Mr. Lux did not refund the clientâ€™s fees.  Matter 3: In January 2001, Mr. Lux agreed to represent the mother in a child residential placement matter.  On January 18, 2001, the parties met for a settlement conference.  The next day, the client fired Mr. Lux.  Mr. Lux did not tell opposing counsel that he no longer represented the father, and she sent him draft final documents.  In January 2001, Mr. Lux told opposing counsel that the mother was having second thoughts about the settlement.  Opposing counsel set a deposition date for the mother and suggested that the case be set for trial.  Mr. Lux took no further action.  On September 10, 2001, the court authorized opposing counsel to contact Mr. Luxâ€™s client.

McAllister (WSBA No. 22279, admitted 1992), of Spanaway, was disbarred August 22, 2002, by order of the Supreme Court, following a hearing. This discipline was based on his failure to comply with stipulated probation conditions imposed following a disciplinary matter in 1998.	On March 11, 1998, the Supreme Court approved Mr. McAllisterâ€™s stipulation to an 18-month suspension followed by two years probation.  The probation conditions included requiring Mr. McAllister to obey all laws; abstain from possession, use or consumption of alcohol and/or controlled substances; and continue substance abuse treatment.  On February 23, 1999, Mr. McAllister entered a deferred prosecution on charges of driving under the influence of intoxicants, reckless driving and hit and run.  Mr. McAllister was reinstated to active practice on September 22, 1999.   From November 1999 through the end of the probationary period, Mr. McAllister failed to attend his treatment appointments.

McLendon (WSBA No. 1187, admitted 1969), of Spokane, was suspended for sixty days, following a stipulation to discipline, by order of the Supreme Court, effective September 9, 2002.  Mr. McLendon was disbarred prior to the effective date of this suspension.  This discipline is based on his failure to comply with a prior disciplinary order between 1993 and 2000.In 1993, the Supreme Court imposed restitution as part of a disciplinary sanction.  The Court required Mr. McLendon to enter into a payment plan as part of his reinstatement to active status.  Mr. McLendon was reinstated to active status in April 1993.  Between March and early December 1993, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) sent Mr. McLendon several letters proposing payment plans and asking for more information.  Mr. McLendon failed to respond, so ODC opened a new disciplinary proceeding based on failure to comply with the court order requiring agreement to a payment plan.  After the new disciplinary proceeding was initiated, Mr. McLendon agreed to a payment plan requiring $500 minimum monthly payments to the victims listed in the restitution agreement.  The agreement did not indicate how the payments should be allocated among the victims.  The separate criminal proceeding in Spokane Superior Court obliged Mr. McLendon to make restitution of $101,984.27 to five victims.  Additionally, some of the victims also obtained separate civil judgments against Mr. McLendon.  The victims in the disciplinary proceeding, criminal proceeding and civil proceedings were not identical. As of February 18, 1993, Mr. McLendon owed $152,395 to the victims listed in the disciplinary proceeding.  Between January 1994 and March 2000, Mr. McLendon did not pay a minimum of $500 each month, but the average of all payments over that time was slightly over $500 per month.  The hearing officer found that Mr. McLendon willfully failed to make the required minimum payments and provide the required periodic income reporting to ODC.  Mr. McLendon intentionally handled a significant portion of his business on a cash basis and failed to keep records of this business to avoid the reporting requirements.  Mr. McLendon did not distribute the restitution payments to the victims pro rata.  He paid the victims with criminal or civil orders, or other who threatened litigation.  Some victims received no payments.  Mr. McLendonâ€™s conduct violated RLD 5.3(c), stating that failure to make restitution payments when ordered may constitute grounds for discipline.Christine Gray represented the Bar Association.

This discipline is based on his filing and failing to release an inappropriate lien from 2000 through 2001.In July 1999, a client retained the DeDamm law firm to represent him in a rape investigation.  The client was engaged to the victimâ€™s mother and was purchasing a home with her.  On July 27, 1999, the home purchase closed and on August 12, 1999, the client quit claimed all interest in the property to the victimâ€™s mother.  Later, the engagement was called off.  On March 22, 2000, Mr. DeDammâ€™s firm filed a Notice of Attorney Lien against the home for the clientâ€™s $58.675.64 unpaid attorneyâ€™s fees.  Mr. DeDamm believed that the client had an interest in the property, but did not confirm this prior to signing the lien.  The client was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.  Mr. DeDamm learned of the quit claim deed shortly after the July 2000 sentencing hearing.  In March 2001, another lawyer wrote to Mr. DeDamm requesting that the lien be released.  In April 2001, the mother filed a grievance against Mr. DeDamm.  Mr. DeDamm took no actions to release the lien until after the civil suit settled and the mother agreed to drop the grievance.  Mr. DeDamm was not aware that the attorney lien statute does not allow liens on real property.

This discipline is based on her conduct during 1998 through 2000, involving lack of diligence, advancing financial assistance to a client, negligent misrepresentation and failure to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation.Matter 1: In 1998, Ms. Irons filed a complaint against her clientsâ€™ former employer, asking for past due sales commissions.   Ms. Irons did not timely answer the defendantâ€™s discovery requests and failed to appear at the defendantâ€™s motion to compel answers to discovery.  The court ordered that Ms. Ironsâ€™ client provide discovery within 10 days and imposed $750.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees. When Ms. Irons failed to comply with the court order to provide discovery, the court granted the defendantâ€™s motion to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice.

McKean (WSBA No.16537, admitted 1983), of Moses Lake, was suspended for six months by order of the Supreme Court following a hearing, effective March 26, 2003.  For additional information, please see In re McKean, 148 Wn.2d 849, 64 P.3d 1226 (2003). This discipline is based on his business transaction with his clients and failure to properly administer his trust account in 1997. In 1997, Mr. McKean agreed to represent Mr. and Mrs. M. in a Chapter 12 bankruptcy.  In July 1997, Mr. McKean learned that his clients have not been filing required reports.  He believed that the court would involuntarily dismiss the clientâ€™s bankruptcy. Mr. McKean advised the clients to dismiss the bankruptcy and form a corporation to protect them from creditors.  The clients asked Mr. McKean for help managing their farm and for financial assistance.  In July, 1997, Mr. McKean agreed to take an ownership interest in the clientâ€™s business.  Mr. McKean took a 51% interest in the business and the clients retained 49%.  In June and July 1997, Mr. McKean wrote four checks totaling $11,128.25 from his trust account for the clientâ€™s benefit.  The amount was charged to an estate for which Mr. McKean was the personal representative with non-intervention powers.  Mr. McKean did not notify the estate of this loan or prepare any documentation of the terms.  After receiving financial help, the clients refused to dismiss the bankruptcy, so Mr. McKean did not perfect the corporation, but continued to treat it as a separate entity.  In November 1997, realizing that he would be unable to recoup the â€œloanâ€ of estate funds, Mr. McKean borrowed $23,000 and reimbursed the estate account.  The clients retained new counsel who contacted the Bar Association.  The Bar Association auditor found that Mr. McKeanâ€™s trust account had errors, missing records and a negative balance at times. Mr. McKean also used his trust account as his general business account for approximately two weeks.  Mr. McKeanâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.14, requiring lawyers to preserve client funds deposited into the lawyerâ€™s trust account, keep the lawyerâ€™s funds separate from the client funds and maintain complete records of funds in the lawyerâ€™s possession; 1.7(b), prohibiting lawyers from representing clients if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibility to another client, a third party or by the lawyerâ€™s own interests; and 1.8(a) prohibiting a lawyer from entering a business transaction with a client, unless the transaction is fair and reasonable, the client consents and the client is given a reasonable opportunity to seek independent advice.Philip E.

46.html,15065,Nathan Dysart,,Suspension,11/20/1996,,"Olympia lawyer Nathan Dysart (WSBA No. 15065, admitted 1985) has been ordered suspended from the practice of law for six months, pursuant to a stipulation for discipline, approved November 20, 1996. The discipline is based upon his neglect of three client matters, in violation of RPCs 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 3.2.Holmes MatterIn 1990, lawyer Dysart agreed to represent client Holmes in a contract dispute. Holmes sold his vending machine business to Bert Gower, who then failed to pay on the promissory note. Dysart filed Holmes's lawsuit in King County Superior Court on or about December 6, 1990, but he did not send the Summons and Complaint to the Sheriff for service until April 4, 1991. This delay between filing and service violated RCW4. 16.170 (commencement of action) and the King County Superior Court Case Scheduling Order. Based on violation of the Scheduling Order, the Court set a non-compliance hearing. Based on the improper commencement of the lawsuit, the defendant demanded that the lawsuit be dismissed and threatened a counter-claim for rescission. Dysart, apparently, determined that the counter-claim was serious and that Holmes should dismiss his lawsuit. Dysart states that he sent Holmes a letter indicating that Dysart would allow the lawsuit to be dismissed if he had not heard from Holmes by the end of the month. This letter was addressed to Bart Gower, the opposing party, and contained Holmes's prior address. Holmes states that he never received this letter. Dysart did not attend the required noncompliance hearing and Holmes's lawsuit was dismissed. Dysart never told Holmes that his lawsuit had been dismissed.Malit MatterClient Malit retained lawyer Dysart in January 1991 to represent him on felony charges. The first trial ended in a mistrial, however, the second trial ended in a conviction. On June 19, 1992, Malit was sentenced, told Dysart that he wanted to appeal, and Dysart agreed to prosecute this appeal. Dysart filed Malit's Notice of Appeal on July 13, 1992, but did not pay the filing fee. On July 24, 1992, Dysart received a notice from the Court of Appeals Clerk stating that if he did not pay the filing fee or file an Order of Indigency by August 28, 1992, Malit's appeal would be dismissed. Dysart filed a Motion for Partial Indigency, but did not obtain an order until December 16, 1992â€”14 days after the Court of Appeals dismissed Malit's case for want of prosecution. Dysart wrote to Malit indicating that his appeal had been dismissed because the superior court failed to timely authorize payment for the transcripts. Two superior court judges and the Office of Assigned Counsel wrote to Malit explaining that it was Dysart's responsibility to perfect Malit's appeal.Parsons MatterLawyer Dysart represented client Parsons in a dissolution and the subsequent bankruptcy. Dysart filed Parsons' Answer to Petition for Dissolution on the same day the court entered an Order of Default against Parsons. Dysart filed a Motion to Set Aside Default, which the court granted. Dysart did not inform his client of the Default Order or the Motion to Set Aside Default. In April 1991, Parsons signed what he believed to be the final pleadings in his dissolution and then left town for two months. During these two months, the opposing counsel scheduled Parsons' deposition. Dysart obtained a continuance of the deposition, but did not notify Parsons of the new date. At the conclusion of the dissolution, the court awarded a $500 judgment against Parsons for failure to attend two depositions. The court also awarded six additional judgments against Parsons. Dysart told Parsons not to pay the judgments because they would appeal. Dysart did file an appeal, but did not file a supersedeas bond to stay enforcement of the judgments during appeal.In September 1992, Dysart filed Parsonsâ€™s bankruptcy petition. After the Court granted Dysart's motion to extend the time to file particular schedules, Dysart failed to file the schedules and the Court dismissed the case. Dysart did not notify Parsons that his bankruptcy had been dismissed.For approximately one year after filing the civil appeal; Dysart continued to tell Parsons that he was receiving extensions from the Court of Appeals. After many motions to dismiss for failure to meet deadlines and several sanctions against Parsons for late filings, the court ordered that the case be automatically dismissed unless Dysart filed the Verbatim Report of Proceedings or confirmation that the automatic stay from the Bankruptcy Court was in effect. On March 28,1993, Dysart told Parsons that lawyer Dysart had forgotten to order the transcripts. The court reporter told him it would take three weeks, and that March 28. 1993, was the last day to perfect the appeal. On April 7, 1993, the Court of Appeals dismissed Parsons' case. The court reinstated Parsonâ€™s appeal, pursuant to a motion from Parsonâ€™s new counsel and payment of an additional $500 in attorneys fees.The hearing officer was Judith Mandel of Port Orchard. Respondent was represented by Thomas Meyer.

This discipline is based on her failing to disclose material facts to the tribunal.In 1990, a firm assisting indigent inmates with post-conviction matters employed Ms. Schattauer.  The firm assigned Ms. Schattauer to represent Mr. A. in personal restraint petition.  In 1993, Ms. Schattauer opened her own law practice and continued to represent Mr. A.   In May 1993, Ms. Schattauer filed a motion to renew the clientâ€™s appeal and to renew the order establishing indigency.  The motion was supported by the clientâ€™s certified statement advising the court that his marital status had changed. The client and Ms. Schattauer were married in April 1993.  The motion did not disclose community assets, including Ms. Schattaurâ€™s home and a mutual fund.  In 1996, Ms. Schattauer filed a personal restraint petition for the client.  This petition requested waiver of the appellate filing fee and contained a statement of finances.  Neither the petition nor the clientâ€™s affidavit disclosed the clientâ€™s marital status.  The court waived the filing fee.  At this same time, the undisclosed community mutual fund contained sufficient funds to pay the filing fee. Ms. Schattaurâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting making a false statement of material fact to the tribunal; and 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.Leslie Allen represented the Bar Association.

The Court issued the certificate of finality in the case on July 7, 2000. For additional information, please see the published Supreme Court opinion. The suspension began on May 22, 2000 pursuant to an order allowing the suspension to begin while the case was pending. The discipline is based on Mr. Halversonâ€™s consensual sexual relationship with his client during her dissolution case and his failure to explain the potential conflicts to the client.Mr. Halverson had consensual sexual relationships with six female clients over a period of more than 10 years. During this time, Mr. Halverson was married. The most recent relationship began in 1991. The client worked in Mr. Halversonâ€™s office in 1990, and retained him to represent her in a marriage dissolution action in May 1991. Mr. Halverson filed the dissolution petition in June 1991, and the client moved out of her husbandâ€™s house in July.The same month, the client confided to Mr. Halverson that she was attracted to him. Shortly after that, following a successful court hearing, Mr. Halverson took the client to an art exhibit and then to a restaurant, where they discussed the ground rules for a potential relationship. Mr. Halverson stated that his wife could not find out and that he could not have a relationship with the clientâ€™s children. Mr. Halverson told the client that if these rules were followed, their relationship would not affect her pending divorce. He did not explain to the client the possible effects on her pending divorce if their relationship was discovered. Mr. Halverson had a sexual relationship with his client for the next six months.On January 1, 1992, Mr. Halversonâ€™s wife, who was also his office manager, discovered the affair. Within a few days, Mr. Halverson withdrew from the clientâ€™s case. He temporarily moved out of his home and continued his relationship with the client, but in mid-February, told the client that he was returning to his wife, and the client retained new counsel to complete her divorce. In October 1994, the client filed a civil suit against Mr. Halverson. The civil suit settled in 1995 for a substantial sum and was sealed by agreement. The clientâ€™s husband sued and received half of the settlement.Mr. Halversonâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.4(b), requiring lawyers to explain matters to the extent reasonably necessary to permit their clients to make informed decisions regarding representation; 1.7(b), prohibiting lawyers from representing a client if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to another client, a third person or the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after consultation and a full disclosure of the material facts; and 2.1, requiring lawyers to exercise independent professional judgment in representing clients.Andrea Darvas represented the Bar Association.

Kelly (WSBA No. 14616, admitted 1984), of Spokane was suspended for two years effective May 14 2003, by order of the Supreme Court following a hearing.  This discipline is based on his practicing law while his license was suspended, failing to refund an unearned fee deposit and failing to properly document and account for client funds in 2000.In October 1999, Mr. Kelly agreed to represent the daughter and step-daughter of an Alzheimerâ€™s dementia patient.  The clients wanted advice about financial and care decisions and in particular how to qualify the patient for Medicaid long term care.  In December 1999, Mr. Kelly drafted two Medicaid gift distribution documents and disbursement checks for the daughterâ€™s signature.  Mr. Kelly deposited one of these checks into his trust account as an advance fee deposit.  By May 2000, Mr. Kelly had paid himself $6,000 in fees.  Mr. Kellyâ€™s license to practice law was suspended in May, but he continued to practice. In June, Mr. Kelly told the clients he could no longer represent them, but did not disclose his interim suspension.   In July 2000, Mr. Kelly submitted an outdated Medicaid form.  The clients completed the corrected form and obtained Medicaid coverage for the patient without Mr. Kellyâ€™s assistance.  The clients asked Mr. Kelly for an accounting of the $5,000.  He did not provide an accounting or any billing statements to the clients. Mr. Kelly failed to respond to the Bar Association during the investigation of this matter.

Matter 1: In July 1999, Mr. Patlan agreed to represent a client in an employment discrimination case.  Mr. Patlan filed a complaint against five corporations and two individuals.

Benjamin (WSBA No. 15223, admitted 1985), of Seattle, received a censure on June 20, 2002, following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board on May 8, 2002. This discipline is based upon his failure to timely file a lawsuit, to communicate with his client regarding the statute of limitations, and to advise his client to seek independent counsel regarding a revised fee agreement between 1995 and 1998.On March 10, 1995, Ms. M was rear-ended, causing minor damage to the car and personal injury to Ms. M. On April 30, Ms. M went to Mr. Benjamin for legal advice about her case, and he advised her that the case was probably worth $2,000 to $3,000. Ms. M decided to reject a prior settlement offer from the insurance company. Throughout 1996, Ms. M received physical-therapy treatments for injuries related to the accident. Ms. M mailed letters to Mr. Benjamin on December 14, 1996 and May 23, 1997, asking when her medical bills would be paid. Mr. Benjamin did not respond to the letters.On January 20, 1997, Ms. M called Mr. Benjaminâ€™s office and he did not contact her in response. On March 3, Mr. Benjamin wrote to one health-care provider regarding payment of Ms. Mâ€™s bills from any settlement. In April 1997, the insurance company wrote to say that the $500 settlement offer was still open. On May 19, Mr. Benjamin responded that after his client completed treatment they would present a settlement demand. After learning that the insurance company would not negotiate the $500 offer, Mr. Benjamin stated that he notified Ms. M that he would not be pursuing her claim; however, Ms. M disputes this assertion.On June 29, 1998, Mr. Benjamin informed Ms. M that the statute of limitations had expired in March 1998. Mr. Benjamin set up an appointment for July 1, 1998 to discuss the clientâ€™s unpaid medical bills and the expired statute of limitations. During this appointment, Mr. Benjamin asked Ms. M and her husband to sign a revised fee agreement and release. The agreement purported to obligate Mr. Benjamin to pursue payment of Ms. Mâ€™s medical bills under her insurance policies, and to release Mr. Benjamin from liability for having missed the statute of limitations. Ms. M and her husband signed the revised agreement during the meeting. They did not have independent representation either before or when they signed the agreement prospectively limiting Mr. Benjaminâ€™s liability for malpractice. Mr. Benjamin asserts he orally advised them at the meeting that they were entitled to such representation.

The client disputed some of the billed amounts.  Ms. Guthrie and the client disagreed about the amount of the check Ms. Guthrie should receive. In May 2001, Ms. Guthrie deposited the check into her trust account without the clientâ€™s endorsement. Later that month, without the clientâ€™s authorization, Ms. Guthrie disbursed $2,418 to herself and the remaining $82 to the client.

On this same day, Mr. F. quit claimed the home to his brother.  Mr. F. and his wife continued to live in the house and made rental payments to the brother.  In January 2000, Mr. Carter agreed to represent Mr. and Mrs. F. in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition.  The Petition required the clients to list all property they transferred in the last year and all property owned by another, but controlled by them.  Mr. Carter marked â€œnoneâ€ in response to these questions, believing that the transfer did not have to be disclosed.  When Mr. Carter learned that the clients should have disclosed the transfer, he planned to convert the Chapter 7 filing to a Chapter 13 filing, so that the clients could voluntarily dismiss the petition, and re-file a new petition including the transfer.  Mr. Carter did not tell the clients about the conversion to a Chapter 13 filing.  Even though the clients did not meet the Chapter 13 eligibility requirements, the court allowed the conversion. Mr. Carter filed a motion to dismiss the Chapter 13 filing, without the required notice to the trustee.  The court dismissed the filing.

This discipline is based on his conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in 2001.In January 2001, Mr. Lundahl represented a criminal defendant.  During the trial, the prosecutor interviewed a defense witness in the hallway.  After the interview, the prosecutor told the judge that he noticed an odor of intoxicants around the witness. The court then ordered a short recess so that the prosecutor could arrange for a deputy sheriff to interview the witness and provide an independent opinion about the odor of intoxicants.  While the judge was off the bench, the court reporter offered breath mints.  Mr. Lundahl took two breath mints and joked that his witness could probably use them.  Mr. Lundahl gave the breath mints to the witness prior to the sheriff interview. The sheriff deputies were unable to determine whether the odor was from alcohol or a mouthwash.  The court reporter advised the judge about Mr. Lundahlâ€™s comment regarding the breath mints.  After the recess, the judge asked if either lawyer had provided breath mints to the witness.  Mr. Lundahl admitted that he had provided the mints and apologized to the court.  The judge found Mr. Lundahl to be in contempt of court and fined him $300.

This discipline is based on Ms. Georgeâ€™s failure to diligently represent and communicate with a client from 1995 through 1997.In January 1995, Ms. George agreed to represent the mother in a parenting plan and child-support modification. The client had primary residential placement of her two daughters. In December 1994, the 16-year-old daughter had temporarily gone to live with the father. The father filed a petition to modify the parenting plan to award him primary residential placement of the daughter and to terminate his child-support obligation. Ms. George appeared in the case in February 1995, met with her client in March, and accepted one telephone call in June. In September 1995, the client wrote Ms. George asking about the status of her case, and indicating she was in financial distress because she had not received child support. Ms. George did not respond to this letter.In October 1995, Ms. George filed a note for the motion docket, scheduling a hearing on support arrearages for November 1, 1995. She did not file a motion with the notice, so there was no hearing. On January 5, 1996, Ms. George did file a motion to determine support arrearages and the court set a fact-finding hearing. On January 16, the client spoke to another lawyer in Ms. Georgeâ€™s office, Mr. R. Mr. Râ€™s notes of the conversation indicate that the client said she did not want primary residential placement of the child, but needed the child support.On March 5, 1996, the court entered an order signed by Mr. R indicating that the parties agreed to change the childâ€™s residential placement to the father, and to reserve the child-support arrearage issue for a later date. The client did not receive a copy of this order. On April 1, the client wrote another letter to Ms. George indicating she would not agree to give up primary residential placement for the child and needed the back-due child support. Ms. George did not respond to this letter or take any action to resolve the child-support issue. On April 15, 1996, the child turned 18. The client wrote another letter on March 13, 1997. On June 14, 1997, after receiving no response to her letter, the client filed a grievance.Ms. Georgeâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.4(a), requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed of the status of their cases; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; and 1.2(a), requiring lawyers to abide by their clientsâ€™ decisions concerning the objectives of the representation.C.

Butler (WSBA No. 15529, admitted 1985), of Spokane, has been ordered censured pursuant to a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board on September 29, 2000. This discipline is based on Mr. Butlerâ€™s failure to diligently represent and communicate with a client.In August 1994, Mr. Butler agreed to represent a client in an intentional tort claim against the clientâ€™s employer. The client was employed as a horticulturist at a cemetery and was asked to assist in a childâ€™s burial. This experience was devastating to the client, who resigned his position. Although Mr. Butler did not prepare the required written fee agreement, he agreed to represent the client on a contingent-fee basis.The client asked Mr. Butler if he should file a claim against the employer with the Department of Labor and Industries (L&I). The parties dispute whether Mr. Butler advised the client to seek advice from a lawyer familiar with these claims, or whether he advised the client that the claim would not be worth pursuing. Neither Mr. Butler nor the client pursued the claim, and the statute of limitations expired.In September 1995, after receiving no written communication or billing statements from Mr. Butler, the client requested his file. The client discovered that Mr. Butler had taken no action, and that his file contained only the intake notes and correspondence from a psychologist that the client had seen.On June 3, 1997, the clientâ€™s subsequent counsel filed a complaint for damages against the former employer. The case was dismissed on summary judgment as being barred because the client had not filed a claim with L&I.Mr. Butlerâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to act diligently; 1.4, requiring lawyers to explain matters to the extent necessary for clients to make reasonable decisions about their matters; and 1.5(c)(1), requiring contingent-fee agreements to be in writing.C.

For more information, please see In re Cohen, 149 Wn.2d 323, 67 P.3d 1086 (2003).  This discipline was based on his conduct in an employment law matter during 1994.In 1993, Mr. Cohen agreed to represent clients in an employment matter.  In February 1994, the defendant filed a summary judgment motion.  Mr. Cohen did not make any effort to respond to the motion until at or near the time the response was due.  Mr. Cohen asked for additional time to respond and/or a continuance of the trial date.  The court ordered Mr. Cohen to either take a voluntary nonsuit or request a continuance with $1,000 in costs.  The court order stated that the suit would be dismissed on March 7 if Mr. Cohen had not taken one of the options by that date.  Mr. Cohen mailed a letter to the court on March 2 stating he was tendering the costs, but did not pay them until March 10.  The court dismissed the lawsuit.

This discipline was based on his conduct while representing clients in personal injury, child support, bankruptcy and civil litigation matters between 1996 and 2002.  Mr. Kyaw did not admit this conduct, but stipulated that the Association would be able to prove these facts.  Matter 1: In 1996, Mr. Kyaw agreed to represent a minor in a personal injury matter.  Mr. Kyaw agreed to accept a contingent fee, but did not reduce the agreement to writing.  Mr. Kyaw did not obtain the treating doctorâ€™s records or the police report of the accident.  In 1997, Mr. Kyaw told the clientâ€™s father that he was negotiating with the insurance company, but he did not contact the insurance company until November 1998. In December 1998, the insurance company told Mr. Kyaw that it determined in 1996 that it had no liability, and denied the clientâ€™s claim.  Mr. Kyaw did not tell the client or his father that the claim had been denied in 1998 or 1999. Mr. Kyaw told the client not to contact the doctor directly, that Mr. Kyaw would handle the bills.  The insurance company asked Mr. Kyaw to send all of the clientâ€™s medical bills, but he did not respond to this letter. Mr. Kyaw then falsely told the doctorâ€™s office manager that the doctor had agreed to write off the clientâ€™s bill.  During the investigation of this matter, Mr. Kyaw intentionally fabricated letters with the intent to deceive the Association.Matter 2: In January 2002 Mr. Kyaw agreed to represent a client in a child support modification matter.  In March 2002, Mr. Kyaw discussed draft pleading with his client and the client asked for changes.  The client was not able to contact Mr. Kyaw after this time.  Matter 3: In March 2002, Mr. Kyaw agreed to represent a client in a bankruptcy matter.  The bankruptcy plan was confirmed, but Mr. Kyaw failed to file the final decree with the bankruptcy court.  He also failed to challenge a $550 per month late fee assessed by the clientâ€™s mortgage company.  Mr. Kyaw did not respond to the clientâ€™s phone calls or letters.  Matter 4: In May 2000, Mr. Kyaw agreed to represent clients in a dispute with their neighbors.  Mr. Kyaw agreed to file a complaint and to seek a temporary restraining order.  Mr. Kyaw sent the clients an order of default that appeared to have been entered in their case in July 2000.  In late 2001 or early 2002, the clients retained substitute counsel because they were unable to contact Mr. Kyaw.

509.html,9756,Grosvenor Anschell,,Disbarment,5/29/2003,,"Grosvenor Anschell (WSBA No. 9756, admitted 1954), of Bellevue, was disbarred effective May 29, 2003, by order of the Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 1993 through 1997 involving immigration and escrow matters. For additional information, please see In re Anschell, 149 Wn.2d 484, 69 P.3d 844 (2003).Matter 1: In 1993, Mr. Anschell agreed to represent Mr. D in his request for a grant of immunity from the I.N.S. Mr. D had married and then divorced, but continued to live with Ms. B, a citizen of the Philippines. Mr. D then obtained an alien fiancÃ©e visa for Ms. B's niece, and they were subsequently married. Mr. D then divorced the niece and wanted a grant of immunity to report the niece to the I.N.S. Mr. Anschell wrote a letter to the I.N.S. requesting the grant of immunity. In 1995, the I.N.S. issued notice of intent to rescind the niece's permanent-residence status based on a fraudulent marriage. The niece then retained Mr. Anschell to represent her in the rescission case. Mr. Anschell did not discuss this conflict of interest with either of his clients. Mr. Anschell did not respond to the I.N.S. rescission notice, and the I.N.S. rescinded the niece's status and terminated her right to be employed in the U.S. A year after the decision, Mr. Anschell prepared documents to adjust the niece's status. In these documents, Mr. Anschell answered no to questions asking whether the niece had ever procured a visa by fraud or had ever been the subject of immigration proceedings. When Mr. D learned that Mr. Anschell represented the niece, he filed a grievance with the WSBA. Mr. Anschell told the WSBA he would withdraw, but did not do so. Mr. Anschell requested, and the court ordered, that the niece be voluntarily deported. He then waived the niece's right to appeal.Matter 2: In 1996, Mr. Anschell agreed to act as the closing escrow agent for two residential property transactions. The first sale closed in February 1996, but the second was delayed when the seller died. In June 1996, the parties signed the documents for the second sale and Mr. Anschell completed the HUD-1 Settlement Statement (statement). The statement did not include a $20 disbursement Mr. Anschell had made the day prior to sending the statement to the lender. On June 20, 1996, Mr. Anschell received the loan proceeds and a check from the purchasers. Mr. Anschell did not deposit the purchasers' check into his trust account until July 3, 1996. Although Mr. Anschell was aware of the disbursement amounts by June 20, he made the payments between June 20 and August 19. He paid off the first mortgage on July 29, increasing the pay-off amount. Mr. Anschell prepared the final HUD-1 form more than a year after the sale closed, and the form was not accurate. As of August 1996, Mr. Anschell had not paid the title and mortgage-insurance premiums. In December 1997, Mr. Anschell deposited $300 of his own funds into the trust account to make the premium payments. Matter 3: On March 24, 1997, while in court for another matter, Mr. B asked Mr. Anschell to represent him. Mr. Anschell agreed, filed a notice of appearance, and obtained an order allowing a brief to be filed on April 28. The forms Mr. Anschell filed contained the client's address. Mr. Anschell did not contact his client or file the brief. In June 1997, the court ordered the client deported. Mr. Anschell received a copy of this decision, but did not send it to his client. The I.N.S. went to the address on the forms and took the client into custody. The client retained new counsel and unsuccessfully attempted to re-open the deportation proceedings. Mr. Anschell did not promptly or fully cooperate with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel's investigation. Mr. Anschell's conduct violated RPCs 1.9, prohibiting lawyers from representing a person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person's interests are materially adverse to the interests of the lawyer's former client; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent clients; 4.1(a), prohibiting lawyers from making false statements of fact or law to third parties; 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep their clients reasonably informed of the status of their matters; and 1.14, requiring lawyers to protect client funds; and RLD 2.8(a), requiring lawyers to cooperate with disciplinary investigations.Fred Tausend, Jason Holtman, and Jean McElroy represented the Bar Association.

Haskell (WSBA No. 15779, admitted 1986), of Seattle, received a censure pursuant to a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board on May 18, 2001. This discipline is based on her failure to comply with lawyer trust account requirements between 1996 and 2000.In May 2000, when disciplinary counsel discovered that Ms. Haskell had withdrawn more funds from her trust account than she had deposited on behalf of her clients, the WSBA conducted an audit of Ms. Haskellâ€™s trust account. The audit found that Ms. Haskell did not keep client ledgers or track individual client balances. She did maintain settlement sheets for each client, but they did not always accurately reflect the transactions. This lack of recordkeeping prevented Ms. Haskell from performing meaningful reconciliation of her trust account.The audit manager discovered that Ms. Haskell had distributed more to one client than the client had deposited, creating a shortage in the trust account. Ms. Haskell used other client funds when she made this mistakenly large distribution, creating several negative client balances in her trust account. Ms. Haskell commingled her own funds in the trust account and failed to properly pay her clients; several had a positive balance that should have been returned to them. Ms. Haskell also failed to withdraw her fees from the trust account.In December 2000, the audit manager returned to Ms. Haskellâ€™s office. Although not all suggestions had been implemented, Ms. Haskell had deposited funds to cover the shortage, and was waiting for advice of counsel to fully comply with other recommendations.Ms. Haskellâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.14, requiring lawyers to maintain adequate records of receipt, deposit and disbursement of client funds; promptly pay client funds that are owed; and promptly remove the lawyerâ€™s funds from the trust account.Becky Neal represented the Bar Association.

511.html,18595,Michael Scaringi,,Suspension,6/13/2003,,"Michael J. Scaringi (WSBA No. 18595, admitted 1989), of Mercer Island, was suspended for two years, effective June 13, 2003, by order of the Washington Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2000 and 2002 involving assisting in the unauthorized practice of law, failure to supervise nonlawyer assistants, and conflicts of interest in connection with his affiliation with a number of corporations selling estate planning, insurance, and pre-paid legal services.In early 2000, Mr. Scaringi began working with a California corporation (Corporation A) that advertised itself as a â€œnational estate planning corporationâ€ and stated that it would provide â€œclients, systems and procedures, plus technical supportâ€ to a solo practitioner interested in expanding his or her practice. Mr. Scaringi signed an â€œOffice Services Agreementâ€ with Corporation A, which stated, inter alia, that Corporation A would provide him with personnel, office space, equipment and marketing services, while he would pay the corporation a flat fee for providing certain services relating to the preparation of living trusts and wills. Mr. Scaringi also signed a â€œDelivery Services Agreementâ€ with a Washington corporation (Corporation B) affiliated with Corporation A, whose representatives would deliver completed documents to his clients. At the time of delivery, the representative would also be provided with the opportunity to sell insurance products to the clients. While affiliated with these two corporations, Mr. Scaringi engaged in the following conduct that established grounds for discipline:â€¢  Failing to properly supervise paralegals and other non-legal personnel affiliated with his office;â€¢  Assisting in the unauthorized practice of law by affiliating himself with non-lawyers who marketed living trusts to the public and were delegated legal functions;â€¢  Providing legal services to clients who purchased living trusts procured with the assistance of Corporation A without fully disclosing his own interest in maintaining a continuing business relationship with Corporation A and without obtaining informed consent from his clients;â€¢  Failing to review necessary documents and consult with clients regarding their estate planning options;â€¢  Failing to communicate with clients regarding their estate planning needs, and failing to determine whether a living trust was best suited to each clientâ€™s needs.In April 2001, Corporation A filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in California. At that time, Mr. Scaringiâ€™s association with Corporation A terminated.Between 2000 and 2002, Mr. Scaringi affiliated himself with another California corporation (Corporation C) that provided â€œpre-paid legal servicesâ€ to individuals with â€œmembershipsâ€ in the corporation. Mr. Scaringi agreed to provide Washington members of Corporation C with estate planning services. Corporation C also contracted with two other California entities, jointly referred to as Corporation D, which sold trusts and insurance products to Washington consumers. Consumers purchasing trusts from Corporation D also received Corporation Câ€™s pre-paid legal plan. During the period he was affiliated with Corporations C and D, Mr. Scaringi engaged in the following conduct that established grounds for discipline:â€¢  Failing to properly supervise non-lawyers with whom he was affiliated in the provision of estate planning services;â€¢  Assisting in the unauthorized practice of law by affiliating himself with non-lawyers who marketed living trusts and other estate planning products to the public and were permitted to perform legal functions;â€¢  Providing legal services to clients procured with the assistance of Corporations C and D without fully disclosing to clients his own interest in maintaining a continuing business relationship with these entities and without obtaining informed consent from his clients. Mr. Scaringiâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer's own interests unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after consultation and a full disclosure of the material facts; RPC 5.3(b), requiring a lawyer with direct supervisory authority over a nonlawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the nonlawyerâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; and RPC 5.3(c), holding a lawyer responsible for the conduct of a nonlawyer assistant that would be a violation of the RPCs if engaged in by a lawyer in circumstances where the lawyer orders or ratifies the conduct or fails to take reasonable remedial action; and RPC 5.5(b), prohibiting a lawyer from assisting a person who is not a member of the Bar in the performance of activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.Kevin Bank represented the Bar Association.

This discipline was based on his lack of diligence and misrepresentation in a client matter in 2001.In January 2001, Mr. Mullen agreed to assist a client with a petition to increase the client's summer child visitation and to modify child-support payments. By May 2001, Mr. Mullen had drafted the petition, but had not filed anything with the court. When the client called, Mr. Mullen explained that he had filed the pleadings and attended hearings. These statements were not true. Mr. Mullen also fabricated time entries on the billing statements he mailed to his client. He charged the client $168 for services he did not perform. In September 2001, Mr. Mullen obtained two ex parte orders of child support without notice to the opposing party. Mr. Mullen had no legal basis for obtaining these orders. Mr. Mullen did not file either of the original orders with the court. In October 2001, the court vacated the second order.

Mr. Clark filed the complaint, but then failed to timely exchange the required witness and exhibit lists.  The court entered an order excluding the clientâ€™s witnesses and Mr. Clark filed a motion for reconsideration of this order.

52.html,1589,Nelson Christensen,,Disbarment,3/21/1997,,"Seattle lawyer Nelson L. Christensen (WSBA No.1589, admitted 1967) has been ordered disbarred by the Washington Supreme Court following review of a Stipulation to Discipline. Christensen had been on interim suspension since June 21, 1995. The discipline is based on Christensenâ€™s abandonment of his practice and mishandling of more than $300,000 of client funds.Abandonment of practiceChristensen operated a law office as a sole practitioner with a general practice oriented to real estate matters. In early 1995, serious shortages in Christensen's trust funds began to surface.On Friday, May 12, 1995, Christensen left his office and flew to New Zealand. Prior to his departure, he did not inform his clients of his intention to be away from his office or to leave his practice. He also did not so inform his employee or any of the other lawyers in his office suite nor did he notify his clients of his inability to continue their representation, nor did he make any arrangements for any other lawyer to assist his clients in retrieving their files or continuing their representation. Christensen took no action to protect the interests of his clients during his absence. Christensen returned to Seattle 15 months after he left, in August 1996.Mishandling of Client FundsMatter 1:Mr. Christensen was retained to act as the escrow/closing agent for the sale of an apartment building. In connection with that closing, in 1995, Christensen received into his trust account $91,973.17, from which various disbursements were to be made to effectuate the closing. Christensen made disbursements totaling $82,104.03 in connection with this closing; the remaining $9,869.14 was not disbursed. In the settlement statement provided to the parties, Christensen stated that several disbursals had been made when, in fact, those disbursals had not been. Christensen converted to his own use, by paying to other clients or disbursing for his own benefit, the $9,869.14.Also in connection with this transaction, Christensen negotiated a Sales Commission Agreement whereby the purchaser agreed to pay to the real estate agent a sales commission of $40,000. On May 9, 1995, the purchaser delivered to Christensen the signed Sales Commission Agreement, along with the purchaser's check for $40,000, payable to the Nelson Christensen Trust Account. On May 9, 1995, Christensen deposited the $40,000 into his trust account. Christensen then converted those funds by using them to make disbursals from his trust account to other clients and for Christensenâ€™s own benefit.Christensen told the real estate agent that he could not disburse the funds from his trust account until Friday, May 12, 1995, and made an appointment for the agent to return at 2:30 p.m. on that day. When the agent arrived for his appointment, Christensen was gone, having departed his office for the flight to New Zealand hours beforehand. Christensen has not disbursed the funds to the agent.Matter 2:Christensen was retained to act as the escrow/closing agent for the sale of a tavern. In connection with that closing, in 1995, Christensen received into his trust account $21,341.59 from the purchaser. The escrow instructions provided that $19,047.45 of these funds were to be disbursed to the owners of the building housing the tavern, for back rent and taxes owing. Christensen made disbursals in connection with this closing totaling $1,836.77; the remaining $19,504.82, including the money due the building owners, was not disbursed in connection with this closing. Christensen converted this money to his own use by paying to other clients or disbursing for his own benefit.Matter 3:Christensen was retained in March1994 to probate an estate. In December 1994, Christensen received into his trust account $194,113.16 for disbursal to the heirs and to pay his fees of $7,000. After paying his fees and making disbursals to several of the heirs, Christensen converted to his own use by paying to other clients or disbursing for his own benefit funds in his trust account in the amount of $107,994.91 due the heirs.On March 24, 1995, Christensen provided one heir with a $70,000 check drawn on his general office account. When that check was deposited by the heir on April 14, 1995, it was returned to her unpaid due to insufficient funds. On April 5, 1995, Christensen provided the same heir with a check drawn on his general-office account in the amount of$28,941.20 which was honored by Christensenâ€™s bank. On May 9, 1995, Christensen provided this heir with a cashier's check for $20,000 which Christensen obtained by a check drawn on his trust account in the amount of $20,003 using the funds of other clients.The remaining balance of $59,050.71 due the heirs remains unpaid.Matter 4:Christensen was retained to act as the escrow/closing agent for the sale of real property. In connection with that closing, in 1995, Christensen received into his trust account $45,407.51 from the purchasers, from which various disbursements were to be made to effectuate the closing. Christensen disbursed a total of $38,431.55 in connection with this closing; the remaining $6,975.96 was not disbursed. In the settlement statement provided to the parties, Christensen stated that several disbursals had been made when in fact those disbursals had not been made. Christensen converted to his own use, by paying to other clients or disbursing for his own benefit, the remaining $6,975.96.Matter 5:Christensen was retained to act as the escrow/closing agent for the sale of real property. In connection with that closing, in 1995, Christensen received into his trust account $47,143.83 from the purchasers, from which various disbursements were to be made to effectuate the closing. Christensen disbursed a total of $44,241.85 in connection with this closing; the remaining $2,901.98 was not disbursed. In the settlement statement provided to the parties, Christensen stated that several disbursals had been made when in fact those disbursals had not been made. Christensen converted to his own use, by paying to other clients or disbursing for his own benefit, the remaining $2,901.98.Matter 6:On March 18, 1994, Christensen was appointed as special administrator of an estate; he was later appointed personal representative of the estate. In the course of his duties as personal representative, Christensen came in to possession of $158,314.87 of funds belonging to the estate.Without the knowledge, authorization or permission of the court, the attorney for the estate, or the heirs of the estate, Christensen removed funds in his accounts from the estate and/or diverted funds received on behalf of the estate and converted to his own use estate funds in the amount of at least $57,000 by transferring the funds to non-estate accounts where they were disbursed for the benefit of other clients and/or the benefit of Christensen.Matter 7:Christensen was retained to act as escrow/closing agent in the sale of real property. In connection with this escrow, in 1995, Christensen received into his trust account $3,000 as earnest money. No disbursals were made in connection with this escrow. Christensen converted the escrow funds by paying these funds to other clients or disbursing these funds for his own benefit.Matter 8:Christensen was retained to act as escrow/closing agent in the sale of a business. In connection with this escrow, in 1995, Christensen received into his trust account $10,000 as escrow money. No disbursals were made in connection with this escrow. Christensen converted the escrow funds by paying these funds to other clients or disbursing these funds for his own benefit.Matter 9:Christensen was retained to act as the attorney for a purchaser in a real estate sale and exchange pursuant to IRS Code Section 1031. In 1995, the purchaser deposited $25,543.34 to Christensen's trust account to be used in this transaction. No disbursals were made in connection with this transaction. Christensen converted these escrow funds by paying these funds to other clients or disbursing these funds for his own benefit.Matter 1O: Christensen was retained to act as escrow agent in the sale of a motel. In 1995, the purchaser deposited $50,000 into Christensen's trust account as escrow money. No disbursals were made by Christensen in connection with this transaction. Christensen converted these escrow funds by paying these funds to other clients or disbursing these funds for his own benefit.Matter 11:Beginning in at least 1990, Christensen provided a variety of legal services to a husband and wife. The husband passed away in 1993, when the wife was in her mid-70s. Christensen maintained an attorney-client relationship with the wife until the time of Christensenâ€™s departure to New Zealand in May 1995.Prior to 1993, the couple had invested proceeds from the sale of their home into an investment company. By 1993, the couple was dissatisfied with this investment and sought to terminate it. In October 1993, Christensen contacted the couple and suggested they invest in a piece of residential real estate as soon as they obtained a refund from the investment company, which they agreed to do. Christensen then wrote to the investment company and advised the company that he would pick up the check himself. Christensen obtained a check from the investment company made out to himself in the amount of $52,696.70, which he deposited into his trust account on October 18, 1993. This transaction is referred to as ""Loan 1.""Christensen did not execute a deed of trust or a promissory note in regard to ""Loan 1"" although he did draft and the couple did sign a document entitled ""2nd Deed of Trust Agreement."" This document described the transaction as an investment of $52,000 for 12 months, with monthly interest payments at 12%. The monies in ""Loan 1"" were not, in fact, used for investments but were in fact used by Christensen to fund disbursements to other clients. Christensen did not advise the couple that their money in ""Loan 1"" would not be used to fund any investment in real estate but was, in fact, a loan to himself which would be used to make disbursals to other clients. Christensen did not advise the couple to seek independent counsel concerning the transaction in ""Loan 1."" The monies borrowed in ""Loan 1"" have not been repaid.In March 1994, Christensen approached the then widowed wife and suggested that she invest $60,000 in additional real estate, which she agreed to do. Christensen received an additional $50,586.11 from the widow, which he deposited into his trust account on April 11, 1994. This transaction is referred to as ""Loan 2.""Christensen did execute a promissory note for ""Loan 2"" and executed, but did not record, a deed of trust for this transaction. The monies in ""Loan 2"" were not, in fact, used for investments but were, in fact, used by Mr. Christensen to fund disbursements to other clients. Christensen did not advise the widow how her money in ""Loan 2"" would actually be used. Christensen also did not advise her to seek independent counsel concerning the transaction in ""Loan 2."" The monies borrowed in ""Loan 2"" have not been repaid.In June 1994, Christensen approached the widow requesting an additional loan of $25,000. She gave Christensen a check for $25, ""Loan 3."" Christensen did not advise the widow to seek independent counsel in regards to ""Loan 3."" Christensen used the monies received in ""Loan 3"" to fund disbursals to other clients. On July 8, 1994, Christensen repaid ""Loan 3,"" with interest, using the funds of another client.On January 24, 1995, Christensen went to the home of the widow, who had returned that same day from a hospital stay due to her heart condition, and requested an additional $40,000 loan. She gave Christensen a $40,000 check, which he deposited into his personal account on January 25, 1995. This transaction is referred to as ""Loan 4."" The monies obtained through ""Loan 4"" were then used to purchase a cashierâ€™s check to disburse funds to another client whose funds had previously been deposited in Christensenâ€™s trust account. Christensen did not advise the widow to seek independent counsel in regards to ""Loan 4."" The monies obtained through ""Loan 4"" have not been repaid.Matter 12:On April 22, 1995, Christensen issued three checks payable to himself. One check was drawn in his capacity as personal representative of the estate described above in Matter 6 in the amount of $20,000; two checks were drawn on his personal checking account, one in the amount of $37,000 and one in the amount of $35,000. On the same day, Christensen, without endorsing the three checks, deposited them into his general office account at his bank. At the time he drew and deposited these three checks, Christensen knew that there were not sufficient funds in the accounts on which they were drawn. Christensen used the deposit of the three checks totaling $92,000 to fund in part the purchase on the same day of a $133,000 cashierâ€™s check for use in completing an escrow transaction for which he had previously received funds into his trust account but had converted to his own use.On April 25, 1995, the three checks totaling $92,000 were dishonored for insufficient funds.The bank having insufficient recourse against the cashierâ€™s check, suffered a loss and filed suit in King County Superior Court. On June 27, 1995, the bank obtained a judgment against Christensen in the amount of $85,405.57.MisconductChristensenâ€™s abandonment of his practice violated Rule of Professional Conduct (""RPC"") 1.4, RPC 1.15(a)(2) and/or RPC 1.15(d).Christensenâ€™s conduct as described in Matters 1 through 9 in converting funds constitutes acts involving moral turpitude and/or dishonesty and/or corruption and/or violated RPC 8.4(c) and/or RPC 8.4(d) and/or RPC 1.14.Christensenâ€™s conduct as described in Matters 1 through 9 in misrepresenting to parties that disbursals had been made and that money was available to make disbursals constitutes a violation of RPC 1.4(a) and/or RPC 1.4(b) and/or RPC 8.4(c) and/or RPC 8.4(d).Christensenâ€™s conduct in entering into four loan transactions with clients on terms which were not fair and reasonable and/ or without fully disclosing in writing all terms of the loan and/or without providing the clients with a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel violated RPC 1.8(a).Christensenâ€™s conduct in misrepresenting the nature of two loans made to him by clients violated RPC 8.4(c).Christensenâ€™s conduct in drawing and depositing checks he knew to be insufficient for the purpose of obtaining certified funds from a bank constitutes an act involving moral turpitude and/or dishonesty and/or corruption and/or violated RPC 8.4 (c).Christensenâ€™s conduct in abandoning his practice and as described in Matters 1-12 above demonstrate an unfitness to practice law pursuant to RLD 1.1(p).StipulationChristensen and the WSBA stipulated that he should be disbarred. The parties further stipulated that prior to applying for reinstatement to the practice of law, Christensen shall make full restitution. Full restitution was agreed to be $394,200.60, as well as satisfaction of any additional civil judgments or court ordered restitution assessed against Christensen based on the facts outlined above.The hearing officer was G.

Luke Kim (WSBA No. 28330, admitted 1998), of California, received a reprimand on July 25, 2003, following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board.  This discipline was based on his conduct in 2002 during an arbitration hearing.In March 2002, Mr. Kim represented clients in an arbitration hearing.  One of the issues in the hearing was whether Mr. Kim was present during a meeting with an insurance adjuster.  Mr. Kim testified at the hearing about this meeting.  Mr. Kim subpoenaed Mr. G to testify at the arbitration.  When Mr. G arrived, Mr. Kim had a private conversation with him.  Following this private conversation, Mr. Kim told the arbitrator and opposing counsel that Mr. G received an emergency call and had to leave without testifying.  This statement was not true.  The opposing party called Mr. G and learned that there was no emergency call. Mr. G returned to the hearing and testified that Mr. Kim had told him to leave.  Mr. Kim admitted his conduct and made an apology.Mr. Kimâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 3.3(a), prohibiting knowingly making a false statement of fact to the tribunal; 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; and 3.7 prohibiting lawyers from testifying in proceedings in which they represent a party.Christine Gray represented the Bar Association.

This discipline is based on his conduct in 1999 in a criminal matter involving a client facing deportation.In 1999, a client retained Mr. Kolin to represent her son.  The son was a Russian citizen and had pled guilty to four criminal offenses.  The client did not want her son to be deported and asked Mr. Kolin for an opinion about the likelihood of getting the charges reduced.  Mr. Kolin charged the client $6,000.  The client paid $3,200.  Mr. Kolin signed an affidavit and wrote one letter to the prosecutor asking to amend two of the charges to which the son pled guilty.  Mr. Kolin did not tell the client that it was unlikely that the prosecutor would agree to reduce the felony charges to misdemeanors prior to writing the letter.  The prosecutor did not agree to reduce the charges.  In May 2000, the son was deported.  The Hearing Officer found that the reasonable value of Mr. Kolinâ€™s work was $1,000.  Mr. Kolinâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.5(a), requiring lawyerâ€™s fees to be reasonable; 1.2(a) requiring lawyers to abide by the clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of the representation; and 1.1, requiring lawyers to provide competent representation.

526.html,5328,Glenn Reed,,Disbarment,7/1/2003,,"Glenn E. Reed (WSBA No. 5328, admitted 1973), of Tucson, AZ, was disbarred effective July 1, 2003, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court approving a stipulation. Mr. Reed stipulated to a substantial likelihood that the Association would prove these facts at a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2001 and 2002, involving theft of client funds and writing checks on closed accounts. Matter 1: In 2001, Mr. Reed received a client's settlement check, and agreed to deposit the check in his trust account and pay the client's medical bills. Mr. Reed deposited the check into his trust account, but used the money for his own benefit. Mr. Reed gave the client false responses to his questions about why Mr. Reed had not yet paid the client's medical bills. In February 2002, the bank closed Mr. Reed's IOLTA account apparently due to insufficient funds to cover items presented. As of the date of the stipulation, Mr. Reed had not paid the medical bills or delivered the settlement funds to the client.Matter 2: In May 2002, the Association received notification that Mr. Reed's trust account was overdrawn. The bank stated that the account had been opened in February 2002, with a $10 deposit and then had over $5,000 in returned checks in a 10-day period in May 2002. The bank did not receive any deposits to cover the checks. Mr. Reed wrote a $4,500 check against this account and then stopped payment on the check that same day. He also wrote several checks to local businesses knowing that he did not have funds in the account to meet the checks when presented. This account was not set up as an IOLTA account. Matter 3: Between June 20 and June 24, 2002, Mr. Reed wrote nine checks to a grocery store, totaling $564.75, and seven checks to a market, totaling $490.56. Mr. Reed wrote all of these checks on an account that he knew was closed. Some of the checks were written for more than the amount of the purchase, so Mr. Reed could obtain cash. Mr. Reed stipulated that his actions were part of a common scheme or plan with the intent to defraud the grocery and the market. As of the date of the stipulation, Mr. Reed had not paid all of the money owing. Mr. Reed's conduct violated RPCs 8.4(b), prohibiting committing a criminal act [theft] that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Jean McElroy represented the Bar Association.

Trejo Jr. (WSBA No. 19758, admitted 1990), of Yakima, received a reprimand, and was ordered to pay approximately $6,500 restitution, on June 6, 2003, following a hearing. This discipline is based on his failing to diligently represent four clients, and charging excessive fees in 1997 and 1998.Matter 1: In 1997, Mr. Trejo agreed to represent a client serving jail time to satisfy a fine imposed for committing two misdemeanors. The family paid Mr. Trejo $2,000 to begin the representation. Mr. Trejo instructed his staff to contact the municipal court for the cost of the record and met with the family to request additional fees. He took little or no other action on the case. He did not file a notice of appearance or a notice of appeal. Mr. Trejo refused the family's request to refund the fees paid. Mr. Trejo's conduct in this matter violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; and 1.5(a), requiring lawyers to charge reasonable fees.Matter 2: In 1997, Mr. Trejo agreed to represent a client in a sentencing hearing and an appeal of the client's felony convictions in Oregon. Mr. Trejo was not admitted to practice law in Oregon. The family paid Mr. Trejo $6,000. Mr. Trejo reviewed one of two sets of indictments, judgments, and sentencing orders, and did not contact trial counsel or review the transcript. Mr. Trejo determined an issue on appeal may exist and asked for additional funds to attend the sentencing or begin an appeal. Other counsel represented the client at the sentencing and on appeal. The family requested a refund of the fees they had paid. Mr. Trejo initially refused, claiming that he had been paid only $3,000. Mr. Trejo refunded $3,000 after acknowledging in a disciplinary deposition that he had been paid $6,000. Mr. Trejo's conduct in this matter violated RPCs 1.5(a) and (b), requiring lawyers to charge reasonable fees and to explain the basis for the fees; 1.1 and 1.3, requiring lawyers to competently represent their clients; 1.14(a) and (b), requiring lawyers to deposit client funds into an IOLTA trust account and deliver client funds promptly when requested; and 1.15(d), requiring lawyers to take reasonable steps to protect a client's interests upon withdrawal.Matter 3: In 1998, Mr. Trejo agreed to represent a client in a criminal appeal in Oregon. Mr. Trejo was not admitted to practice law in Oregon. The client's mother paid Mr. Trejo $4,000. Mr. Trejo performed a limited review of the case, prepared one short memo, and asked for an additional $6,000 to begin the appeal. Mr. Trejo refused to refund the fee, claiming it was non-refundable. Mr. Trejo's conduct in this matter violated RPCs 1.1, 1.3, and 1.5(a) and (b).Matter 4: In 1998, Mr. Trejo agreed to represent a client charged with a felony in Texas. Mr. Trejo was not admitted to practice law in Texas. Mr. Trejo retained local Texas counsel, but asked that he sponsor Mr. Trejo only when Mr. Trejo appeared in court. Mr. Trejo filed a notice of appearance, but took no further action until April 1999. By that time, the court had issued a warrant for the client's arrest and ordered his bond forfeited. The family asked for a refund of the $4,000 they had paid. Mr. Trejo refused, claiming the fees were nonrefundable. Mr. Trejo's conduct in this matter violated RPCs 1.1, 1.3, and 1.5(a) and (b).Matter 5: Mr. Trejo failed to timely cooperate with the Bar Association investigation of three of these matters. Mr. Trejo's conduct in this matter violated RLD 2.8 (now ELC 5.3(e)).Gregory F. Wesner and Claire Foley represented the Bar Association at hearing, and Douglas Ende represented the Bar Association on appeal.

Johnston (WSBA No. 23630, admitted 1994), of Seattle, was ordered to receive a reprimand, following a stipulation approved by Hearing Officer Lawrence R. Mills.  This discipline is based on her conduct in 1999 involving lack of competence and diligence in a litigation matter.In 1999, two of Ms. Johnsonâ€™s clients were served with copies of a summons and complaint.  The clients were named as defendants in a breach of contract claim.  Ms. Johnson told the clients that she would take care of the matter.  The complaint had not yet been filed in court.  Ms. Johnston mistakenly believed that the plaintiffs were required to provide notice prior to taking a default judgment in the lawsuit.  Ms. Johnston did not contact opposing counsel, file a notice of appearance or file an answer.  In June 1999, plaintiffs obtained a default judgment against Ms. Johnstonâ€™s clients.  When the clients inquired about the matter, Ms. Johnston assured them it was taken care of, without actually checking.  If Ms. Johnston had checked, she would have discovered the default judgment.  The clients learned of the judgment in January 2001, after the time period for a Civil Rule 60(b)(1) motion to vacate judgment had passed.Ms. Johnstonâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.1, requiring lawyers to provide competent representation; 1.3, requiring lawyers to provide diligent representation; 1.4(a), requiring lawyers to keep their clients informed of the status of their matters; and 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from making negligent misrepresentations.

Smith (WSBA No. 11185, admitted 1980), of Falls City, was ordered to receive a reprimand, following a stipulation approved by Hearing Officer Nancy K. McCoid.  This discipline is based on his conduct in 2000 involving lack of diligence and charging an unreasonable fee in an immigration matter.In March or April 2000, Mr. Smith agreed to represent a client in an immigration matter.

The discipline is based upon his engaging in a consensual sexual relationship with a client and denying that relationship under oath.In 1995, the Kitsap County Superior Court assigned a law firm to represent a client charged with second-degree assault. The firm assigned the case to Mr. Keys. The client, who had a history of being battered by her husband, allegedly shot a handgun in the husbandâ€™s general direction.In May or June 1995, while preparing for trial, Mr. Keys and the client entered a consensual sexual relationship. Mr. Keys delivered handwritten, intimate notes and gifts to the client, and offered to assist her in ending her marriage after the criminal case was concluded. During their relationship, Mr. Keys advised the client to accept a plea agreement to third-degree assault. The client received a sentence giving her credit for time served, requiring community service, and placing her on probation for one year. Mr. Keys represented the client at all court hearings. The client believed that the plea would end the case.During the probation, the client realized that she had not fully understood the consequences of her plea agreement and had followed Mr. Keysâ€™ advice because of their personal relationship. On July 10, 1996, the client wrote to the court asking to withdraw her guilty plea. The court appointed a new lawyer and held a hearing on the clientâ€™s request to withdraw her guilty plea. At the hearing, Mr. Keys denied under oath that he had a sexual relationship with the client or that he wrote the 10 intimate notes to the client. The court granted the clientâ€™s motion.Mr. Keysâ€™ conduct violated RPCs 1.7(b), prohibiting representing a client if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes that the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after full disclosure; 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; 8.4(d), prohibiting engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RLD 1.1(a), prohibiting conduct reflecting disregard for the rule of law.Harold Vhugen represented the Bar Association.

Hutchinson (WSBA No. 14389, admitted 1984), of Vancouver, WA, was disbarred effective August 20, 2003, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court approving a stipulation. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2000 and 2002, involving false statements in a declaration, practicing while his license was suspended, and lack of diligence and communication in two client matters.Matter 1: On April 15, 2000, Mr. Hutchinson agreed to represent a client involved in an auto accident. The client received a demand letter from the other driver's insurance company. Mr. Hutchinson's response to the insurance company contained factual errors. In September 2001, the other driver served the client with a lawsuit. Mr. Hutchinson met with the client and drafted a notice of appearance and answer, but did not notify opposing counsel that he was involved in the case or file the pleadings with the court. In November 2001, the court entered a $4,335.29 default judgment against the client. In January 2002, the Department of Licensing suspended the client's driver license for failure to satisfy the judgment. Mr. Hutchinson did not respond to the client's phone calls or written messages.

In April 2002, Mr. Hutchinson noted a hearing and told opposing counsel that he would send a proposed QDRO the following week. Mr. Hutchinson did not send opposing counsel a proposed QDRO and agreed to strike the hearing.

Matter 3: On November 8, 2002, the Bar Association filed a petition with the Washington State Supreme Court asking for Mr. Hutchinson's immediate interim suspension, based on his failure to cooperate with the disciplinary investigations. Mr. Hutchinson failed to respond to the show-cause order by the date required, so, on January 10, 2003, the Court struck the hearing and stated that the matter would be considered without oral argument. On January 16, 2003, Mr. Hutchinson filed pleadings with the Court stating falsely that he had refunded the clients' flat-fee retainers. On January 17, 2003, the Court issued an order suspending Mr. Hutchinson's license.Matter 4: Despite the Court's order suspending his license, Mr. Hutchinson appeared in court and signed pleadings on January 22, 2003.Mr. Hutchinson's conduct violated RPCs 1.4(a), by failing to adequately inform clients about the status of their cases; 1.4(b), by failing to explain matters to the extent reasonably necessary for clients to make informed decisions; 1.3, by failing to serve his notice of appearance and answer, failing to file the motion to vacate judgment, and failing to obtain a QDRO; 1.5 and 1.15(d), by failing to return unearned and unreasonable fees; 3.3(a) and 8.4(c), by falsely stating in a declaration that he had refunded his clients' retainers; and 5.5(e), by signing pleadings after his license to practice had been suspended; and RLD 2.8(a) [now ELC 5.3(e)], by failing to cooperate with the disciplinary process.

This discipline was based on his conduct between 1999 and 2001 involving theft of client funds and acts of misconduct in five personal-injury and litigation matters.Matter 1: In October 1999, Mr. Hernandez agreed to represent a client in a personal-injury matter. The verbal fee agreement was that Mr. Hernandez's fees would be an unspecified percentage of the client's recovery. The client's case settled and Mr. Hernandez received the $5,809 settlement check.

Mr. Hernandez refused to disclose the location of his law office and failed to return the client's calls to his cellular phone. In September 2000, the client retained substitute counsel. In January 2001, Mr. Hernandez sent a settlement-demand package to the insurance company. The client did not authorize or review this settlement demand. Mr. Hernandez was not authorized to act as the client's lawyer at this time. The client asked Mr. Hernandez to send a letter of withdrawal to the insurance company, but he did not do so. Matter 4: On March 15, 2001, Mr. Hernandez agreed to represent a client on a municipal-court traffic charge. Mr. Hernandez failed to appear for the client's pretrial conference three times. The court continued the hearing twice so that he could attend. Mr. Hernandez did not respond to the client's phone calls or refund his legal fees. The client retained new counsel.Matter 5: In early 2001, Mr. Hernandez agreed to represent a client in a criminal matter. Mr. Hernandez failed to appear for the court-ordered motion and jury call dates. The court clerk notified Mr. Hernandez by phone of the client's April 5, 2001, hearing, but Mr. Hernandez failed to appear.

The state filed a motion for sanctions against Mr. Hernandez for repeatedly failing to appear, and the court issued an order requiring his appearance. Mr. Hernandez called the court during the sanctions hearing and stated that his car had broken down on the pass. The court found Mr. Hernandez in contempt and imposed terms of $750. Mr. Hernandez did not pay the terms. Mr. Hernandez promised to return the client's $1,500 fee payment, but never did so. Mr. Hernandez did not cooperate with the disciplinary investigation into these matters.

Schmidt (WSBA No. 14677, admitted 1984), of Yakima, was disbarred effective September 11, 2003, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 1999 and 2001 involving practicing with a suspended license, lack of diligence in four client matters, theft of client funds, and filing a false answer in the disciplinary proceeding. Matter 1: The Washington State Supreme Court suspended Mr. Schmidt's license to practice law, effective July 24, 2001, for failure to pay WSBA license fees. During a July 26, 2001, deposition, Mr. Schmidt stated falsely under oath that he had ""written to the Bar and sent them a check."" At the time of his suspension, Mr. Schmidt had contracts to represent clients for the Yakima County Department of Assigned Counsel (DAC). Mr. Schmidt did not notify DAC, his clients, or opposing counsel of his suspension. Mr. Schmidt knowingly continued to represent several clients during his suspension.

Mr. Schmidt did not prepare the list or promptly return the files. Matter 2: In 1987, Mr. Schmidt represented a client in a Labor and Industries claim. Mr. Schmidt set up a living trust for the client's L&I pension and Social Security Supplemental Disability Insurance payments. Mr. Schmidt managed the client's trust. In January 2000, Mr. Schmidt deposited one of the client's checks into his IOLTA account and did not transfer any of the funds to the client. Matter 3: In November 1999, Mr. Schmidt became the trustee for a minor child, when the mother died. Mr. Schmidt opened an account for the child using the mother's life-insurance proceeds. In April 2000, Mr. Schmidt transferred $15,000 from the child's account into an account held for another client. He then took $100 of this money in cash, transferred $5,900 to his personal bank account, and transferred $5,000 into his law-office account. Mr. Schmidt depleted the remaining $4,000 in small increments for other clients. During the investigation of this matter, Mr. Schmidt falsely told disciplinary counsel that the $15,000 were his ""personal funds from an inheritance in the amount of $15,000 which were mistakenly deposited into [the client's] account."" Disciplinary counsel subpoenaed Mr. Schmidt to appear at a deposition and produce proof of his inheritance claim. Mr. Schmidt failed to appear for the deposition.Matter 4: Mr. Schmidt represented a client who was injured in a May 1997 automobile accident. Mr. Schmidt notified the insurance company that he represented the client, but took no further action. The insurance company closed its file when the statute of limitations expired on the client's claim.

Mr. Healy refused to endorse the check unless the new counsel agreed to make no disbursements without Mr. Healy's agreement. The new counsel agreed, believing that the dispute would be resolved quickly. Mr. Healy never disputed that the client was entitled to at least $70,000 of the settlement funds. Mr. Healy refused to agree to release the undisputed funds until about January 2002.Mr. Healy's conduct violated Rule 4-100 (B)(4) of the California Rules of Professional Conduct, requiring lawyers to promptly pay client funds to clients upon request.

This discipline was based on conflicts on interest and contacting represented parties in a corporate-dissolution matter.Mr. Henderson represented an interior-design business. Mr. Henderson's wife (S) and another person (G) each owned half the stock in the business. In May 1993, a dispute arose between S and G, and they began to discuss dissolving the business. Mr. Henderson advised the business on this dispute on one occasion, but did not disclose to his client that his judgment might be affected by his marital relationship to one of the shareholders. By June 1993, G retained counsel and Mr. Henderson continued to represent the corporation and S individually. The corporation's interest in continuing to exist may have conflicted with S's interest in dissolving the corporation. Mr. Henderson did not disclose this conflict to his clients. In July 1993, Mr. Henderson knew that G was represented by counsel, but he communicated directly with her on corporate matters. Mr. Henderson's conduct violated DRs 5-101(A), by giving advice about dissolving to a two-shareholder corporation while married to one of the shareholders, without disclosure of the conflict and consent to continue the representation; 10-101(B), by continuing to represent the corporation and S individually when their interests were likely conflicting, without disclosing the conflict or obtaining consent to continue the representation; and 7-104(A)(1), by contacting G directly when he knew that she was represented by counselFelice Congalton represented the Bar Association.

55.html,16129,Grace Wagner,,Censure,4/21/2000,,"Grace Wagner (WSBA No. 16129, admitted 1986), of Snohomish County, was ordered censured following a hearing. This discipline is based on Ms. Wagnerâ€™s failure to perform and communicate with a client, and failure to disclose a material fact to a third party.In 1990, Ms. Wagner finalized a clientâ€™s (Mr. T) dissolution action. In December 1991, she entered a real estate transaction with this client. On December 24, 1991, Ms. Wagner signed a real estate purchase and sale agreement for a house (the Lombard house). She paid the $1,000 earnest money deposit with a promissory note signed ""for Mr. T."" Mr. T was denied the bank loan for the purchase.In February 1992, a second dissolution client (Mr. S) invested in the Lombard house with Mr. T. Together the two clients obtained a HUD loan and signed closing papers on April 14, 1992. Just prior to the transfer of funds, Mr. S. had second thoughts, and Ms. Wagner advised him of several ways to get out of the deal. Mr. T also spoke to Ms. Wagner about getting out of the deal.Upon Ms. Wagnerâ€™s suggestion, Mr. T donated the house to an Everett charity. Ms. Wagner paid the bank $7,444.69 to close the transaction and considered this a donation to the charity. Mr. T and Mr. S signed quit-claim deeds transferring their interests to the charity. Ms. Wagner did not advise either client of their continuing liability for the mortgage, and took no steps to advise the bank of the transfer. HUD, which allows acceleration of the mortgage if the debtor transfers the property without prior HUD approval, will not normally approve a transfer if the successor will not occupy the property as a primary or secondary residence.On June 4, 1992, Mr. Tâ€™s former spouse filed a petition for modification of spousal support. Ms. Wagner represented Mr. T in this matter. At his deposition on September 23, 1992, Mr. T testified about his real property in Gold Bar. Opposing counsel asked him if he owned other property or had purchased and sold any real estate since July 1990. Mr. T responded that he had not, because he did not believe he had sold the Lombard house. Ms. Wagner took no steps to correct Mr. Tâ€™s deposition testimony. In early December 1992, the former spouse learned of Mr. Tâ€™s involvement in the Lombard house. The arbitrator increased the spousal maintenance, based in part on Mr. Tâ€™s failure to disclose the Lombard house transaction.Ms. Wagnerâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring lawyers to competently represent their clients; RPC 1.4(b), requiring lawyers to explain matters to clients to the extent necessary to allow the client to make an informed decision; RPC 3.4(c), requiring lawyers to comply with lawful discovery requests; and RPC 4.1(b), requiring lawyers to disclose material facts to third parties.Joanne Abelson represented the Bar Association.

551.html,25217,Karl Ferrier,,Disbarment,10/29/2003,,"Karl W. Ferrier (WSBA No. 25217, admitted 1995), of Ocean Park, was disbarred effective October 29, 2003, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 1999 and 2001, involving theft of client funds and lack of diligence, and making false statements during the disciplinary investigation. Matters 1 and 2: In April 2000 and March 2001, Mr. Ferrier agreed to represent clients. In both cases, he deposited the clients' advance fee deposit into his business or personal bank account and used the money for his own purposes. Mr. Ferrier did not work on the clients' cases, respond to the clients' requests that he return their files, refund their fees, or provide accountings.Matter 3: In March 2001, Mr. Ferrier agreed to represent a client in an action to collect on a promissory note. Mr. Ferrier deposited the client's advance fee deposit into his business or general account and used it for his own purposes. Mr. Ferrier filed a complaint on the client's behalf; paid the filing fee; arranged for service of process on the defendant; and received, but did not file, the affidavit of service. The defendant did not file an answer to the lawsuit, but Mr. Ferrier told his client that he was too busy to obtain an order of default. After August 1, 2001, Mr. Ferrier did not communicate with his client. The client retained new counsel. Although new counsel requested that he do so, Mr. Ferrier did not file the affidavit of service within 90 days of filing the complaint. During the investigatory deposition of this matter, Mr. Ferrier made two false statements under oath. Matter 4: In September 1999, Mr. Ferrier agreed to represent clients in a lawsuit against a roofing contractor. Mr. Ferrier deposited $900 of the clients' $1,000 advance fee deposit in his trust account. He filed the clients' lawsuit, but failed to timely answer discovery requests, incurring $400 in sanctions. He also failed to advise his clients that opposing counsel had offered to discuss settlement and had scheduled the clients' depositions. Neither Mr. Ferrier nor the clients appeared at the depositions. When Mr. Ferrier failed to appear at opposing counsel's subsequent motion for discovery sanctions, the court sent notice of the hearing directly to the clients. The clients appeared and indicated they could not contact Mr. Ferrier. The court imposed an additional $2,000 in sanctions. Mr. Ferrier did not cooperate with the investigation of these disciplinary matters. Mr. Ferrier's conduct violated RPCs 8.4(b) and (c), by committing theft (embezzlement of client funds); 1.14(a), by failing to deposit client funds in an IOLTA account; 1.14(b)(3), by failing to provide accountings of client funds upon request; 1.5(a), by failing to perform legal services and retaining advance fee deposits; 1.15(d), by failing to return client files and unearned fees upon termination of the representation; 1.3, by failing to diligently represent clients; and 1.4 (a) and (b), by failing to answer client phone calls and letters, preventing clients from being informed about the status of their matters; and RLD 2.8 [now ELC 5.3(e)], by failing to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation.Kevin Bank represented the Bar Association.

553.html,22918,Randy Fair,,Suspension,10/29/2003,,"Randy J. Fair (WSBA No. 22918, admitted 1993), of Moses Lake, was suspended for one year, effective October 29, 2003, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court, approving a stipulation. This discipline was based on conflicts of interest and trust-account issues in a marital dissolution matter in 2001 and a wrongful garnishment in 2002.Matter 1: In 2001, Lawyer A worked in the same law office as Mr. Fair. Lawyer A represented clients in a real estate contract forfeiture action. On January 20, 2001, Lawyer A served Ms. R with a notice of forfeiture on two lots. Ms. R lived in a mobile home on these lots. Ms. R met with Lawyer A regarding the forfeiture. During this meeting, Ms. R expressed dissatisfaction with her dissolution lawyer. Lawyer A referred Ms. R to Mr. Fair. Ms. R told Mr. Fair that she wanted title to the two real estate parcels in the property division and explained that she was concerned about the forfeiture. Mr. Fair reviewed documents, including the forfeiture notice signed by Lawyer A. Mr. Fair did not explain to Ms. R that his office represented the sellers of the two lots in the forfeiture action. Mr. Fair did not obtain a written waiver of any actual or potential conflict of interest between these two representations. Mr. Fair referred Ms. R to his brother, a CPA, to prepare a valuation of her husband's business for use in the dissolution matter. Mr. Fair did not explain or obtain a written waiver of any potential or actual conflicts of interest in referring the client to his brother. In July 2001, Mr. Fair prepared, and the court signed, the final dissolution pleadings. The pleadings awarded Ms. R the two real estate parcels. Mr. Fair did not conduct a title search prior to finalizing the pleadings. The contract payments and property taxes were delinquent on both parcels, and the legal descriptions of these lots contained errors. Additionally, Mr. Fair used four-year-old financial and employment information to determine his client's child support. In September 2001, Mr. Fair received $13,600 from the opposing client, for attorney's fees, and current and back-due child support. In October 2001, Mr. Fair wrote the client about this payment, but did not specify the amount received or the amounts he disbursed to his firm and to his brother. In October 2001, Lawyer A filed notices of intent to forfeit the two real estate parcels. Mr. Fair reviewed these documents. Mr. Fair obtained Mr. R's signature on deeds quitclaiming his interest to Ms. R. The auditor rejected the quitclaim deeds because of back-due taxes and errors in the excise-tax affidavits. In January 2002, Mr. Fair, after being promoted to partner, withdrew from representing Ms. R, because his partner was ""pursuing a foreclosure sale upon realty owned by you."" The client was evicted from her mobile home.Matter 2: Mr. Fair represented Ms. B in a marriage-dissolution action. The May 2002 decree required her former husband (H) to pay attorney's fees by April 10, 2003. The court's order provided that attorney's fees unpaid by May 2, 2003 would become a judgment and accrue interest. On appeal, Ms. B was awarded an additional $4,000, to be paid by November 22, 2002.On September 11, 2002, Mr. Fair garnished H's bank account. Mr. Fair's affidavit did not explain that H could make these payments until November 2002 and May 2003. H retained counsel, who scheduled a hearing on the garnishment for November 15. H's counsel agreed to continue the hearing date at Mr. Fair's request. Counsel sent a letter to the court continuing the hearing, but the letter did not arrive until after the hearing on September 15. Mr. Fair attended the hearing and did not tell the court of his agreement to continue the hearing. Mr. Fair argued the motions on the merits, and the court denied H's motion and awarded Mr. Fair additional attorney's fees. The matter was settled after opposing counsel filed a motion for reconsideration. Mr. Fair's conduct violated RPCs 1.7(a) and 1.10, by two lawyers associated in the same firm representing clients whose interests are directly adverse, unless the clients consent in writing after full disclosure; 1.7(b), by representing a client if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to a third person; 1.14, by failing to promptly deliver client funds upon request; 1.4(a), by failing to keep the client reasonably informed about the fees and costs disbursed from client funds; 1.4(b), by failing to explain to the extent necessary that Mr. Fair was holding child-support payments and that the client could challenge his removal of back-due child support; 1.3, by failing to diligently represent Ms. R; 3.1 and 3.3(f), by wrongfully garnishing Mr. B's bank account and failing to inform the court that he agreed to continue the hearing date.Leslie Ching Allen represented the Bar Association.

559.html,29192,Carlos Valero,,Suspension,12/1/2003,,"Carlos Valero (WSBA No. 29192, admitted 1999), of Spokane, was suspended for six months, effective December 1, 2003, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court approving a stipulation. This discipline was based on his knowingly disobeying court orders in 2001.Matter 1: In July 2000, Mr. Valero filed an adversary proceeding in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Mr. Valero named three defendants without any factual basis. The court dismissed the adversary proceeding, deeming the plaintiffs ""vexatious litigants,"" and imposed sanctions and conditions on filing pleadings in any U.S. court. The order imposed sanctions totaling $32,500 against the plaintiffs and Mr. Valero, jointly and severally. Mr. Valero did not pay these sanctions. The order also provided that any other U.S. court could refuse to accept pleadings relating to this subject matter, unless certain conditions were satisfied. Mr. Valero filed pleadings in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals relating to the earlier subject matter, without complying with the conditions in the bankruptcy court's order. In June 2001, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals required Mr. Valero to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed for his failure to comply with that court's rules and orders. Mr. Valero did not promptly respond, and the court imposed sanctions. Mr. Valero paid these sanctions.Matter 2: In March 1999, a bankruptcy judge awarded a partnership a judgment in an adversary proceeding. In late 1999 or early 2000, the partnership retained Mr. Valero. After several hearings, motions, and a premature appeal, the court entered a final order in favor of Mr. Valero's client in this matter on May 11, 2000. The defendants paid the judgment, and the payment was accepted and negotiated. Mr. Valero declined to file a satisfaction of judgment, despite repeated requests. His client refused to accept that the judgment had been satisfied. In October 2001, the court found that the judgment was satisfied and imposed sanctions of $2,909 jointly and severally against Mr. Valero and his clients. Mr. Valero did not pay these sanctions. Mr. Valero did not cooperate with the disciplinary investigation of this matter.Mr. Valero's conduct violated RPCs 3.4(c), by his knowingly disobeying court orders and failing to pay court-imposed sanctions; 8.4(d), by his engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; 8.4(i), by his committing an act reflecting disregard for the rule of law; and 8.4(l), by his failing to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation.G.

56.html,16416,John Radder,,Suspension,10/28/1997,,"Edmonds lawyer John L. Radder (WSBA No. 16416, admitted 1986) has been ordered suspended for 90 days, pursuant to a stipulation to discipline, approved by the Supreme Court October 28, 1997. The discipline is based on altering billing statements by switching initials, dates, or amounts of time worked on a clientâ€™s matter and on failing to take prompt corrective action when he learned of initial switching by his partner, lawyer Wade Dann.In September 1989, a construction company hired Radderâ€™s then-partner, Wade Dann, to present a claim regarding a highway construction project. Various firm personnel worked on the clientâ€™s matter, including Radder and a nonlawyer construction claims analyst. In February 1992, the client told the firm it no longer wanted the particular construction claims analyst working on its matter. During the following five months, the firm nevertheless had that claims analyst working on the clientâ€™s matter. Radder and Dann altered the firmâ€™s billing records by substituting Radderâ€™s initials for those of the claims analyst to conceal the fact that the claims analyst was still working on the matter.At that time, the firm billed Radderâ€™s time at $140 per hour and the claims analystâ€™s at $93 per hour. Substitution of Radderâ€™s initials for the claims analystâ€™s in the billings resulted in the clientâ€™s being overbilled approximately $2,500. But the firm wrote off more than that amount during the same period.In June 1992, Radder wrote the client a letter in which he stated ""[a]lso at your direction, we did not utilize [the claims analyst] to continue and finalize the presentation materials."" Radder knew that statement was untrue. The client found out the statement was untrue in about February 1993 when the Associationâ€™s investigation began. The client continued to employ Radder and the firm after February 1993. Radder became aware of other initial-switching by Dann. In mid-July 1992, Radder conducted an impromptu partnership meeting not attended by Dann at which Radder and the only other partner voted to stop the practice of initial switching on client bills.By switching or assisting in switching initials on client billings and writing the untruthful letter to the client, Radder violated RPC 8.4(c) and RLD 1.1(a), which prohibit dishonesty. By not taking corrective action regarding Dannâ€™s conduct, Radder violated RPC 5.1(c)(2), which requires a partner to take reasonable remedial action when he knows of a partnerâ€™s misconduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated.David Cluxton, Lisa Crawford, and Joy McLean represented the Bar Association.

Cohen (WSBA No. 373, admitted 1965), of Seattle, was suspended for one year, effective January 15, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. For further information, please see In re Discipline of Cohen, 150 Wn.2d 774, 82 P.3d 224 (2004). This discipline was based on his lack of diligence, communication, and improper withdrawal in a litigation matter from 1996 through 2000.In May 1996, Mr. Cohen agreed to represent a client in an employment dispute. Mr. Cohen obtained a continuance of the trial date without the client's knowledge, despite the client's request for a quick resolution. In July 1998, when opposing counsel hesitated to agree to a second continuance request, Mr. Cohen agreed to voluntarily dismiss the client's suit. Mr. Cohen told his client the employer had requested the second continuance. In September 1998, Mr. Cohen refiled the client's lawsuit. In April 1999, after Mr. Cohen had failed to file required pleadings and attend a status conference, the court dismissed the client's suit and imposed sanctions. In June 1999, Mr. Cohen paid the sanctions, and the court reinstated the client's case. In November, Mr. Cohen agreed, without his client's authority, to transfer the case to mandatory arbitration. At the arbitration hearing, Mr. Cohen called two witnesses and asked for $1.00 in damages. The arbitrator ruled against the client, and Mr. Cohen filed a trial de novo request, but failed to file a jury demand. In November 2000, after the employer filed a summary judgment motion, Mr. Cohen filed a motion to withdraw. Mr. Cohen based his motion on a letter from his physician detailing health conditions he had suffered for over a year. Mr. Cohen did not notify his client prior to filing this motion. The client was not able to obtain new counsel, and agreed to a dismissal with prejudice. Mr. Cohen's conduct violated RPCs 1.3 and 3.2, requiring lawyers to diligently represent clients and expedite litigation; 1.4(a), requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed of the status of their matters; 1.4(b), requiring lawyers to explain matters to the extent necessary for clients to make informed decisions; and 1.15, requiring lawyers to take reasonable steps to protect clients' interests upon withdrawal.

The discipline is based upon her telephone harassment of a bank employee in 2000.On October 7, 2000, Ms. M, a bank employee, received a voicemail message from Ms. Turk about bank statements. The voice mail stated: ""I want you to please let [J] know that Iâ€™d like to receive those statements by the end of the week at the latest. If I donâ€™t I will make a trip out there with a gun to shoot either you or [J] right between the eyes and I mean it. Iâ€™ll blow your head off. I want my statements. Goodbye."" The hearing officer found that Ms. Turk made the statement with the intent to harass, intimidate, torment or embarrass Ms. M. The police found a gun in Ms. Turkâ€™s residence. Ms. M obtained a restraining order against Ms. Turk and the bank hired guards to protect the two employees. On February 12, 2001, Ms. Turk pled guilty and was convicted on one count of telephone harassment under RCW 9.61.230(3)(b), a class-C felony.Ms. Turkâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting lawyers from committing criminal acts that reflect adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and RLD 1.1(a), prohibiting lawyers from committing acts reflecting a disregard for the rule of law.Anne I.

570.html,26591,Bobby Wheeler,,Reprimand,5/1/2002,,"Bobby O. Wheeler (WSBA No. 26591, admitted 1996), of Seattle, received a reprimand on September 13, 2002, based on a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board in May 2002.  This discipline is based on the filing of an action without basis of law, failure to adequately communicate with a client regarding the action, and failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing the client from 1998 to 2001.In 1998, Mr. K hired Mr. Wheeler to represent him in a proceeding to modify a California divorce and custody decree.  Mr. K hired Mr. Wheeler because he is admitted to practice in both Washington, where Mr. K resides, and in California, where Ms. K resides.  Mr. K received custody of their teenage daughter, and Ms. K agreed to pay child support and a percentage of unreimbursed medical expenses.  In 1999, Mr. K rehired Mr. Wheeler to enforce the settlement and to seek an increase in child support payments.  Mr. K alleged that Ms. K was not paying her share of medical expenses and that a higher child support payment was warranted.  Mr. K asked Mr. Wheeler about the possibility of filing for post-majority support for his daughter after she turned eighteen.  Mr. Wheeler advised Mr. K that he could seek post-majority support by filing a modification action in Washington.  An attorney assisting Mr. Wheeler concluded that California courts had exclusive jurisdiction, but a Washington court could obtain jurisdiction if all parties.  However, California does not recognize post-secondary support.  In late 1999, Mr. Wheeler filed motions in Santa Ana County Superior Court and King County Superior Court seeking modification of the California decree.  On or about mid-February 2000, Ms. Kâ€™s attorney, Mr. E,  advised Mr. Wheeler that California had exclusive jurisdiction.  The parties agreed to continue the Washington action at a later date.  On June 30, 2000, Mr. Wheeler moved to reset the Washington action for trial and to shorten the time for trial.  Mr. E again raised objections based on the lack of jurisdiction.  On July 19, 2000, Mr. E filed an ex-parte motion in Santa Clara Superior Court to temporarily enjoin the Washington action, and for attorneyâ€™s fees and sanctions incurred to defend the action.  The court set the motion for September 7, 2000.  On July 21, 2000, the King County Superior Court notified the parties that a hearing would be held in the Washington action on September 1, 2000.On August 2, 2000, the Santa Clara Superior Court held a hearing on the underlying child support issues.  The court ordered the parties to provide documentation regarding the disputed medical reimbursements within fifteen days of the hearing.  Mr. Wheeler did not file the documentation.  During the August 2, 2000 hearing, Mr. E moved to advance the hearing date on his motion to enjoin the Washington action.  The court informed Mr. E that he needed to file an ex-parte motion to shorten time, which he did on August 4, 2000.  Mr. Wheeler received a copy of the document.  Mr. E mailed a package of documents to Mr. Wheeler on August 11, 2000, via U.S. mail that identified the date of the hearing as August 23.  Mr. Wheeler asserts he never received the package.  Sometime between August 4 and August 17, 2000, Mr. Wheeler received a call from the Santa Clara Superior Court regarding the K. matter.  Mr. Wheeler asserts that he tried to call the court back but that he always received a busy signal.  On August 17, 2000, Mr. Wheeler sent a letter to Mr. E stating that he would dismiss the Washington action if Mr. E would withdraw the motion for injunctive relief and for sanctions.  On the same date, Mr. Wheeler left for California on another matter.  On August 18, 2000, Mr. E served Mr. Wheeler at his Seattle office with a letter stating that Mr. Wheelerâ€™s offer had come too late, and with a memorandum in support of his motion to enjoin the Washington action and for attorneyâ€™s fees.  These documents were received by Mr. Wheelerâ€™s secretary who forwarded a copy to Mr. K.  On receipt of the documents, Mr. K spoke to respondentâ€™s secretary asking when the hearing on the motion would be scheduled and whether Mr. Wheeler had made plans to attend.  Mr. Wheelerâ€™s secretary promised to relay his questions to Mr. Wheeler.  Mr. Wheeler did not provide an answer.  After leaving for California, Mr. Wheeler made no further inquiries to ascertain if Mr. Eâ€™s motion to shorten time had been granted, and if so, when the hearing would occur.  On August 23, 2000, the Santa Clara Superior Court held a hearing on Mr. Eâ€™s motion. Mr. Wheeler did not appear on Mr. Kâ€™s behalf.  The court assessed a sanction in the amount of $10,222 against Mr. K, representing the fees and costs expended by Ms. K to defend the Washington action.  On August 28, 2000, Mr. Wheeler dismissed the Washington action.  On September 11, 2000, Mr. Wheeler recommended filing a motion to set aside the California courtâ€™s August 23, 2000 order on Mr. Kâ€™s behalf.  Mr. Wheeler also told Mr. K that he would order the transcript of the hearing promptly.  Mr. Wheeler did not order the transcripts despite repeated reminders from Mr. K.  In December 2000, Mr. K ordered the transcripts himself.  On February 20, 2001, Mr. Wheeler filed a motion to set aside on behalf of Mr. K.  In mid-March 2001, Mr. K decided that he did not want to proceed with the motion to set aside because he was concerned that further sanctions would be assessed against him.  The motion was taken off the calendar, but Mr. E had already filed a response.  In April 2001, Mr. K expressed his frustrations to Mr. Wheeler about the course of representation and the sanctions that had been assessed against him.  By letter of April 16, 2001, Mr. Wheeler agreed to pay Mr. K $7,500 towards the sanctions assessed on August 23, 2000 and to make payment within 14-30 days.  He also agreed to incur liability for any attorneyâ€™s fees and costs that could arise from the filing of the motion to set aside.  Mr. Wheeler did not make the promised payment within 14-30 days.  He later paid Mr. K $3,700 towards the sanctions assessed on August 23, 2000.  In April 2001, Mr. K hired a new California lawyer who represented him at a hearing on September 19, 2001 in Santa Clara Superior Court to determine whether additional attorneyâ€™s fees should be awarded to Ms. K for having to respond to the motion to set aside.  At this hearing, the court awarded sanctions against Mr. Wheeler in the amount of $8,061.  Mr. Wheelerâ€™s conduct violated RPC 3.1, stating a lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; and, RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client.Kevin Bank represented the Bar Association.

This discipline was based on his failure to protect a client's rights upon withdrawal in a litigation matter.In Guam, Mr. Habib represented a client for approximately eight years. Five days prior to trial, Mr. Habib told the client that the judge in the case was hostile toward Mr. Habib and suggested that the client meet with lawyer G in an attempt to find new counsel. Mr. Habib sent the client's file to lawyer G and arranged two meetings. The client was not able to attend either meeting. Mr. Habib did not seek the court's permission to withdraw and did not appear for the client's trial. Lawyer G appeared at the trial, told the court he would not take the client's case, and returned her file. The judge continued the case for one week. The client appeared pro se, and the court entered a $76,570 judgment against her.

Toner (WSBA No. 19521, admitted 1990), of Beaverton, OR, was suspended for 30 days by order of the Washington State Supreme Court imposing reciprocal discipline based on an order from the state of Oregon. The Washington order, entered November 18, 2003, imposed a retroactive suspension in Washington based on the dates in the Oregon order.  (The effective date of the suspension was June 3, 1994.) This discipline was based on her assisting with the unauthorized practice of law in 1992.In August 1992, Ms. Toner entered a retainer agreement with A, a corporation engaged in the nonlawyer sale of revocable living trusts to the public. Ms. Toner rented office space from A and accepted client referrals and fees from A. She agreed to use only forms drafted and supplied by A. The agreement increased the fees due Ms. Toner as the total number of living trusts sold increased. In December 1993, the court issued an injunction against A, enjoining it from engaging in the practice of law. Ms. Toner did not disclose the conflicts of interest to the living-trust clients. Ms. Toner's conduct violated DR 3-101(A), by assisting in the unauthorized practice of law; DRs 5-101(A) and 5-105(E), by failing to disclose conflicts of interest to the living trust clients; and 5-108(A), by accepting compensation from a person other than the client, without full disclosure.Felice Congalton represented the Bar Association.

578.html,13243,Jeffrey Danzig,,Disbarment,11/25/2003,,"Jeffrey L. Danzig (WSBA No. 13243, admitted 1983), of Bellingham, was disbarred effective November 25, 2003, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 1998 and 2001 involving theft of client funds and conflict of interest in a medical-malpractice matter. In October 1998, Mr. Danzig agreed to represent clients in a medical-malpractice matter. The clients signed a written fee agreement for a $5,000 nonrefundable retainer and a contingency fee. Between October 1998 and November 2000, the clients paid Mr. Danzig $49,436.15 for costs, and an additional $2,700 in costs directly to third parties. Mr. Danzig deposited many of these payments into his personal checking account. By summer 2000, the clients could not afford to pay costs, so Mr. Danzig agreed to find a lawyer who could advance costs. He also prepared a new agreement stating that the clients agreed to pay fees in addition to those in the original fee agreement, and that they had no disagreement with ""regard to money or preparation of our case."" The clients initially refused to sign the new agreement, but did so after Mr. Danzig threatened to withdraw and make it difficult for the clients to find new counsel. Mr. Danzig did not tell the clients that they should obtain independent legal advice prior to signing the new fee agreement. In November 2000, Mr. Danzig associated with another lawyer, who agreed to advance costs to the clients prospectively. The new agreement also provided that Mr. Danzig and the new lawyer would receive a 50 percent contingency fee. In January 2001, the clients' case settled for $600,000. After signing the settlement check, the clients asked Mr. Danzig to provide an accounting. He told them he did not have receipts, could not provide an accounting, and would not refund any money. The hearing officer found that the clients were entitled to a $35,603.76 refund of unused and unaccounted for advanced costs. Mr. Danzig did not refund any money to the clients. Mr. Danzig's conduct violated RPCs 1.14(b)(3), 1.4, and 1.5(c), requiring lawyers to maintain complete records of client funds in their possession, and to render appropriate accountings to their clients; 1.4(b)(4) and 1.15(d), requiring lawyers to promptly refund unused advanced costs; 8.4(b), prohibiting lawyers from committing criminal acts [theft of client funds] that reflect adversely on the lawyers' honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as lawyers in other respects; and 1.8(a) and 1.4, requiring lawyers entering business transactions with clients to provide full disclosure and a reasonable opportunity for the clients to seek independent legal advice.

This discipline is based upon his failing to supervise nonlawyer assistants, to safeguard and maintain records of client funds, and sharing legal fees with a nonlawyer from 1996 to 1998.On March 12, 1996, Mr. Hubert and Ms. K signed an independent contractor agreement. Ms. Kâ€™s company, Washington Paralegal Services, Inc. (WPSI), would act as a non-real estate closing agent, and Mr. Hubert would provide services to WPSIâ€™s clients. WPSI would obtain the client, make a preliminary determination of client needs, and draft the appropriate paperwork. Mr. Hubert then reviewed the work and gave approval or made recommendations for changes. Mr. Hubert would appear in court, if necessary, except for real estate transactions, and be paid a small fee for each matter reviewed as per the agreement.Mr. Hubert established a trust account for WPSI to hold funds in escrow during real estate closings and granted Ms. K signatory rights. Mr. Hubert allowed WPSI to perform the accounting for the trust account, reconciling it each month. Mr. Hubert did not supervise this accounting.In April 1997, without Mr. Hubertâ€™s knowledge, Ms. K signed a wire-transfer services agreement with Seafirst, authorizing her, not Mr. Hubert, to request and verify wire transfers on the trust account.Between September 1997 and September 1998, Ms. K embezzled in excess of $275,000 from the trust account through wire transfers to other banks. On September 11, 1998, Mr. Hubert learned of the possible embezzlement through an anonymous letter, and by September 16, 1998 Mr. Hubert had determined that WPSI had embezzled money from the trust account. He immediately removed Ms. K from the account.On September 25, 1998, Mr. Hubert wrote to all affected clients and informed them of the situation. Mr. Hubert provided his insurance company and policy number to the clients, along with the name of the FBI agent in charge. Mr. Hubertâ€™s insurance covered all claims.Mr. Hubertâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 5.3, requiring lawyers to supervise nonlawyer assistants; 1.14, requiring lawyers to safeguard client funds, maintain complete records of funds, and promptly deliver funds they are entitled to receive to clients; and 5.4(a), prohibiting lawyers from sharing legal fees with nonlawyers.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

This discipline is based on his conduct in 1999, involving failing to diligently represent a client, failing to comply with the trust account regulations, and charging an unreasonable fee.In 1999, Mr. Ryan agreed to represent a client in vacating a guilty plea. The client was incarcerated, and Mr. Ryan agreed to help him purchase a used car. The client paid Mr. Ryan $50 for picking up the car. Mr. Ryan, with the client's permission, withdrew $2,050 from the client's jail account. Mr. Ryan did not deposit the client's money in his trust account or maintain any records of the funds. Between March 9 and March 27, 1999, Mr. Ryan made five appointments to pick up the car. He failed to appear for any of these appointments. The seller cancelled the deal and retained $100 of the client's funds to cover collect calls. By December 10, 1999, Mr. Ryan returned all of the client's funds. The client also paid Mr. Ryan $110 to transcribe two tapes. Mr. Ryan did not complete the transcriptions, and retained the client's funds.

This discipline is based on his conduct between 1999 and 2001, involving neglect of a client matter and failure to protect the clients' interests upon withdrawal. In August 1999, Mr. Passannante agreed to represent two clients in a claim for personal injuries they had sustained in a bar fight. Mr. Passannante deposited the client funds in an IOLTA account in Washington, while his office was in Oregon. In March 2000, Mr. Passannante learned that the bar's insurer denied the clients' claims.

Brandt (WSBA No. 23058, admitted 1993), of Kirkland, received a reprimand effective February 17, 2004, following a stipulation approved by the hearing officer. This discipline is based on Mr. Brandt's failure to provide diligent representation and follow the client's instructions in a personal-injury matter between 1998 and 2001.In September 1998, Mr. Brandt agreed to represent a client injured in an automobile accident. Shortly after agreeing to a contingent fee, Mr. Brandt learned that the client had pre-existing injuries. Although Mr. Brandt was concerned that the pre-existing injuries would affect the client's case, he did not communicate this concern to her. Mr. Brandt did not answer the client's phone calls or work on her case until February 2000, when he met with the client and reviewed a settlement demand letter. Mr. Brandt did not send the settlement letter or make any other attempts to communicate with the other driver's insurance company. In early 2001, in response to the client's statute of limitations concerns, Mr. Brandt drafted a complaint. Mr. Brandt did not file the complaint prior to expiration of the statute of limitations. In May 2002, the client fired Mr. Brandt and requested that he return her file. Mr. Brandt did not return the client's file.

This discipline is based on Mr. Wallâ€™s practicing law while on inactive status.On July 15, 1996, the Spokane County Prosecuting Attorneyâ€™s Office hired Mr. Wall as a deputy prosecuting attorney. During the first or second week of July, Mr. Wall contacted the Washington State Bar Association (WSBA) requesting a change in his status from inactive to active because of his position with the Spokane Prosecutorâ€™s Office. The WSBA received Mr. Wallâ€™s status change application and check on July 25, 1996. The next day, the WSBA wrote Mr. Wall that his status could not be changed until he completed the required continuing legal education (CLE) credits. Mr. Wall did not inform his employer that he was on inactive status. He began handling criminal prosecutions after the first week of August.During the month of August, Mr. Wall and the WSBA discussed his CLE credits and inactive status by letter and telephone. In late August, Mr. Wall asked that the MCLE Board waive his deficient CLE credits. Through an error, this matter was not placed on the September 1996 MCLE Board agenda. In December 1996, Mr. Wall received his annual licensing form from the WSBA, showing that his status was still inactive. In January 1997, Mr. Wall contacted the WSBA licensing department again, asking why he remained on inactive status. On January 14, 1997, Mr. Wall informed his supervisor that he was on inactive status and could not continue to practice until his CLE credits were completed and his status could be changed.

Cobos (WSBA No. 27006, admitted 1997), of Seattle, was disbarred effective January 12, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2002 involving multiple acts of misconduct in two client matters during 2002. Matter 1: In January 2002, Mr. Cobos agreed to represent a corporation in two pending lawsuits. Mr. Cobos did not deposit the client's payment into his trust account, bill the client, or provide an accounting for these funds. On May 23, 2002, the court issued an order compelling discovery and imposing $500 in attorney's fees on Mr. Cobos's client. Mr. Cobos did not notify his client of this order, provide the discovery, or pay the fees. In June 2002, the opposing party filed a summary judgment motion. Mr. Cobos did not tell his client about this motion, but the client's corporate counsel learned of the motion from the court file. On June 23, 2002, Mr. Cobos notified his client that the summary judgment motion had been continued and that he had completed the responsive pleadings. Mr. Cobos had not actually prepared responsive pleadings and did not contact his client after this date. Mr. Cobos did not inform his client or the court of his withdrawal from this case. In early July, the opposing party filed a motion for contempt against Mr. Cobos's client. Mr. Cobos did not tell opposing counsel that he no longer represented the company, or forward the pleadings to the corporation. At the end of July 2002, Mr. Cobos vacated his office, and, by August, his office phone number was disconnected. Mr. Cobos did not return the client file to the client or produce the file in response to the Bar Association's subpoena. Matter 2: In March 2002, Mr. Cobos agreed to represent the wife in a marriage-dissolution action. In April 2002, Mr. Cobos submitted pleadings indicating that the husband had stocks, bonds, and a pension. The client told Mr. Cobos that the husband did not have these assets. The wife initially asked that the husband contribute to her tuition costs. Later, the wife received a tuition grant, and asked Mr. Cobos to withdraw the request for contribution. Mr. Cobos told the client to keep quiet about the grant and pocket the money from her husband. Mr. Cobos continued to ask for this tuition contribution against the client's expressed wishes. On two occasions, while discussing payment of attorney's fees, Mr. Cobos asked the client to assist him in obtaining a false Mexican birth certificate and passport. In May 2002, the husband's lawyer filed a motion to revise the temporary order, including attorney's fees and sanctions against Mr. Cobos. Prior to the date of this hearing, the client told Mr. Cobos that she and her husband were discussing reconciliation. Mr. Cobos advised the client several times not to reconcile with her husband until after the hearing, so the court could award attorney's fees to Mr. Cobos. Mr. Cobos made several verbal attempts to become intimate with the client during the representation. The client terminated the representation prior to the hearing. The parties filed a joint motion dismissing the dissolution petition. Mr. Cobos threatened to sue the husband for filing the grievance in this matter. Mr. Cobos's conduct violated RPCs 1.2, requiring lawyers to abide by a client's decisions regarding the objectives of the representation; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients informed about the status of their matters; 1.7(b), prohibiting lawyers from representing a client if the representation might be materially limited by the lawyer's own interests, unless the client consents in writing after a full disclosure; 1.8(k), prohibiting a lawyer from having sexual relations with a current client, unless the sexual relationship existed between them at the time the lawyer-client relationship commenced; 1.14(a) and (b), requiring lawyers to deposit client funds in a trust account, maintain records of client funds, and provide accountings of those funds; 1.15(d), requiring lawyers to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect clients' interests upon withdrawal; 3.3(a), prohibiting lawyers from making false statements of material fact or law to the tribunal; 8.4(b), prohibiting committing criminal acts (attempt to violate Title 18 U.S.C.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 2001, involving willful disobedience of court orders and other acts of misconduct in litigation matters. Matter 1: Mr. Duncan represented the plaintiff in a King County Superior Court lawsuit. Although Mr. Duncan knew that the case was assigned to Kent, he designated his pleadings as Seattle Assignment Area. The defendant filed a motion to move the case to Kent, and served the motion on Mr. Duncan by certified mail to his rented postal box. In November 2000, the postal-box operator signed the certified-mail receipt for the motion. In December, Mr. Duncan told opposing counsel that he had not received the motion and that he did not accept certified mail. In March 2001, Mr. Duncan told the judge that someone would be available at the post office box facility to accept personally delivered documents; however, he instructed the facility personnel not to accept or sign for any documents. Mr. Duncan sent responsive letters to the assigned judge, but did not file any pleadings. Mr. Duncan also failed to provide signed complete answers to interrogatories, even after a court order. In June 2001, the court awarded sanctions against Mr. Duncan, which he failed to pay. Matter 2: In June 2001, Mr. Duncan filed a petition for a show cause order in a records disclosure matter. In July 2001, the defendant stated in a declaration that the records did not exist. About a week later, Mr. Duncan filed a second petition for a show cause order requiring disclosure of the same records. Mr. Duncan sent a fax directly to a represented party, knowing that opposing counsel was out of town during this time. Matter 3: In June 2001, Mr. Duncan filed, but did not serve on opposing counsel, a notice of motion to change the assigned judge in a litigation matter. Mr. Duncan failed to serve four other required documents on opposing counsel. Mr. Duncan presented and obtained an ex parte order changing the assigned judge at a time he knew that opposing counsel was out of town, and failed to serve the order on opposing counsel. After receiving the order changing the assigned judge, Mr. Duncan intentionally presented an ex parte order to a commissioner pro tem. Mr. Duncan also intentionally misstated the date of service in his declaration filed with the court. Matter 4: On July 24, 2001, Mr. Duncan faxed opposing counsel a notice and motion to extend time. The notice stated that the motion would be heard on July 13, 2001. The motion also stated that a judge other than the judge assigned to the case would hear the matter. Opposing counsel did not respond to the motion, because it was set for a date that had already passed. Mr. Duncan altered his motion, indicating it was to be heard July 26, 2001, and by the judge assigned to the case. He then presented the motion and obtained an order extending time for his response without allowing opposing counsel to respond. In September 2001, the judge ordered $500 in sanctions against Mr. Duncan. Mr. Duncan willfully failed to pay the sanctions. In March 2002, the judge held Mr. Duncan in contempt of court and ordered that he forfeit $50 per day for each day the sanctions remain unpaid. The court also imposed an additional $500 in attorney's fees. Mr. Duncan's conduct violated RPCs 3.1, prohibiting lawyers from bringing or defending a proceeding, or asserting or controverting an issue, unless there is a nonfrivolous basis for doing so; 3.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly disobeying an obligation under the rules of a tribunal; 3.4(d), requiring lawyers to make diligent efforts to comply with legally proper discovery requests by an opposing party; 4.2, prohibiting lawyers from communicating about the subject matter of the representation with represented parties without consent of the other lawyer or legal authorization; 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or misrepresentation; 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; and 8.4(j), prohibiting willful disobedience or violation of a court order directed to the lawyer.Randy Beitel represented the Bar Association.

Earl (WSBA No. 10902, admitted 1980), of Moses Lake was disbarred effective May 13, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing.  This discipline was based on his conduct from 1992 through 1998, involving charging fees while representing clients as court appointed criminal defense counsel, failing to explain the choice between appointed counsel and retained counsel, charging unreasonable fees and voluntarily  maintaining an excessive caseload while one of the lawyers under contract to provide indigent criminal defense in Grant County.  	Matter 1: In 1996, Mr. Earl was appointed to defend a client in two criminal matters.  In September and October 1997, Mr. Earl was appointed to represent the same client in a sentencing violation and two new felony charges. Mr. Earl filed notices of appearance in the new cases, but not in the sentencing violation matter. The clientâ€™s Determination of Indigency form was filed, but not signed by the court.  Although Mr. Earl testified that he was not appointed to represent this client, the hearing officer found that he was appointed counsel.  Mr. Earl charged the client $3,000 for this representation.  Matter 2: In June 1998, the court appointed Mr. Earl to represent a client on a criminal felony charge.  The client wanted to retain a particular lawyer.  The client only partially completed the indigency report and the court found him not indigent.  Mr. Earl did not fully explain the clientâ€™s rights to seek appointed counsel and made no effort to complete the indigency report or argue that the client was actually indigent.  Mr. Earl contacted the client on the day of the hearing and suggested that the client retain him.  The client agreed to pay Mr. Earl $3,000, but could not meet the payment schedule.  Mr. Earl withheld services pending the clientâ€™s payments.  Matter 3: In September 1993, Grant County Superior Court issued an order appointing the indigent defenders to represent a defendant.  Following the usual procedure, the Court appointed the indigent defenders at the first hearing, prior to filing of the indigency report.   Five days later, Mr. Earl filed his notice of appearance and a document identifying himself as the clientâ€™s lawyer.  No determination of indigency report was ever filed in this case.  In October and again in November 1993, the clientâ€™s mother paid Mr. Earl $1,500 for the clientâ€™s representation.  Mr. Earl was obligated to provide this representation without charge to the client.  Matter 4: On December 18, 1992, the court appointed the â€œcontract defendersâ€ to represent a criminal defendant.  The defendant agreed to accept appointed counsel, but indicated he may attempt to retain counsel.  Mr. Earl appeared in court with the defendant that same day.  By June 1993, the client had paid Mr. Earl $2,220.00.  Mr. Earl did not provide his client a full and fair explanation regarding the decision to retain Mr. Earl, after the court entered an order appointing counsel.  Matter 5: In April 1998, Mr. Earl was appointed to represent a criminal defendant.  In May, the court found the client indigent, but able to contribute.  On August 5, 1998, a jury found the client guilty.   On August 10, 1998, prior to sentencing and without a determination of the clientâ€™s indigency status for appeal, Mr. Earl talked to the client about the cost of retaining him for the appeal. Mr. Earl agreed to do the clientâ€™s appeal for a flat fee of $5,000.00.  By accepting the clientâ€™s money during the appointed representation and prior to a determination of the clientâ€™s indigency for appeal, Mr. Earl may have created a conflict between his personal interests in keeping the clientâ€™s funds and the clientâ€™s interests in qualifying for appointed counsel.  The hearing officer found the $5,000 fee to be unreasonable based on the actual work Mr. Earl performed.  Matter 6: On August 1, 1994, Mr. Earl appeared in court as appointed counsel with an indigent criminal defendant.  The next day, Mr. Earl filed a notice of appearance.  The client believed he would receive better representation if he hired a lawyer rather than using appointed counsel.  By January 1995, the client paid Mr. Earl $2,700.00.  Mr. Earl did not initiate the discussion leading to the client retaining him, but he took advantage of the clientâ€™s belief that he would receive a better outcome if he retained Earl.  The hearing officer found that Mr. Earl was obligated to represent the client and should have refused the payment.  Matter 7: In April 1993, Mr. Earl was assigned counsel for a criminal defendant charged with child rape and child molestation.  The client and his family believed that Mr. Earl was not aggressively defending the client.  During an in-chambers meeting with the judge prior to trial, Mr. Earl stated, â€œhe [the client] believes my role is to find proof that heâ€™s innocent of this particular charge.  Iâ€™ve explained to him the role, or my role, is to see his constitutions rights are protected.â€  The hearing officer found that Mr. Earl fundamentally misunderstood his role as assigned counsel.  The hearing officer also found that Mr. Earlâ€™s voluntarily excessive caseload was prejudicial to the administration of justice. Matter 8: In July 1996, Mr. Earl appeared as appointed counsel for a criminal defendant on felony charges, including attempted murder. The client was acquitted by reason of insanity and committed to Eastern State Hospital.  Mr. Earlâ€™s appointed representation ended.  In August 2000, the client retained Mr. Earl to represent him in an attempt to modify his conditions of confinement and to explore revoking his guilty plea. The court docket reflects no work on the clientâ€™s case after August 2000.  In fall 2000, the client asked Mr. Earl to withdraw and refund the unused portion of his $2,500 in fees.  Mr. Earl did not withdraw or refund any of the fees.  A few weeks later, the client filed a grievance against Mr. Earl.  Mr. Earl told the client he would take no further action on his case while the grievance was pending.  In June 2001, new appointed counsel successfully withdrew the clientâ€™s insanity plea and entered a guilty plea to a reduced charge with no additional confinement. Mr. Earlâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.4(b), requiring lawyers to explain client matters to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make an informed decision regarding the representation; 1.5(a), requiring lawyers to charge reasonable fees; 1.7(b), prohibiting lawyers from representing a client if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyers own interests; 7.1, prohibiting lawyers from making false or misleading statements communications about the lawyer or the lawyerâ€™s services; 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging ion conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud or misrepresentation; 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; and 8.4(i), prohibiting lawyers from committing acts involving moral turpitude.Christine Gray and Linda B.

6.html,10925,Clark Ransom,,Disbarment,3/4/2002,,"Clark T. Ransom (WSBA No. 10925, admitted 1980), of Rainier, was disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective March 4, 2002, following a default hearing. The discipline is based on lack of diligence, unfair business transactions with a client, and failure to protect two clientsâ€™ interests when closing his practice in 1999.Matter 1: In early 1999, Mr. Ransom began representing Mr. O on several matters, including an ongoing bankruptcy. The client consulted Mr. Ransom for advice on how to realize his investment in a parcel of real property to obtain funds to pay off his creditors. The client needed financing to build a road though the property to provide access to 13 subdivided lots. Mr. Ransom suggested that his brother might be interested in investing in the clientâ€™s subdivision project.In March 1999, the client met with Mr. Ransom and his brother regarding a possible investment. The client learned that an undeveloped parcel of land in Poulso was available for sale. The client hired Mr. Ransom to work with him in this purchase along with Mr. H, who was to provide the financing. The client would log the land and sell the lumber, and together they would subdivide and sell the individual lots. In exchange for doing the necessary legal work on this project, Mr. Ransom agreed to accept 20 percent of the profits, and told the client he would create a corporation to handle the transaction. Mr. Ransom did not form a corporation, but did print letterhead with a corporate name, listing himself as president.In May 1999, Mr. Ransom wrote the client a letter on corporate letterhead offering to finance the $35,000 cost of road construction in exchange for being repaid out of the first available proceeds, and a fee of $2,000 for each of the 13 lots to be sold. The client accepted the offer, and another lawyer filed a motion asking the bankruptcy court to approve the plan.In June 1999, Mr. Ransom attempted to register the corporate name with the Washington secretary of state. Upon discovering that a corporation already existed under that name, he registered under a different name, listing himself as the sole director and registered agent. The bankruptcy court approved the loan from the first unregistered corporation.In August, Mr. Ransom obtained a $25,000 loan for the corporation from his brother. The corporation promised to pay the brother $30,000 before January 1, 2000. Mr. Ransom deposited the money into a bank account in the corporationâ€™s name. Over the first few weeks in September 1999, Mr. Ransom made several withdrawals from this account, including checks made out to himself, his video business and his son. Mr. Ransom did not pay the contractors who were logging the Poulsbo property and did not complete the services contract for the road.In mid-October 1999, Mr. Ransom told his brother that he was closing his law practice and moving to Arizona. Mr. Ransom was representing Mr. O when he left Washington, and failed to notify his client of this decision, and to answer disciplinary counselâ€™s questions about this matter.Matter 2: In April 1999, Mr. Ransom represented Mr. and Mrs. R in an appeal from a Department of Licensing (DOL) administrative law judgeâ€™s decision imposing a $19,710 tax and fee assessment against their trucking business. Mr. Ransom mailed the clientsâ€™ petition for reconsideration one day after the 10-day deadline.On May 7, 1999, the DOL director denied the clientsâ€™ petition because it was not timely filed. The directorâ€™s decision also explained the procedures for judicial review. Mr. Ransom filed the clientsâ€™ petition for judicial review more than 30 days after the deadline, and failed to serve the DOL and the attorney general for another three weeks. The clients were unable to contact Mr. Ransom, so they called the assistant attorney general working on the case. The clients learned that their petition was filed late and that the attorney general had filed a motion to dismiss their petition. The clients then learned that Mr. Ransom had left the state and that they could pick up their file from his 17-year-old son. The clients retained new counsel and negotiated a settlement with DOL. Mr. Ransom failed to respond to disciplinary counselâ€™s requests for information regarding this matter.Mr. Ransomâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters; 1.15(d), requiring lawyers to take steps to protect clientsâ€™ interests after terminating representation; 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; and RLD 2.8(a), requiring lawyers to promptly respond to disciplinary counselsâ€™ requests for information regarding disciplinary investigations.Kevin Bank represented the Bar Association.

Mitchell (WSBA No. 24718, admitted 1995), of Seattle, was disbarred effective March 25, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2002 involving theft of client funds. (Mr. Mitchell is to be distinguished from William Genther Mitchell of Lynden and William Patrick Mitchell of Seattle.)Mr. Mitchell represented a client in a claim for damages sustained in an automobile accident. Mr. Mitchell also agreed to represent the insurance company that had a subrogated interest in the client's claim. In March 2002, Mr. Mitchell settled the claim and deposited the funds into his trust account. Mr. Mitchell did not inform the insurance company of the settlement, and embezzled the company's funds. The insurance company learned of the settlement and made several requests that Mr. Mitchell forward the funds to them. Mr. Mitchell promised to send the funds, knowing he had already embezzled them. As of the date of the hearing, Mr. Mitchell had not paid the funds to the insurance company. Mr. Mitchell also failed to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation. Mr. Mitchell's conduct violated RPCs 8.4(b), prohibiting committing a criminal act [RCW 9A.56.030, Theft in the First Degree] that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; 8.4(i), prohibiting committing an act involving moral turpitude; 1.14(b)(1), requiring lawyers to promptly notify clients of deposit of client funds; 1.14(b)(4), requiring lawyers to promptly deliver client funds upon request; and 8.4(l) and ELC 5.3, requiring lawyers to promptly respond to requests for information during disciplinary investigations.

Fennell (WSBA No. 15274, admitted 1985), of Bellevue, was suspended for one year, effective May 11, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 1996 and 1998 involving marking up costs in nonjudicial foreclosure actions. Mr. Fennell supervised and conducted nonjudicial foreclosures for his firm's Washington and Oregon clients. Mr. Fennell, through his firm, contracted with outside vendors for posting of notices required in real property nonjudicial foreclosure actions. In February 1996, Mr. Fennell and the other firm partner incorporated Posters, Inc. (Posters). Posters contracted with other outside vendors to provide posting services to the law firm's foreclosure clients. The law firm employees coordinated the posting services before and during Posters' existence. Posters marked up the cost of the posting service between 50 and 100 percent ($10 to $20). The costs for the posting services, even after the 100 percent markup, were within the range of charges for these services in the geographical area. Firm employees created invoices with these marked-up costs and placed them in the client files, but did not send them to the clients. Mr. Fennell and his firm disclosed a financial interest in vendors to some, but not all, clients. In May 1998, the firm disclosed the cost markup for the first time. The disclosure stated ""Posters marks up the amount charged by its subcontractors to cover overhead allocated to Posters by the law firm, risk undertaken by Posters and profit."" The firm did not allocate overhead to Posters, although it intended to do so. Mr. Fennell's conduct violated RPCs 1.8(a), prohibiting knowingly obtaining a pecuniary interest adverse to the client, unless the transaction terms are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed in writing to the client and the client consents, after a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel; 1.5(b), requiring lawyers who have not regularly represented a client or if the fee agreement is substantially different from previous agreements, to communicate the basis of the fee and factors in its determination to the client, preferably in writing; and 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.John R.

This discipline was based on his failure to comply with the terms of a prior disciplinary order. (Mr. Wilson is to be distinguished from Gregory M. Wilson of Greenacres.)In May 2000, the Washington State Supreme Court approved Mr. Wilson's stipulation to a 30-day suspension. The stipulation required Mr. Wilson to obtain malpractice insurance, or provide written notification of rejection by three companies. Mr. Wilson was also required to make monthly payments to the client involved in that matter. In April 2003, the Washington State Supreme Court approved Mr. Wilson's stipulation to a three-month suspension for failing to comply with the conditions in the May 2000 order. Mr. Wilson returned to practice on July 1, 2003. Although he paid the required restitution, the payments were not timely and not paid pursuant to electronic transfer as ordered. Mr. Wilson did not provide written notification of rejection by three malpractice insurers by the date required.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 2000, involving acts of misconduct in bankruptcy and real property matters.Matter 1: In August 2000, a client paid Mr. Jorgensen $1,000 to file a lawsuit regarding delivery of a motor home. Between August 25 and October 18, 2000, Mr. Jorgensen failed to return the client's calls for information on the status of his lawsuit. On October 18, 2000, the client sent Mr. Jorgensen a letter requesting a full refund and return of all documents. Mr. Jorgensen did not respond to the client's letter.Matter 2: This matter includes eight client matters and an allegation that Mr. Jorgensen failed to comply with a prior disciplinary order. In seven matters, Mr. Jorgensen represented the clients in bankruptcy petitions. In five of these matters, Mr. Jorgensen accepted the clients' money, did no work, and failed to refund unearned fees or return the clients' files. Mr. Jorgensen did not notify these clients that he was withdrawing from the representation. In two other bankruptcy matters, Mr. Jorgensen filed incomplete bankruptcy petitions, which the court dismissed. In one client matter, Mr. Jorgensen agreed to assist a client in obtaining clear title to a real property she inherited. The client delivered the original will, death certificate, and property deed to Mr. Jorgensen. Mr. Jorgensen failed to do any work on the client's case. He did not return the client's original documents or unearned fees. A prior disciplinary order required Mr. Jorgensen to attend ethics school. Although the Probation Unit sent Mr. Jorgensen a letter reminding him of this obligation, he failed to provide proof of attendance. Mr. Jorgensen's conduct violated California Business and Professions Code Â§Â§ 6068(m), requiring lawyers to respond promptly to reasonable status inquiries from clients; 6068(i), requiring lawyers to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation; and 6103, requiring lawyers to comply with the terms of disciplinary orders; and California Rules of Professional Conduct 3-700(D)(1), requiring lawyers to promptly release, upon termination of representation, all client papers and property upon request; 3-700(D)(2), requiring lawyers to promptly return unearned advance-fee deposits; 3-700(A)(2), requiring lawyers to take reasonable steps to protect a client's interests upon withdrawal from the representation; and 3-110(a), prohibiting lawyers from intentionally, recklessly, or repeatedly failing to perform legal services with competence.Felice Congalton represented the Bar Association.

61.html,16927,C. Grider,,Disbarment,5/31/2001,,"C. Alan Grider (WSBA No. 16927, admitted 1987), of Clarkston, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective May 31, 2001, following a stipulation. The discipline is based his failing to preserve client funds and entering into an unfair business transaction with a client from 1998 through 2000.Matter 1: In October 1990, Mr. Grider established a trust for a client. The client was the grantor, and Mr. Grider and the client were named co-trustees. Mr. Grider also drafted a will for this client, naming himself as executor and trustee. The will contained a specific bequest to D.C., who was raised as the clientâ€™s daughter but was never legally adopted. At the time of the clientâ€™s death on May 11, 1995, the trust had $110,709.36 in assets. Mr. Grider sent monthly checks to D.C. beginning in June 1995.In February 1998, he wrote D.C. ""there should be sufficient income from the investments to keep these payments coming for many years. This I fully intend to do."" D.C. did not receive any funds after September 2000. It appears that there are no remaining funds and $88,500 is missing.Matter 2: In 1998, Mr. Grider agreed to represent a client whose husband had been killed in an automobile accident. Mr. Grider did not have a written fee agreement with the client. The court appointed the wife as personal representative of the husbandâ€™s estate and also appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) for the two children. On August 4, 1998, the insurance company issued two $77,827.59 checks, one for each child. The GAL endorsed the checks and Mr. Grider deposited them into his IOLTA trust account. On August 11, Mr. Grider withdrew $100,000 and purchased a three-month certificate of deposit in the name of ""C. Alan Grider ITF and [childâ€™s name]."" On August 13, Mr. Grider transferred $14,000 from the IOLTA account into his general account. Although his ledger indicates this transfer was for court-ordered fees, there were no withdrawals authorized at that time. In a declaration filed with the court, Mr. Grider stated that his fees were justified because both the insurance company and the husbandâ€™s employer initially denied coverage. In fact, neither company denied coverage.The court approved the children purchasing one half of a family home. The client found a suitable house, but Mr. Grider told her she could not buy it. Then, in January 1999, Mr. Grider sold her a remote, undeveloped five-acre parcel he owned with his wife and another couple. Mr. Grider sent the client to another lawyer to draft the documents. The GAL was not involved in this process and Mr. Grider specified all the terms.In July 1999, the client met with the GAL. The client explained that she could not afford to put a home on the property and that no electricity, water or roads currently served the area. The GAL contacted Mr. Grider and suggested that he refund the childrenâ€™s money. In August or September 1999, Mr. Grider withdrew from the case, and another lawyer substituted as counsel for the personal representative. Mr. Grider sent a check to substituted counsel for the balance of the estate funds. Due to a shortage of funds in the trust account, Mr. Grider used other clientsâ€™ funds to cover this check.Matter 3: Mr. Grider represented a minor in a personal-injury case. The child had been severely bitten by a dog. On December 16, 1998, the court approved a $14,272.66 settlement. The court ordered that the funds be placed in a blocked account and not released prior to the childâ€™s age of majority without a court order. Mr. Griderâ€™s client ledger indicates that the childâ€™s money is still owed, but it is not in an IOLTA trust account or blocked account.Matter 4: Mr. Griderâ€™s client ledger for an estate had a negative balance beginning April 30, 1999, and as of the stipulation date, December 20, 2000, that balance was negative $19,221.94. On June 19, 2000, Mr. Grider sent the beneficiary a statement indicating the estate balance was $43,069.05.Mr. Griderâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.14, requiring lawyers to preserve client funds; 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, misrepresentation or deceit; 1.8(a), prohibiting entering a business transaction with a client unless the terms are fair and reasonable and the client obtains independent legal advice; and 3.3(a), prohibiting misrepresentation of material facts to a tribunal.C.

This discipline is based on his failure to properly manage his trust account in 2001 and 2002.Matter 1: In August 2000, Mr. Poole represented a client in a contract dispute. In November 2000, Mr. Poole retained an expert, asking him to send his bill to Mr. Poole's office. In February 2001, Mr. Poole billed the client for attorney's fees and the $500 expert-witness fee. Mr. Poole deposited the client's March 2001 payment, including the expert-witness fee, into his general account. In July, Mr. Poole wrote to the client, asking her to pay the expert directly. The client responded that she had already sent the money to Mr. Poole and directed him to pay the expert's bill. Mr. Poole paid the expert bill with interest on December 19, 2001, after the expert filed a grievance with the Bar Association. Matter 2: In 2002, the Bar Association audited Mr. Poole's trust account. The audit found the following trust-account management issues: check registers without a running balance and failure to reconcile the check register to the client ledgers; incomplete and inaccurate client ledgers; earned fees retained in the trust account; disbursement of funds prior to deposits clearing the banking system; disbursement of funds prior to date of actual client deposit; and a shortage. The hearing officer found that Mr. Poole's conduct was negligent, not intentional. No clients actually lost funds, but this conduct caused potential injury. Mr. Poole's conduct violated RPCs 1.14(a), by failing to place client money for expert fees in the trust account; disbursing funds of one client on behalf of another; commingling the lawyer's own funds with client funds in the trust account; and failing to wait for deposited items to clear the banking system before disbursing from the trust account; 1.14(b)(4), by failing to promptly follow the client's instructions to pay the expert fee; and holding funds of inactive client in the trust account; and 1.14(b)(3), by failing to maintain complete trust-account records.Christine Gray and Randy Beitel represented the Bar Association.

Gelman (WSBA No. 20147, admitted 1990), of Tacoma, was disbarred, effective August 17, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2000 and 2003 involving multiple acts of misconduct affecting personal-injury clients, improper use and disbursement of client funds in his trust account, commission of a criminal act, and failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation.Between May 2001 and May 2003, Mr. Gelman engaged in the following conduct that established grounds for discipline:â€¢ Failing to initiate a personal-injury action for a client before the expiration of the statute of limitations, resulting in loss of the clientâ€™s claim.â€¢ In four instances, falsely informing clients that funds would be withheld from their settlement proceeds to pay PIP claims, medical bills, and subrogation claims.â€¢ In five instances, failing to maintain settlement proceeds â€” earmarked to pay PIP claims, medical bills, and subrogation claims â€” in a client trust account, and using the funds for personal and/or business purposes without the clientsâ€™ knowledge, consent, or authorization. â€¢ Responding untruthfully to a client inquiry about how the clientâ€™s settlement funds had been disbursed.â€¢ Directing his bookkeeper to make a false entry in his IOLTA account register in order to deal with a discrepancy in the account.â€¢ On seven occasions, illegally obtaining a controlled substance with an altered prescription, in violation of RCW 69.50.403(a)(3) and/or (5).â€¢ Failing to appear at two depositions as required by subpoenas issued by disciplinary counsel. â€¢ Failing to produce requested records during a Bar Association audit of his IOLTA account, rendering the auditor unable to complete the audit.At the time of his entry into the disciplinary stipulation, Mr. Gelman had paid or agreed to pay restitution to all of the affected clients.

615.html,7355,Gary Greenbaum,,Suspension,5/27/2004,,"Gary I. Greenbaum (WSBA No. 7355, admitted 1977), of Seattle, was suspended for two years, effective May 27, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2001 and 2002 involving practicing with a suspended license and violations in three client-litigation matters. Matter 1: In May 1995, Mr. Greenbaum agreed to represent a client in a personal injury claim arising out of an April 1995 automobile accident. When Mr. Greenbaum did not aggressively pursue the claim or contact the client, she retained new counsel. Mr. Greenbaum failed to sign a substitution of counsel pleading or forward the client's file to the new counsel. Mr. Greenbaum willfully violated the court's May 13, 2002, order that he turn over the client's file. In July 2002, the court imposed a judgment of $8,000 against Mr. Greenbaum and ordered additional sanctions for each day he failed to turn over the file. In September 2002, Mr. Greenbaum paid the sanctions.Matter 2: In August 1998, Mr. Greenbaum agreed to represent a client in a personal-injury claim arising out of an automobile accident. The client specifically requested that Mr. Greenbaum settle her case quickly. Mr. Greenbaum initially communicated with the client, but later became unresponsive. In July 2001, Mr. Greenbaum agreed to represent the client in a second personal-injury claim arising out of a second automobile accident. In July 2001, Mr. Greenbaum filed a complaint regarding the first accident, but took no further actions on the client's cases and failed to respond to her calls and letters.Matter 3: On or about July 1, 2002, Mr. Greenbaum notified some of his clients that he had associated another lawyer in their cases. On July 15, 2002, the Supreme Court suspended Mr. Greenbaum's license to practice law for failure to pay his Association membership dues. Mr. Greenbaum did not notify his clients of his suspension, as required by ELC 14.3 [formerly RLD 8.1(a)]. Mr. Greenbaum did not instruct the staff at his office to provide information regarding his suspension or stop announcing him as an attorney. Matter 4: In June 1999, Mr. Greenbaum agreed to represent a client in a personal-injury matter. In June 2001, without informing the client, Mr. Greenbaum filed a lawsuit. During 2002, the court issued orders compelling discovery, awarding attorney's fees against the client, and, finally, dismissing the lawsuit. Mr. Greenbaum did not respond to any of these motions or notify the client of the orders. In December 2002, a collection agency contacted the client about the attorney's fees awarded in the dismissal. Mr. Greenbaum offered to pay the attorney's fees, but did not do so. Mr. Greenbaum's conduct violated RPCs 1.2, requiring lawyers to abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation; 1.3 and 3.2, requiring lawyers to diligently represent clients and expedite litigation consistent with the clients' interests; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed of the status of their matters; 8.4(j), prohibiting willful disobedience of court orders; 1.15(a)(1), requiring lawyers to withdraw from representation if continuing will result in an RPC violation; 7.1(a), prohibiting lawyers from making false or misleading communications about their services; and 8.4(a), prohibiting attempting to violate the RPCs through others; and ELC 14.1(c) and 14.3, requiring lawyers to comply with the duties on suspension.Anthony Butler represented the Bar Association.

616.html,22730,Douglas Osterloh,,Disbarment,3/23/2005,,"Douglas D. Osterloh (WSBA No. 22730, admitted 1993), of Boring, OR, was disbarred, effective March 23, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2001 and 2004 involving misrepresentations to clients, lack of diligence, providing false testimony and fabricated documents during disciplinary investigations, and failure to cooperate with disciplinary investigations.Matter 1: In 2000, Client A hired Mr. Osterloh to represent her in applying to the INS for a green card. Respondent filed the pertinent documentation on Client A's behalf, but the INS denied Client A's petition in September 2003. Client A followed Mr. Osterloh's advice to reapply rather than appeal. Repeatedly, between January 2003 and November 2003, Mr. Osterloh told Client A that he had filed a new application in January when in fact he had not done so. Client A repeatedly requested a copy of the January 2003 filing; Mr. Osterloh promised to send one to her, and in one instance told her that he had mailed a copy, but he did not do so. The misrepresentations were knowing and intentional.During an ensuing disciplinary investigation, Mr. Osterloh failed to respond to requests for information, testified falsely during a disciplinary deposition, and provided disciplinary counsel with fabricated documents with the intent to deceive disciplinary counsel into believing that he had filed Client A's petition in January 2003.Matter 2: In September 2001, another lawyer hired Mr. Osterloh to file an appeal for Client B, whose application to work as a special immigrant religious worker had been denied by the INS. The lawyer paid Mr. Osterloh $1,500 for the representation. Mr. Osterloh never filed an appeal brief on behalf of Client B. In October 2001, the lawyer hired Mr. Osterloh to file an appeal for Client C, whose application to work as a special immigrant religious worker had also been denied by the INS. The lawyer paid Mr. Osterloh $750 to file the appeal. Mr. Osterloh never filed an appeal brief on behalf of Client C, and the appeal was dismissed for that reason in July 2002.Between October 2001 and October 2003, on numerous occasions, the lawyer asked Mr. Osterloh about the status of the appeals and asked for copies of the briefs. Mr. Osterloh falsely told the lawyer that the briefs had been filed and promised to send copies, but never did so.During an ensuing disciplinary investigation, Mr. Osterloh failed to respond to requests for information, failed to appear at a deposition as required by subpoena, provided false information, testified falsely at a deposition, failed to produce subpoenaed documents, and provided disciplinary counsel with fabricated documents with the intent to deceive disciplinary counsel into believing that he had filed Client B's and Client C's briefs.Ms. Osterloh's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting commission of a criminal act (here, perjury) that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct.Christine Gray represented the Bar Association.

Perry (WSBA No. 15623, admitted 1986), of San Francisco, CA, was suspended for 23 months and for 30 days, effective June 1, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court imposing reciprocal discipline based on two orders for similar discipline from the state of California. This discipline was based on his lack of diligence in a litigation matter between 1995 and 1997, and willful failure to comply with a court order in 2002.Matter 1: In July 1995, Mr. Perry agreed to represent a client in a claim against various security brokers. Mr. Perry filed the client's complaint and arbitration was scheduled for December 1996. Mr. Perry then notified the client that the arbitration had been continued, and indicated he would inform the client of the new date. Mr. Perry had no further contact with his client. The arbitration was continued twice due to Mr. Perry's failure to comply with discovery. In June 1997, opposing counsel scheduled a motion to dismiss based on Mr. Perry's repeated failure to comply with discovery deadlines. Mr. Perry did not notify his client of the discovery dispute or the arbitration date. Neither Mr. Perry nor his client appeared for the arbitration. The arbitrator dismissed the client's claims. The client learned of the dismissal during the disciplinary investigation. Matter 2: On April 5, 2002, the Supreme Court of California ordered Mr. Perry to comply with California Rule of Court 955, the rule regarding duties upon suspension. On May 1, 2002, the State Bar of California sent Mr. Perry a copy of the order, but it was returned ""moved, left no address."" The court ordered Mr. Perry to comply with the Rule by June 15, 2002. Mr. Perry did not comply until August 30, 2002. Mr. Perry's conduct violated California Rules of Professional Conduct 3-110(A), prohibiting lawyers from intentionally, recklessly, or repeatedly failing to perform legal services with competence; and 3-700(D)(2), requiring lawyers to promptly refund unearned advance fee payments; and California Business and Professions Code Â§Â§ 6068(m), requiring lawyers to promptly respond to client-status inquiries and keep clients reasonably informed of significant developments in their matters; 6103, prohibiting willful violation of court orders; and 6068(i), requiring lawyers to cooperate and participate in disciplinary investigations.

This discipline is based on her conduct in 2001, involving making a statement that could have been misleading in a public-defense matter.In January 2001, Ms. Reeves was assigned to represent a criminal defendant. In March 2001, the client entered guilty pleas to two charges. Ms. Reeves believed her client might have mental problems, and she wanted to obtain a mental evaluation for him. While the case was set for sentencing, an assistant prepared the necessary paperwork for appointment of the expert at public expense. Ms. Reeves signed the paperwork and wrote in that the case was set for trial. Ms. Reeves knew this statement was not true. The paperwork was forwarded to the administrator of the Office of the Public Defender. Prior to any decision, and for other reasons, the paperwork was withdrawn. At a later time, substitute counsel re-submitted the request with the correct status and the request was granted. Ms. Reeves' conduct violated RPCs 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.Leslie Ching Allen represented the Bar Association.

The Supreme Courtâ€™s order of reciprocal discipline, pursuant to Rule for Lawyer Discipline (RLD) 12.6, is based on the Supreme Court of the State of Coloradoâ€™s September 2, 1997 order imposing a public censure.Mr. Moskowitz filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against a third party on behalf of two clients. The bankruptcy petition was dismissed with an order assessing, among other sanctions, $66,271 in attorneyâ€™s fees and actual damages against Mr. Moskowitz. The bankruptcy court found that Mr. Moskowitz either failed to make a diligent pre-filing inquiry, or recklessly chose to ignore evidence that the petition was groundless. Mr. Moskowitz and one of his clients were held jointly and severally liable for an additional $3,209 in attorneyâ€™s fees when the court denied his motion to vacate the bankruptcy court judgment. Mr. Moskowitz paid all attorneyâ€™s fees assessed against him.

620.html,23649,Peter Slowiaczek,,Disbarment,5/11/2004,,"Peter A. Slowiaczek (WSBA No. 23649, admitted 1994), of Lakewood, was disbarred, effective May 11, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court, following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2000 and 2001 involving theft of client funds and making false statements to the federal government. In September 2001, Mr. Slowiaczek's payroll check to his administrative assistant was not honored by his bank. In October 2001, Mr. Slowiaczek paid his assistant from client funds in his pooled client trust account. At this time, Mr. Slowiaczek had negative balances in his office account, his personal bank account, and his own funds in his pooled client trust account. Mr. Slowiaczek provided inconsistent testimony to explain his use of his client trust account that the hearing officer found not credible. Mr. Slowiaczek replaced the trust funds with a back-dated check. In November 2001, Mr. Slowiaczek issued advance fee deposit refund checks to two clients. He issued these checks from his pooled client trust account even though he deposited the clients' funds into his office checking account. Neither of these clients had any funds in Mr. Slowiaczek's trust account. Mr. Slowiaczek replaced these funds in February 2002. In March 2002, Mr. Slowiaczek used more than $7,000 in client funds from his pooled client trust account to pay his mortgage. Mr. Slowiaczek offered inconsistent and noncredible testimony on this issue during the hearing. In May 2002, Mr. Slowiaczek received an advance fee deposit check. He failed to deposit this check into any bank account. Later in May, Mr. Slowiaczek wrote a check transferring this amount from his pooled client trust account to his office account. Mr. Slowiaczek offered inconsistent and noncredible testimony about this transaction during the hearing. On May 6, 2002, Mr. Slowiaczek wrote a $1,700 check to himself from his pooled client trust account. Mr. Slowiaczek knew that he did not have funds in this account and that he was exerting unauthorized control over client funds. Mr. Slowiaczek's intentional acts depriving clients of their funds in his pooled client trust account constitute theft. Mr. Slowiaczek commingled his client trust account funds and his personal funds. During the time period of the audit, Mr. Slowiaczek placed more than $50,000 of his own money in his client trust account, and paid more than $40,000 of business or personal expenses from the client trust account.Mr. Slowiaczek deposited some client advance fee deposits into his office account rather than his client trust account. He treated these funds as his own prior to performing any work. Mr. Slowiaczek did not enter written fee agreements with clients, and refunded money from his client trust account to conceal this conduct.Beginning in 1996, Mr. Slowiaczek represented a client in an offer and compromise process with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In November 2000, the client received more than $57,000 from a lawsuit settlement. Mr. Slowiaczek did not represent the client in this lawsuit, but allowed the client to use his trust account to hide the funds from the IRS. Mr. Slowiaczek sent several payments to the client and the client's family members from his trust account. Mr. Slowiaczek also failed to disclose the settlement funds to the IRS and provided false explanations for funds in at least two letters written during this time. Mr. Slowiaczek's conduct constituted two federal felonies. Mr. Slowiaczek's conduct violated RPCs 8.4(b), prohibiting committing a criminal act [RCW 9A.56.030-.040, First and Second Degree Theft; 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1001, knowingly and willfully making a materially false or fraudulent statement or representation to the Federal Government; and 26 U.S.C.

This discipline was based on his commission of two assaults.In 2004, Mr. Stocker engaged in a verbal altercation with two men outside of a nightclub in Seattle. Mr. Stocker punched both men, causing each of them to fall to the ground. According to witnesses, Mr. Stocker then struck one of the men again while the man was lying on the ground. Mr. Stocker's actions resulted in physical injuries to both men. As Mr. Stocker attempted to leave the scene, he was stopped by two police officers. According to the officers, Mr. Stocker appeared highly intoxicated, and he attempted to use his position as a city attorney to dissuade the officers from arresting him.Mr. Stocker was charged with and pleaded guilty to the felony crime of assault in the third degree and the misdemeanor crime of assault in the fourth degree.Mr. Stocker's conduct violated RPC 8.4(i), which prohibits a lawyer from committing any act of unjustified assault, whether committed in the course of his or her conduct as a lawyer or otherwise, and whether or not the act constitutes a felony or a misdemeanor.Leslie Ching Allen represented the Bar Association.

This discipline is based on his conduct in 2000 and 2001 involving conflict of interest and loaning money to a client in a litigation matter.In January 2000, Mr. Danko agreed to represent two clients in personal-injury claims against a trucking company (Company). In January 2001, Mr. Danko loaned client B money to pay his union dues. Mr. Danko prepared a waiver-of-conflict-of-interest form stating that if a conflict developed, he would withdraw from representing both clients. In November 2001, client A's claim settled. She did not sign the conflict-waiver form until July 2002. In May 2001, client B discharged Mr. Danko and retained new counsel. In December 2001, client A told Mr. Danko that client B overstated his injuries. Mr. Danko advised the client that she could contact the Company. At client A's request, Mr. Danko arranged a meeting between client A and the Company's lawyer. Client A gave deposition testimony adverse to client B's interests.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 2000 involving forging a client's signature and submitting the forgery to the court and opposing counsel. In 2000, Mr. Guarnero agreed to represent a client in her lawsuit against King County alleging a sexual assault while she was an in-patient at a treatment facility. The county's summary judgment motion was set for May 19, 2000. On May 10, 2000, the client drove to the office and signed her declaration. Due to a copy-machine error, the signature page of the client's declaration was omitted from the copy sent to the prosecutor and to the judge. The court considered the client's declaration, denied the summary judgment motion, and ordered Mr. Guarnero to fax a copy of the executed signature page to the court and counsel by 4:30 that afternoon. Unsure he could locate the original, Mr. Guarnero asked his assistant to call the client to have her come down to the office, but didnâ€™t reach her.  By the time the client called back, Guarnero told her he had found the signed copy. Mr. Guarnero then forged the client's name on a second copy of the declaration and faxed the forgery to the court and to the prosecutor. Based on expert testimony that the signature was a forgery, the court did not grant reconsideration.  It held a hearing on the summary judgment motion at which the client testified, but the court did not rule at that time.  The parties settled before she ruled. Mr. Guarnero continued to represent the client after the forgery was discovered and did not advise the client of a potential conflict of interest. Mr. Guarnero's conduct violated RPCs 8.4(b), prohibiting committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects [RCW 9A.60.020, Forgery]; 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting knowingly making a false statement of law or material fact to a tribunal; 3.3(a)(4), prohibiting offering evidence the lawyer knows to be false; 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed of the status of their matters; and 1.7(b), prohibiting lawyers from representing clients if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyer's own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after a full disclosure.Thomas V.

Weinberg (WSBA No. 18622, admitted 1989), of Woodinville, was suspended for two years, effective September 17, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2003 and 2004 involving failure to return unearned portions of client fees in four matters and his violations of the conditions of two suspended misdemeanor sentences.Matter 1: In August 2003, Mr. Weinberg was hired to represent a client charged with second-degree murder in Snohomish County. He was paid a $12,000 fee by the clientâ€™s parents. He subsequently told them that he would require payment of up to an additional $8,000 for investigative costs and to associate with another lawyer. Shortly thereafter, the client terminated the representation and requested an accounting and a refund of any unearned portion of the fee. Mr. Weinberg never provided an accounting. Although he had not filed a notice of appearance, Mr. Weinberg claimed he had visited the crime scene, visited the client at the jail, and reviewed discovery materials. At the time of entry into the disciplinary stipulation, Mr. Weinberg had agreed to refund $9,000 but had repaid only $3,250.Matter 2: Following his conviction of two counts of unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine in Thurston County, a client, whose conviction was on appeal, hired Mr. Weinberg in obtaining an appeal bond. In January and February 2004, the clientâ€™s brother wired Mr. Weinberg a total of $10,000. Mr. Weinberg subsequently contacted the clientâ€™s appointed appellate counsel, who had already filed the Brief of Appellant, and stated that he would be taking over the appeal and would prepare and file appropriate paperwork. Mr. Weinberg never sent such paperwork and never appeared as counsel in the appeal.In March and April 2004, Mr. Weinberg spoke to the prosecuting attorney by telephone on a number of occasions about the procedures for obtaining an appeal bond. The prosecuting attorney suggested that he file a written motion and contact the judgeâ€™s assistant to schedule a hearing. Mr. Weinberg told the clientâ€™s brother that a hearing would be held on March 12, 2004. During the course of a series of telephone conversations between Mr. Weinberg and the judgeâ€™s assistant, the projected date changed several times. Mr. Weinberg never filed a written motion to obtain an appeal bond. When a member of the clientâ€™s family learned that no hearing had been noted, the client terminated the representation and demanded a full refund. At the time of his entry into the disciplinary stipulation, Mr. Weinberg had agreed to refund $9,000.Matter 3: Commencing in December 2003, Mr. Weinberg represented a client charged with driving under the influence and possession of marijuana in Lynwood Municipal Court. The client paid Mr. Weinberg $2,500. In January 2004, Mr. Weinberg filed petitions for deferred prosecutions in both matters. At a hearing in March 2004, Mr. Weinberg failed to submit paperwork needed to demonstrate that the client was in treatment. Mr. Weinberg failed to appear for a second hearing in March 2004. At a hearing in April 2004, the client terminated the representation in open court. In May 2004, with the assistance of a public defender, the client succeeded in obtaining a deferred prosecution. At the time of his entry into the disciplinary stipulation, Mr. Weinberg had agreed to refund $500.Matter 4: Mr. Weinberg was hired to represent a client charged with driving under the influence in Bothell Municipal Court. The client paid Mr. Weinberg $1,000 of an agreed $2,500 fee. Mr. Weinberg appeared at the clientâ€™s arraignment in April 2004, but failed to appear at a May 2004 hearing until well after the client had been heard, and advised the court that he had been unable to contact Mr. Weinberg at any of his known telephone numbers. Shortly thereafter, by letter, the client terminated the representation and requested a refund of unearned fees. Mr. Weinberg asked the client to allow him to continue the representation at a reduced fee, and he proposed that the client meet him the next day. Mr. Weinberg failed to appear for the meeting or for the clientâ€™s June 2004 pretrial conference. At that time, the client again terminated the representation. At the time of his entry into the disciplinary stipulation, Mr. Weinberg had agreed to refund $800.Matter 5: In June 2002, having been charged with driving under the influence, Mr. Weinberg pleaded guilty to an amended charge of first-degree negligent driving in Pierce County District Court. Mr. Weinberg received a 90-day suspended sentence. A condition of the suspended sentence was that Mr. Weinberg have â€œno further violations for one year.â€ Less than one year later, in April 2003, Mr. Weinberg was charged with domestic violence malicious mischief in the third degree in Snohomish County District Court. In November 2003, Mr. Weinberg pleaded guilty to that charge and received a 365-day suspended sentence. Conditions of the suspended sentence included Mr. Weinbergâ€™s having â€œno charge/conviction of any criminal offenseâ€ and completion of a specified treatment program. Mr. Weinberg did not complete the treatment program, and in January 2004 he was charged with domestic violence in Snohomish County District Court.Mr. Weinbergâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.5(a), requiring that a lawyerâ€™s fee be reasonable; RPC 1.15(d), requiring that a lawyer take reasonably practicable steps to protect a clientâ€™s interests upon termination of representation (including refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned); RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting, inter alia, any act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; RPC 8.4(j), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order directing him or her to do, or ceasing to do, an act which he or she ought in good faith to do or forbear; and RPC 8.4(k), prohibiting a lawyer from violating his or her oath as an attorney (namely, â€œabide byâ€ the laws of the State of Washington).Linda B.

Johansen (WSBA No. 5211, admitted 1973), of Seattle, was suspended for three years, effective July 9, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation. This discipline was based on her conduct in 2000 involving drafting a will naming her as beneficiary. Ms. Johansen developed a friendship with two clients. Over several years, she took the clients to dinner; arranged for residential care; and assisted them with daily tasks such as banking, food shopping, obtaining prescription medications, and meeting healthcare providers. In 1997, the clients began asking Ms. Johansen to draft a new will for them naming herself as an alternate beneficiary. Ms. Johansen refused and the clients became upset. The clients eventually wrote up their own wills on blank will forms, naming Ms. Johansen as the alternate beneficiary. At the clientsâ€™ insistence, Ms. Johansen gave their wills to her secretary to type. She also drafted a codicil leaving the alternate beneficiary blank, which the clients did not use. In late January 2000, Ms. Johansen finalized the clientsâ€™ wills, inserting her name as alternate beneficiary. She advised the clients against naming her as a beneficiary, but did not explain that this might invalidate the wills. In March and April 2000, the clients executed the wills. One client died in January 2001 and the other in November 2001. In December 2001, Ms. Johansen was appointed personal representative with nonintervention powers. She transferred all of the estate funds into her name, but maintained the estate intact. The probate remained open at the time of the stipulation. Pursuant to the stipulation, Ms. Johansen renounced any interest in the estate. Ms. Johansenâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.8(c), prohibiting a lawyer from preparing an instrument giving the lawyer a substantial gift, including a testamentary gift.

Hughes (WSBA No. 15165, admitted 1985), of Portland, OR, was suspended from the practice of law for six months, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court, effective July 20, 2004, imposing reciprocal discipline based on an order from the state of Oregon. This discipline was based on his lack of diligence in a bankruptcy litigation matter. In March 1996, Mr. Hughes agreed to represent clients in a proceeding to determine the dischargability in bankruptcy of a judgment they obtained. The clients lived out of state and also had local counsel. Mr. Hughes failed to notify the clients that the court had set their case for trial. Local counsel advised Mr. Hughes that the case would no longer be pursued. Mr. Hughes agreed to notify the clients, but failed to do so. Later, the court dismissed the clientsâ€™ case for failure to prosecute. The clients terminated Mr. Hughesâ€™s employment and asked that he return their file. He returned a portion of the file after the clients contacted the Oregon State Bar. At the time of this conduct, Mr. Hughes was meeting with a probation monitor following a prior suspension. Mr. Hughes did not tell the probation monitor of his failures in the Hughes matter. Mr. Hughesâ€™s conduct violated Oregon Code of Professional Responsibility 1-102(A)(4), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; 6-101(B), prohibiting neglecting a legal matter entrusted to a lawyer; 7-101(A)(1), prohibiting intentionally failing to seek clientsâ€™ lawful objectives through reasonably available permissible means; and failing to promptly pay or deliver client property upon request.

This discipline is based on her failing to adequately supervise a nonlawyer assistant, contacting a represented party directly, and failing to comply with a deposition subpoena from 1996 through 2000.Matter 1: In November 1996, Ms. Bartu agreed to represent the husband in a marriage dissolution action. In February 1997, opposing counsel sent a proposed final decree to Ms. Bartu. The wife mistakenly believed that the divorce was final and married again. In April 1997, Ms. Bartu referred her client to her contract legal assistant regarding possible bigamy charges against his former wife. Ms. Bartu attended the conference in which the client and the legal assistant discussed the work to be performed. Ms. Bartu knew that the legal assistant intended to contact the wife directly about the bigamy allegation and the potential for criminal prosecution. The legal assistant contacted the wife on April 14, 1997, and suggested to her that if she would give her interest in the marital home to the husband, the legal assistant would not report the bigamy. On July 2, the husband called the wife from Ms. Bartuâ€™s office to discuss terms of the settlement, and asked her to sign final documents at Ms. Bartuâ€™s office, but she refused.Matter 2: In May 1997, Ms. Bartu agreed to represent the husband in a marriage dissolution matter. On August 19, Ms. Bartu sent opposing counsel a letter indicating that he could talk to her client directly. Opposing counsel responded, declining to contact Ms. Bartuâ€™s client. After receiving opposing counselâ€™s letter, her client sent a letter to his wife, which Ms. Bartu edited and typed. The letter proposed a property distribution and suggested that opposing counsel did not have the wifeâ€™s best interests in mind.Matter 3: Ms. Bartu failed to respond to written requests for information from the Bar Association. After receiving a subpoena and notice for deposition, Ms. Bartu sent a letter to the Bar Association refusing to attend the deposition in Seattle, as required by the Rules for Lawyer Discipline. Ms. Bartu failed to appear for the deposition.Ms. Bartuâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 5.3(b) and (c), requiring lawyers to supervise nonlawyer assistants and make reasonable efforts to ensure an assistantâ€™s conduct is compatible with the lawyerâ€™s professional obligations; 4.2, prohibiting communicating about the subject matter of the representation with a party the lawyer knows is represented, without opposing counselâ€™s consent; 8.4(a), prohibiting attempting to violate the RPCs through the acts of another; and RLD 2.8, requiring lawyers to promptly comply with requests for information relevant to grievances.Becky Neal represented the Bar Association.

631.html,18316,Wm. Romero,,Disbarment,7/22/2004,,"Wm. Guillermo Romero (WSBA No. 18316, admitted 1988), of Moses Lake, was disbarred, effective July 22, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct from 1997 through 2001 involving charging fees while representing clients at public expense, failing to file federal income tax returns, failing to diligently represent a client, failing to deposit a client's funds in a trust account, making misleading statements, and failing to cooperate with the disciplinary investigations. For additional information, please see In re Discipline of Romero, 94 P.3d 939 (2004).Matter 1: In three client matters, Mr. Romero charged attorney's fees even though he was appointed to represent the clients at county expense. Mr. Romero did not explain to the clients that the county was obligated to pay the costs of the representation. In one case, Mr. Romero asked the client's mother for $10,000 to retain a particular mental-health expert. Matter 2: A client gave Mr. Romero a check to cover the client's court costs and crime-victim-compensation assessment. Mr. Romero cashed the check, but did not pay the fees for three months. Mr. Romero did not have a trust account at this time. The client showed a copy of his check to a court clerk. When the clerk contacted Mr. Romero, he made misleading statements about the client's funds. Matter 3: Mr. Romero was appointed to represent a criminal defendant on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea. The court denied the motion, and the client told Mr. Romero that he wanted to file an appeal. Mr. Romero did not file the appeal. Mr. Romero wrongly advised the client that his guilty plea waived his right to appeal the court's denial of his motion to withdraw that plea. Matter 4: Mr. Romero was appointed to represent a Mexican national on a criminal charge. Mr. Romero negligently advised the client that he could travel to Mexico without obtaining the necessary bail modifications. Matter 5: Mr. Romero failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000. He filed the returns for 1997 through 1999 three days prior to a deposition set in the disciplinary investigation of this matter. The hearing officer found that Mr. Romero would not have filed these returns but for the Association's investigation. Mr. Romero owed approximately $150,000 in back taxes, interest, and penalties. Matter 6: Mr. Romero failed to cooperate with seven disciplinary investigations. Mr. Romero's conduct violated RPCs 1.1, requiring lawyers to provide competent representation to clients; 1.2(a), requiring lawyers to abide by clients' decisions regarding the objectives of the representation; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.4(a), requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed of the status of their matters; 1.4(b), requiring lawyers to explain matters to the extent reasonably necessary for clients to make informed decisions; 1.5(a), requiring lawyers to charge reasonable fees; 1.14(a), requiring lawyers to place client funds in a trust account; 7.1, prohibiting lawyers from making false or misleading statements about their services; 8.4(b), prohibiting committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyers' honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; 8.4(c), prohibiting engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; 8.4(i), prohibiting committing an act involving moral turpitude; and RLD 2.8(a) [now ELC 5.3(e) and (f)], requiring lawyers to promptly respond to requests for information relevant to matters under investigation.Christine Gray and Jean McElroy represented the Association.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 2002 involving withholding information regarding his status as a lawyer during a Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) matter. In December 2002, Mr. Mosley agreed to assist a friend in contesting the L&I dismissal of his workersâ€™ compensation claim. Mr. Mosley sent L&I a written notice of appearance and request for reconsideration of the friendâ€™s claim. Mr. Mosley told the friend that because he was not experienced in these cases, he would appear only until the friend could find another lawyer to represent him. The next day, he appeared with the friend at an independent medical exam (IME). WAC 296-23-362 allows friends, but not lawyers or legal representatives, to attend IMEs. Mr. Mosley told the doctor that he was a friend and identified himself as friend on the witness form he signed. Mr. Mosley believed that he did not need to disclose that he was the attorney of record, because he intended to withdraw as soon as another lawyer could be located. The doctor reviewed Mr. Mosleyâ€™s notice of appearance prior to the exam, and ordered Mr. Mosley to leave the room.

Leen (WSBA No. 14208, admitted 1984), of Seattle, received a reprimand effective June 4, 2004, following a stipulation approved by the hearing officer. This discipline is based on his conduct in 1995 involving conflict of interest in a criminal matter and in 2002 involving negligent misrepresentation during the disciplinary investigation. In 1995, Mr. Leen agreed to represent two criminal defendants, clients A and B. Client A was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine and client B with possession of a firearm following a felony conviction. In December 1995, the prosecutor offered client A a plea agreement that required the client to ""provide truthful testimony if needed."" Client B was listed as a potential witness against client A, although the prosecutor told Mr. Leen that he did not actually intend to call client B. Because Mr. Leen represented both defendants, he could have been precluded from calling one to testify in defense of the other. A jury found client A guilty. Client A then filed a motion to vacate his sentence, claiming that Mr. Leen's simultaneous representation caused an actual conflict of interest. In July 2002, Mr. Leen gave deposition testimony on this matter. Mr. Leen testified that he did not discuss the potential conflict with client A, and that he did not disclose the conflict to the judge. In letters to the Bar Association, Mr. Leen made conflicting statements. Mr. Leen's client file was destroyed prior to his letter and his memory could have faded. Mr. Leen's letter also referred the Association to the deposition transcript. Mr. Leen's conduct violated RPCs 1.7(b), prohibiting lawyers from representing a client if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client; and 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and ELC 5.3(e), requiring lawyers to promptly respond to requests for information relevant to grievances or matters under investigation.

64.html,17299,Martha Schaeffer,,Suspension,1/12/2000,,"Martha G. Schaeffer (WSBA No. 17299, admitted 1987), of Silverdale, has been suspended for 90 days, following a stipulation, by order of the Supreme Court dated January 12, 2000. The discipline is based upon her failure to diligently represent two clients and failure to properly preserve client funds.Matter 1: In May 1993, Ms. Schaeffer agreed to represent two clients in a wrongful termination suit against their employer. Between September 1994 and April 1995, she filed the complaint, sent interrogatories, conducted legal research, and took two depositions. Ms. Schaeffer took no further actions on the clientsâ€™ cases. In June 1996, the court clerk mailed Ms. Schaeffer a Notice to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution. Ms. Schaeffer requested a 30-day delay, but took no other action. In September 1996, the Court dismissed the clientsâ€™ case. When the clients contacted Ms. Schaeffer in October 1996, she did not tell them about the dismissal. The clients later learned from the court that their case had been dismissed. Ms. Schaefferâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to diligently represent a client; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to expedite clientsâ€™ litigation; and RPC 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters.Matter 2: In February 1993, Ms. Schaeffer agreed to represent the husband in a dissolution action. The client was partially disabled and unable to speak. In January 1994, the parties put an oral settlement agreement on the court record. In August 1994, the client granted his son a Durable Power of Attorney, giving the son general authority to handle the fatherâ€™s financial affairs. At the same time, the client granted Ms. Schaeffer a limited power of attorney to access some of the clientâ€™s accounts to pay the community bills. Ms. Schaeffer paid the community bills with a signature stamp. In September 1994, the court entered the final dissolution decree, which stated that the personal property should be divided equally. The parties could not agree on the division, so the court appointed a special master. Although the client requested a new lawyer on October 31, 1994, Ms. Schaeffer continued to represent the client until early 1996, but did not complete the property distribution. In November 1994, Ms. Schaeffer received notice that the Social Security Administration would not continue to pay the clientâ€™s benefits unless it received additional information. Ms. Schaeffer did not send the additional information, and the clientâ€™s benefits were suspended. Additionally, during this time Ms. Schaeffer did not pay all of the community bills. She did not provide the necessary documentation to the son for the clientâ€™s tax returns. She sent the client three bills between February 1993 and November 1995. She paid herself $12,251.35, using the clientâ€™s signature stamp in December 1994, January 1995 and February 1995. The son stated that he did not authorize these payments, and Ms. Schaeffer had no contact with the client at this time. Ms. Schaeffer did not maintain complete records of the clientâ€™s funds and was not able to provide an accounting. She used funds on behalf of one client to advance costs on behalf of another. Although the client obtained new counsel in early 1996, Ms. Schaeffer did not return the signature stamp and other property until August 1998.Disciplinary Counsel Kevin Bank represented the Bar Association.

This discipline was based on his conduct between 1999 and 2002 involving making false statements and failing to correct misapprehensions known to have arisen in connection with applications for bar admission. In November 1999, Mr. Duggan applied for admission to the Hawaii State Bar Association. In the signed and notarized application, Mr. Duggan represented that he had read the application and the required forms; that all questions had been answered candidly, fully, frankly, and truthfully; and that the answers were complete and true to the best of his knowledge. He further represented under oath that he understood that the application was of a continuing nature and that he would notify the Board of Examiners of the Hawaii Supreme Court in writing of any change in the information.In responding to three application questions, Mr. Duggan failed to disclose material information or provided false answers.In November 2000, Mr. Duggan again applied for admission to the Hawaii State Bar Association. Except for the signature page, the November 2000 application was a duplicate of the November 1999 application.In May 2001, Mr. Duggan again applied for admission to the Hawaii State Bar Association. Except for the signature page, the May 2001 application was a duplicate of the November 1999 application.In August 2001, while the May 2001 application was pending, Mr. Duggan was arrested. In December 2001, the charge was dismissed with prejudice. Although the information regarding his August 2001 arrest was pertinent to one of the application questions and should have been provided as supplemental information, Mr. Duggan failed to supplement his pending application with that information. Having passed Hawaiiâ€™s June 2001 bar examination, Mr. Duggan was admitted to the practice of law in the state of Hawaii on January 25, 2002.Mr. Dugganâ€™s conduct violated Hawaii Rule of Professional Conduct (HRPC) 8.1(a), prohibiting an applicant for bar admission from knowingly making a false statement of material fact; HRPC 8.1(b), prohibiting an applicant for bar admission from failing to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known to have arisen in the matter; HRPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and HRPC 8.4(a), designating as professional misconduct a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.Christine Gray represented the Bar Association.

Alipuria (WSBA No. 26899, admitted 1997), of Tacoma, was suspended for 90 days, effective September 15, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation. This discipline was based on his conduct in failing to competently and diligently represent a client and in failing to comply with the terms of a prior disciplinary stipulation.  Matter 1: Mr. Alipuria represented a client who had been charged with first-degree assault of a child for allegedly intentionally burning his infant son. Although the clientâ€™s spouse was originally charged with the crime, those charges were dismissed after the client informed the spouseâ€™s lawyer that the client had accidentally burned the child. The defense theory of the case was that the spouse had burned the infant and the client had then fabricated the story of his involvement to protect her.  â€¢   Prior to trial, Mr. Alipuria moved to suppress the testimony of the spouseâ€™s lawyer. Although Mr. Alipuria knew that the issue turned on the clientâ€™s subjective belief that an attorney-client relationship existed with the other lawyer, Mr. Alipuria failed to call the client to testify at the hearing and failed to offer any other evidence of the clientâ€™s subjective belief. The motion was denied. â€¢   Mr. Alipuria listed the clientâ€™s seven-year-old child as a trial witness. Mr. Alipuria and the client believed that the child would testify that the spouse burned the infant. Mr. Alipuria did not interview the child prior to trial, nor did he call the child as a witness. â€¢   Knowing that the spouse had taken a polygraph examination, Mr. Alipuria moved prior to trial to exclude any reference to the polygraph examination. Despite having been instructed not to do so, the spouse volunteered during her testimony that she had taken a polygraph examination. Mr. Alipuria did not object, ask for a curative instruction, or move for a mistrial.  â€¢   Prior to trial, the client had taken a number of polygraph examinations. He believed that the results were inconclusive. The client requested that Mr. Alipuria not disclose the results of the examinations with the prosecuting attorney. Mr. Alipuria nonetheless volunteered to the prosecuting attorney that the client had failed a polygraph examination.  The jury found the client guilty. On appeal, the conviction was reversed and remanded, in part on grounds that Mr. Alipuria had provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter 2: In 2002, Mr. Alipuria entered into a disciplinary stipulation for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct in two prior matters. The terms of the stipulation imposed a probationary period requiring, inter alia, that Mr. Alipuria (1) propose a practice monitor within two weeks of the commencement of probation; and (2) within 30 days, provide proof of malpractice insurance coverage or of the rejection of his applications for such coverage. Respondent did not propose a practice monitor or apply for malpractice coverage within the time frames required by the stipulation. Mr. Alipuriaâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; 1.3, requiring a lawyer act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; and 1.6, prohibiting a lawyer from revealing a clientâ€™s confidences or secrets unless the client consents after consultation; and former RLDs 1.1(m), subjecting a lawyer to discipline for failure to meet the conditions of probation or a stipulation; and 5.2(b), subjecting a lawyer to discipline for failure to comply with a condition of probation.

645.html,27787,Adina Atwood,,Disbarment,9/15/2004,,"Adina A. Atwood (WSBA No. 27787, admitted 1998), of Kent, was disbarred, effective September 15, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on her conduct in 2001 through 2003 involving abandonment of her law practice, multiple acts of misconduct in representing individual clients, and failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation. In the summer of 2002, Ms. Atwood abandoned her law practice. She removed client files from her law office, but did not return the client files to the clients or to the law office. She did not inform clients that she had abandoned her law practice and had ceased handling their legal matters. She took no action to return remaining client funds in her trust account to the rightful owners.Matter 1: In 2002, a client paid Ms. Atwood $3,000 to represent her in a dissolution matter. The client directed Ms. Atwood to obtain a temporary restraining order because she feared that her husband would physically harm her. Ms. Atwood obtained an ex parte restraining order that failed to include a provision preventing the husband from entering the family residence. Consequently, Ms. Atwood was obliged to request an amended order that included such a provision. At a hearing on the entry of temporary orders at which the client was not present, Ms. Atwood agreed to a provision allowing the husband to have access to the family home to remove certain property. Ms. Atwood failed to notify the client of this provision. The client did not learn of the provision until the husband appeared at her home with a copy of the order. When the client terminated Ms. Atwoodâ€™s services, the client requested an itemized bill and a refund of the remaining balance. Ms. Atwood never responded to these requests, never contacted the client, and did not file a notice of withdrawal. The client obtained a default judgment against Ms. Atwood in small claims court for $3,036.Matter 2: In 2002, a client paid Ms. Atwood $950 to represent her in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Following commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding, a judgment creditor continued to enforce an order of garnishment against the client. The client paid Ms. Atwood an additional $150 to quash the garnishment. Ms. Atwood failed to file a motion to quash or to do anything else to prevent the judgment creditor from garnishing the clientâ€™s wages. Despite the clientâ€™s repeated efforts to contact her, Ms. Atwood failed to communicate with the client. Although the client obtained a refund of $300 in garnished wages, she lost $648 as a result of Ms. Atwoodâ€™s failure to take action.Matter 3: In 1998 or 1999, a client with mental-health and substance-abuse problems hired Ms. Atwood to represent her in various matters, including a marital dissolution. Under the terms of a stipulated property distribution, Ms. Atwood, on the clientâ€™s behalf, was to receive $18,760 pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order. Out of that sum Ms. Atwood was to discharge an $8,500 third-party debt and provide the lawyer for the former spouse with proof of payment. Following receipt of the proceeds in January 2001, Ms. Atwood deposited the sum into her trust account. Shortly thereafter, although she had no client authorization to do so, Ms. Atwood disbursed $12,000 to herself. At the time, Ms. Atwood was not owed $12,000 by the client. When the lawyer for the former spouse inquired about discharge of the debt, Ms. Atwood intentionally misrepresented to him that she was waiting for the check to clear. Ms. Atwood disregarded further communications from the lawyer. In April 2002, Ms. Atwood disbursed to herself another $2,000 of the clientâ€™s money without the clientâ€™s authority, knowledge, or consent. Ms. Atwood took no steps to return the funds remaining in her trust account to the client.Matter 4: In April 2002, a client paid Ms. Atwood $775 to represent her in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. After filing the bankruptcy, Ms. Atwood failed to inform the client of the date for the meeting of creditors, and did not attend the meeting of creditors. Ms. Atwood never contacted the client again about the bankruptcy, which was dismissed in October 2002 because no one had appeared at the meeting of creditors.Matter 5: Ms. Atwood did not respond to Bar Association requests for information about and responses to the grievances in matters 1 through 4 above. In April 2003, Ms. Atwood failed to appear for a deposition as required by a subpoena duces tecum. Owing to her failure to cooperate with the Bar Associationâ€™s disciplinary investigation, on August 6, 2003, the Supreme Court suspended Ms. Atwood from the practice of law pending the outcome of disciplinary proceedings.Ms. Atwoodâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions; RPC 1.5(a), requiring that a lawyerâ€™s fee be reasonable; RPC 1.14, requiring a lawyer to deposit client funds into a trust account and to pay to the client funds that the client is entitled to receive; RPC 1.15(d), requiring that a lawyer take reasonably practicable steps to protect a clientâ€™s interests upon termination of representation (including surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned); RPC 4.1(a), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting commission of a criminal act (namely, theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct.Jonathan H.

646.html,23580,Michael Johnson-Ortiz,,Disbarment,9/15/2004,,"Michael T. Johnson-Ortiz (WSBA No. 23580, admitted 1994), of ConcepciÃ³n, Chile (formerly of Seattle), was disbarred, effective September 15, 2004, by an order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 1998 and 2003 involving abandonment of his practice and multiple acts of misconduct involving immigration clients. Matter 1: Sometime prior to December 12, 2003, Mr. Johnson-Ortiz decided to leave his law practice and move to Chile. By January 5, 2004, Mr. Johnson-Ortiz had abandoned his law practice. During November and December 2003, Mr. Johnson-Ortiz received money from two clients for work he did not intend to perform. A third client was not able to locate Mr. Johnson-Ortiz to make a payment. Mr. Johnson-Ortiz did not notify any of these clients that he would no longer represent them. Matter 2: In 1998, Mr. Johnson-Ortiz represented a client in a motion to reopen removal proceedings. In April 1998, Mr. Johnson-Ortiz signed a letter stating that the motion to reopen was pending before a judge, when in fact, he had not filed the motion. Mr. Johnson-Ortiz did not timely file the motion, and the court denied the clientâ€™s request to reopen. Matter 3: In 1999, Mr. Johnson-Ortiz agreed to represent clients who were married while Ms. A was a U.S. citizen and Mr. A was in the United States illegally from Mexico. In September 2000, Mr. Johnson-Ortiz advised Mr. A that he must return to Mexico prior to a visa consular interview. On December 27, 2000, Mr. Johnson-Ortiz suggested that Mr. A return to the United States and apply for a change of status under new regulations, even though those regulations applied only to applicants physically in the United States on December 21, 2000. In January 2001, the client returned to the U.S. illegally. The INS determined that Mr. A did not qualify for permanent resident status under the new regulations, and ordered his voluntary departure. Mr. A returned to Mexico and Ms. A remains in the United States. Mr. Johnson-Ortiz failed to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation of this matter. Matter 4: In 1999, Mr. Johnson-Ortiz agreed to represent three family members in an attempt to obtain cancellation of their INS removal orders. He intentionally failed to meet with the clients prior to the cancellation hearing. At the hearing, the immigration judge ordered the mother and child to voluntarily depart the United States. Also during the hearing, Mr. Johnson-Ortiz conceded that the fatherâ€™s conduct constituted the crime of aiding and abetting the mother and childâ€™s unlawful entry into the country. Mr. Johnson-Ortiz did not discuss this issue with the client, nor contact the mother or child for possible testimony prior to making this concession. In March 2000, Mr. Johnson-Ortizâ€™s office filed appeals for all three clients. In April 2003, the appeals were still pending. During this time, Mr. Johnson-Ortiz did not advise the client of any other method of obtaining citizenship. Matter 5: In October 2002, Mr. Johnson-Ortiz represented a client in removal proceedings. Due to an office mistake, the client was not notified of the removal hearing and Mr. Johnson-Ortiz did not attend. Mr. Johnson-Ortiz continued to represent the client, filing a motion to reopen and then appealing the denial of that motion. In the appeal, Mr. Johnson-Ortiz argued his own ineffective assistance of counsel, but did not advise the client of the conflict of interest.Matter 6: The Bar Association audited Mr. Johnson-Ortizâ€™s trust account for the period January through August 2003. During that period, he did not maintain check registers or client registers. He also deposited cost advances to his general account, commingled his own funds with the client funds in his trust account, and had insufficient trust account funds to cover 14 client withdrawals. Mr. Johnson-Ortiz paid court filing fees from his trust account for clients who had no money deposited in that account. Matter 7: In January 2003, Mr. Johnson-Ortiz represented a client in removal proceedings based on a criminal conviction. He did not meet with the client or the expert witness prior to the hearing. During the oral ruling ordering the clientâ€™s removal from the United States, Mr. Johnson-Ortiz asked to withdraw from the case based on â€œrepugnance.â€ Mr. Johnson-Ortizâ€™s personal repugnance to his client created a conflict of interest and interfered with the representation. Mr. Johnson-Ortiz did not discuss this conflict with his client. Mr. Johnson-Ortiz failed to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation of this matter. Mr. Johnson-Ortizâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.1, requiring lawyers to provide competent representation to clients; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent clients; 1.5, requiring lawyers to charge reasonable fees; 1.7(b), prohibiting lawyers from representing a client if the representation is materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests; 1.14(a), requiring lawyers to deposit client funds in an IOLTA account and maintain the account in accordance with the RPCs; 3.1, prohibiting lawyers from making frivolous claims; 8.4(b), prohibiting committing a criminal act [theft] that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; 8.4(i), prohibiting committing an act of moral turpitude; and 8.4(l), prohibiting violating a duty under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Discipline.Christine Gray represented the Bar Association.

647.html,21247,S. Phelps,,Disbarment,9/17/2004,,"S. Don Phelps (WSBA No. 21247, admitted 1991), of Olympia, was disbarred, effective September 17, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct in two matters involving the commission of criminal acts, failure to avoid a conflict of interest, having sexual relations with a client, and engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. Matter 1: On August 12, 2002, Mr. Phelps was charged with two counts of first-degree child molestation based on allegations that, inter alia, he reached into the pants and fondled the genitalia of a 15-year-old boy who was staying overnight at his home. In November 2002, a jury convicted Mr. Phelps on both counts. He was sentenced to a 17.5-month term of confinement.Matter 2: Mr. Phelps represented a client charged with second-degree murder in Thurston County Superior Court. The client was released from custody prior to trial. The conditions of release included requirements that the client reside with his grandmother and be at her home between 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., that when not at work or at home he be accompanied by someone at least 25 years old and aware of the restrictions, and that he not possess or consume alcohol. Violation of the conditions of pretrial release could have resulted in the clientâ€™s incarceration pending trial.Mr. Phelps assisted and encouraged the client in violating the conditions of pretrial release by having the client spend the night at his home, by having the client run errands without being accompanied by someone over the age of 25, by supplying the client with alcoholic drinks, and by allowing the client to drink alcoholic beverages in front to him. When the client asked Mr. Phelps whether these actions were in violation of his pretrial release, Mr. Phelps assured him that it was permissible either because the client was going to see his lawyer, because the client was following the directions of his lawyer, or because Mr. Phelps had â€œtaken care of it.â€ During this period, Mr. Phelps gave the client gifts and money, bought him meals, greeted him with hugs, and complimented him on his physique. On one occasion, while the client was showering in Mr. Phelpsâ€™s home, Mr. Phelps entered the bathroom; while the client was attempting to attire himself, Mr. Phelps grabbed the clientâ€™s genitalia. The client instructed Mr. Phelps not to go any further.Mr. Phelpsâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after a full disclosure; RPC 1.8(k), prohibiting a lawyer from having sexual relations with a current client; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (namely, child molestation and assault) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; and former RLD 1.1(a), which prohibits a lawyer from, inter alia, committing any unjustified act of assault or any act which reflects disregard for the rule of law.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

Willas Miller (WSBA No. 25454, admitted 1995), of Seattle, was disbarred, effective September 17, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct in 1999 involving commission of several violations of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act.In February 1999, Mr. Miller was charged by information in King County Superior Court with five felony violations of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act. In July 2000, a jury convicted Mr. Miller of three counts of delivery of a controlled substance and one count of attempted delivery of a controlled substance. In September 2000, Mr. Miller was sentenced to 48 months in prison.Mr. Millerâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(i), which prohibits a lawyer from, inter alia, committing any act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; and RPC 8.4(k), prohibiting a lawyer from violating his or her oath as an attorney (namely, the oath to â€œabide byâ€ the laws of the state of Washington).Douglas J.

649.html,11611,Phillip Egger,,Suspension,9/30/2004,,"Phillip E. Egger (WSBA No. 11611, admitted 1981), of Bellevue, was suspended for six months, effective September 30, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 1989 involving billing a client for work that had already been paid for by a third party and failing to obtain a clientâ€™s written consent to a potential conflict of interest. For additional information please see In re Discipline of Egger, 152 Wn.2d 393, 98 P.3d 477 (2004). Matter 1: In 1989, Mr. Egger assisted Client A in making a loan to a condominium development. The loan documents provided that the borrower would pay the lenderâ€™s legal fees up to $15,000. Mr. Egger billed Client A $21,000 for attorney fees and costs incurred in the loan transaction. Although the borrower paid Mr. Eggerâ€™s firm $15,000 for legal fees, the payment was not credited to Client Aâ€™s account, and Client A also paid the full $21,000 bill. Matter 2: In 1985, Client B contacted Mr. Eggerâ€™s law firm regarding representation of her interests as an unsecured creditor in a bankruptcy proceeding filed by a third party, to whom Client B had loaned $66,000. Client B did not recover the amount of the loan. In 1989, Client B persuaded another of Mr. Eggerâ€™s clients, Client A, to loan $300,000 to the third-party debtor. Mr. Egger negotiated the loan. Although Client B was listed as a client in firm records at the time, and although Mr. Egger made efforts to secure $66,000 as payment to Client B out of the loan proceeds, Mr. Egger did not obtain Client Aâ€™s written consent after full disclosure of the conflict of interest. Mr. Eggerâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.5(a), requiring that a lawyerâ€™s fee be reasonable; and 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after a full disclosure.

Mitchell (WSBA No. 17401, admitted 1987), of Tacoma, has been suspended for 60 days following a stipulation by order of the Supreme Court dated April 13, 2000. The discipline is based upon his failure to diligently represent and accurately communicate with a client, failure to refund advanced costs, and failure to cooperate with the Bar Association.On August 6, 1990, a client retained Mr. Mitchell to collect unpaid trailer rental charges. The client paid Mr. Mitchell $200 for the court filing fee. Several weeks later when the client called, Mr. Mitchell told the client the lawsuit had been filed. The client called periodically for status updates and Mr. Mitchell told him the case was going well. Sometime prior to the summer of 1993, the client went to the Pierce County courthouse and learned that the lawsuit had not been filed. Two weeks later, Mr. Mitchell admitted he had not filed the lawsuit and promised to make the clientâ€™s case a priority.On June 28, 1993, Mr. Mitchell wrote to the opposing party, referring to himself as the clientâ€™s lawyer in a matter pending before the Superior Court of Pierce County. Mr. Mitchell told the client that he had scheduled depositions and that they were continued. The client took time off from work to attend the depositions. When they did not occur, Mr. Mitchell asked the client for documentation of his lost wages, stating that he would seek sanctions against the opposing party.On September 9, 1994, Mr. Mitchell admitted to the client that he had not filed the lawsuit or scheduled the depositions. Mr. Mitchell agreed to refund the clientâ€™s $200, but had not done so at the time the stipulation was signed. The client filed a grievance with the Bar Association. Mr. Mitchell did not respond to the Bar Associationâ€™s requests for information until he appeared for a deposition. He did not provide the documents requested in the subpoena duces tecum.Mr. Mitchellâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent clients; RPC 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients informed of the status of their matters and promptly respond to reasonable requests for information; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring lawyers to promptly deliver client funds held by the lawyer, upon request; RPC 1.15(d), requiring lawyers to protect clientsâ€™ interests when withdrawing from a case; and RLD 2.8, requiring lawyers to cooperate with Bar Association investigations.Marsha Matsumoto represented the Bar Association.

Folinsky (WSBA No. 20687, admitted 1991), of Los Angeles, CA, was ordered to receive two reprimands, effective September 30, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court imposing reciprocal discipline in accordance with orders of the State Bar Court of the State of California. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2002, 2003, and 2004, involving acts of misconduct in multiple immigration matters.  Matter 1: This matter comprises misconduct in three client matters.  â€¢    In 2002, a client paid Mr. Folinsky $900 to prepare an I-360 visa petition. Mr. Folinsky failed to timely file the petition, and the client was subject to deportation proceedings.  â€¢    In September 2003, Mr. Folinsky was paid $3,000 to represent two clients in an immigration matter. In October 2003, the clients terminated the representation and hired another lawyer. Although the clients repeatedly requested that he do so, Mr. Folinsky failed to promptly refund the unearned fees.  â€¢    In 2001, Mr. Folinsky was hired to prepare an Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker, Form I-140. After numerous inquiries from the client, Mr. Folinsky discovered in February 2004 that he had never filed the petition. Matter 2: This matter comprises misconduct in two client matters.  â€¢    In 1993, a client paid Mr. Folinsky $1,500 to represent her in connection with an application for asylum. From November 1993 through mid-1995, Mr. Folinsky took no affirmative steps to respond to an INS letter expressing an intention to deny the application for asylum, and he did not communicate with the client. In August 1995, following her marriage, the client paid Mr. Folinsky another $465 for an adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident. Mr. Folinsky did not respond to the clientâ€™s numerous requests for information, and failed to file any documents on behalf of the client. The client sued Mr. Folinsky, seeking return of all fees paid to him, and a judgment was entered against him.  â€¢   In 1996, Mr. Folinsky was paid $560 to file a petition for permanent residence. Mr. Folinsky did not file the petition, nor did he respond to numerous client inquiries concerning the status of the case. Although the client terminated the representation and requested a refund, Mr. Folinsky failed to promptly refund the unearned fees. Mr. Folinskyâ€™s conduct violated California Business and Professions Code Â§ 6068(m), requiring a lawyer to respond promptly to reasonable status inquiries from a client; California Rules of Professional Conduct 3-700(D)(2), requiring a lawyer to promptly return unearned fees; and 3-110(a), prohibiting a lawyer from intentionally, recklessly, or repeatedly failing to perform legal services with competence.

652.html,12161,Mark Dynan,,Suspension,10/10/2004,,"Mark J. Dynan (WSBA No. 12161, admitted 1981), of Tacoma, was suspended for six months, effective October 10, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 1997 and 1999 involving alteration of bills and submission of false declarations in connection with motions for attorney fees. For additional information please see In re Discipline of Dynan, 152 Wn.2d 601, 98 P.3d 444 (2004).Mr. Dynan was hired by an insurance company in three matters to represent people insured by the company. By motion, Mr. Dynan requested attorney fees in each matter as authorized by statute and the Mandatory Arbitration Rules. The motions were supported by declarations of Mr. Dynan with attached billings. The declarations stated that the attached billings were â€œtrue and correct billings for my time and services expended on this matter.â€ However, the attached bills were not the actual bills sent to the insurance company. Believing that he was entitled by statute to claim a reasonable fee rather than his actual fee, Mr. Dynan had directed his office staff to white out the actual hourly rate of $100-$120 and replace it with a rate of $150 before submitting the papers to the court. Mr. Dynan did not notify the court or opposing counsel of these alterations.Mr. Dynanâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; 3.3(a)(4), prohibiting a lawyer from offering evidence the lawyer knows to be false; 3.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from falsifying evidence, counseling or assisting a witness to testify falsely, or offering an inducement to a witness that is prohibited by law; 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Douglas M.

653.html,12012,Gregory Wilson,,Resignation in Lieu of Disbarment,10/12/2004,,"Gregory S. Wilson (WSBA No. 12012, admitted 1981), of Tacoma, resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective October 12, 2004. This resignation was based on his conduct between 2002 and 2004 involving multiple acts of misconduct in immigration matters, failure to comply with duties on suspension, and practicing law while suspended. (Note: Mr. Wilson is to be distinguished from Gregory M. Wilson of Greenacres.)Matter 1: In February 2002, Mr. Wilson was hired to assist a client in obtaining permanent resident status for the client's family members. Mr. Wilson accepted over $3,000 as an advance cost deposit for the purpose of paying a $1,000-per-person INS penalty, which allows an eligible visa applicant to remain in the United States while a visa application is pending. Mr. Wilson was aware, however, that the family members were ineligible and would not soon become eligible, yet he failed to deposit the sum into a trust account. Mr. Wilson did not respond to repeated client telephone calls, and he failed to take action in the matter until November 2002, at which time he submitted a petition to the INS with an insufficient filing fee, which resulted in the petition being returned. The client requested a refund of the advance cost deposit, but Mr. Wilson failed to do so until a disciplinary investigation was underway.Matter 2: On March 21, 2003, a client hired Mr. Wilson after meeting with his paralegal and paying $500 for attorney fees. Mr. Wilson did not meet with the client and did not deposit the $500 into a trust account. Although on March 10, 2003, the Supreme Court had issued an order suspending Mr. Wilson from the practice of law for three months commencing April 1, 2003, the client was not informed of Mr. Wilson's imminent suspension, nor was the client informed of the suspension after it began. Mr. Wilson never met with the client, nor did he respond to the client's telephone calls. When the client visited Mr. Wilson's office, office staff advised the client that the matter would be continued and that the client did not need to appear for an April 9, 2003, pretrial hearing. Mr. Wilson did not, however, continue the matter, nor did he appear for the hearing. Owing to the client's failure to appear, a bench warrant was issued for the client's arrest. When the court clerk telephoned Mr. Wilson's office about the situation, a paralegal informed the clerk that another lawyer would be filing a notice of appearance in the matter. The clerk then informed the client that the other lawyer would be appearing for him. The client had never heard of the other lawyer and did not want the other lawyer to represent him. When the client called Mr. Wilson's office, Mr. Wilson did not return his call. The client resolved the case on his own. Despite the client's requests that he return the $500 advance fee deposit, Mr. Wilson did not do so.Matter 3: Mr. Wilson was hired to represent a Korean national whose passport, containing a student visa, had been stolen. Because the client did not make the necessary arrangements for his replacement passport to contain a visa, he was denied reentry to the United States after traveling to Canada. In June 2002, Mr. Wilson was paid $5,000 to undertake the representation, and he traveled to the U.S.-Canadian border to meet with the client and the border patrol. Thereafter Mr. Wilson asked for and was paid an additional $5,000, which was designated as refundable if Mr. Wilson was not successful in securing the client's re-entry into the United States. Mr. Wilson failed to appear at three scheduled meetings with the client and immigration officials, and he failed to return the client's telephone calls. The client was subsequently required to return to Korea to obtain a new visa. Although Mr. Wilson told the client that he would meet with him during a planned trip to Korea and assist in obtaining a new student visa, Mr. Wilson did not meet with the client during Mr. Wilson's stay in Korea. The client obtained and prepared the necessary documents on his own, eventually obtained a student visa, and returned to the United States. Mr. Wilson refunded $3,000 of the client's money between October 2002 and July 2003, but did not refund the remainder, together with interest, until after the client filed a grievance with the Bar Association.Matter 4: In 2002, a client hired Mr. Wilson to defend him in a lawsuit. Mr. Wilson and opposing counsel agreed to postpone a pending summary judgment motion until July 10, 2002, to give Mr. Wilson additional time to obtain needed declarations from the client and two witnesses. It was agreed that if the declarations raised sufficient factual issues, the motion would be stricken. At approximately 6:00 p.m. on July 9, 2002, Mr. Wilson's office faxed opposing counsel the client's signed declaration, along with a note indicating that Mr. Wilson would not be present for the motion hearing owing to another court appearance. The declaration was not filed or sent to the court, nor was a continuance sought. Because the declarations of the other witnesses had not been provided, opposing counsel proceeded with the motion. After considering the materials Mr. Wilson had faxed to opposing counsel, which opposing counsel provided to the judge during the hearing, the judge granted the motion and entered judgment against Mr. Wilson's client.Matter 5: After agreeing to a $50,000 settlement of her son's personal injury claim with an insurance company, a client hired Mr. Wilson to assist in obtaining court approval of the settlement, as required by court rule. In September 2002, Mr. Wilson arranged for the client and her son to meet with another lawyer, whom Mr. Wilson intended to name as the settlement guardian ad litem (GAL). Respondent took no action in the matter between the September 2002 meeting and March 31, 2003. On that date, one day before Mr. Wilson was to be suspended from the practice of law, Mr. Wilson filed an action to have the other lawyer appointed as the settlement GAL and for approval of the settlement. Mr. Wilson remained counsel of record in the matter until February 2004, but he took no further action on the client's behalf.Matter 6: A Korean citizen hired Mr. Wilson to assist her in completing her pending application for adjustment in status to resident alien. The immigration court had previously ordered the client removed without having issued proper notice. On December 18, 2002, Mr. Wilson filed a motion to reopen the proceedings. On January 3, 2003, the immigration court issued an order noting that Mr. Wilson's motion was not in compliance with immigration court procedures; it ordered Mr. Wilson to file certain forms by April 1, 2003, and set a hearing for July 3, 2003. Mr. Wilson did not notify the client or the immigration court of his imminent suspension from the practice of law, scheduled to commence on April 1, 2003. On the date his suspension took effect, Mr. Wilson filed additional noncompliant papers with the court. On April 8, 2003, the immigration court issued an order extending the deadline for 10 days; the order warned that failure to file the necessary papers would lead to entry of an order of abandonment and voluntary departure without further warning. Mr. Wilson did not respond to the order. On April 28, 2003, the immigration court granted voluntary departure until June 20, 2003, with an alternative order of removal. Mr. Wilson did not forward the order to the client. The client unsuccessfully attempted to contact Mr. Wilson about the July hearing; the client only learned of Mr. Wilson's suspension when a relative contacted the Bar Association for assistance in communicating with Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson subsequently filed an untimely appeal of the order, which was dismissed. He also filed an untimely motion for reconsideration, which was dismissed. The client was detained by immigration authorities in January 2004, but was released on humanitarian grounds to allow her to care for her ailing veteran husband after a congressman intervened on her behalf. The client subsequently hired new counsel, who successfully moved to reopen the proceeding based on ineffective assistance of counsel.Matter 7: During the period of his three-month suspension, in three matters Mr. Wilson failed to notify clients of his suspension and he practiced law while suspended and/or allowed his legal assistants to take action on the client's behalf. In 19 cases in which Mr. Wilson was counsel of record, although no other lawyer substituted for his clients, Mr. Wilson failed to notify the court of his inability to act as required by the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct. In at least four matters in addition to Matter 2 (above), Mr. Wilson arranged for another lawyer to substitute for him during the period of his suspension without obtaining his client's consent.Mr. Wilson's conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions concerning the representation; RPC 1.5(a), requiring that a lawyer's fee be reasonable; RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client, a third person, or the lawyer's own interests; RPC 1.14(a), requiring a lawyer to deposit all funds of a client into an interest-bearing trust account; RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver as requested by the client any funds or properties in the possession of the lawyer that the client is entitled to receive; RPC 1.15(a)(1), requiring a lawyer to terminate a representation if the representation will result in violation of the Rules for Professional Conduct or other law; RPC 5.3, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the conduct of nonlawyer assistants is compatible with the lawyer's ethical obligations; RPC 5.5(a), prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law; RPC 5.5(e), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in the practice of law while on inactive status or while suspended; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; RPC 8.4(j), prohibiting willful disobedience or violation of a court order; ELC 14.1(c), requiring a suspended lawyer to notify clients, tribunals, and adverse counsel of the lawyer's inability to act; and ELC 14.2, requiring a disbarred or suspended lawyer to discontinue the practice of law.Anne I.

658.html,24641,Antony Deruiz,,Suspension,10/21/2004,,"Antony P. Deruiz (WSBA No. 24641, admitted 1995), of Edmonds, was ordered to serve two consecutive six-month suspensions, effective October 21, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following hearings in two matters. The matters were consolidated on appeal. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2000 and 2002 involving neglect of client cases, failure to communicate with clients, failure to refund unreasonable and unearned fees, and failure to cooperate with disciplinary investigations. For additional information please see In re Discipline of Deruiz, 152 Wn.2d 558, 99 P.3d 881 (2004).Matter 1: This matter comprises misconduct in two client matters, together with failure to cooperate with the disciplinary investigations of both matters. â€¢  In June 2001, Client A's mother paid Mr. Deruiz $1,500 to represent the client at a probation review hearing. After advising the client that a hearing date would be set soon, Mr. Deruiz did not further write or speak to the client, despite the client's efforts to contact him. The client telephoned the court and learned that a hearing date had not been set. Mr. Deruiz scheduled the hearing shortly thereafter. When the client's mother telephoned Mr. Deruiz to inquire about the hearing date, Mr. Deruiz was upset and threatened to terminate the representation because the client had contacted the court. After indicating the hearing was scheduled for July 9, Mr. Deruiz ended the call. He had no further contact with the client or the client's mother. On July 9, the court canceled the hearing because Mr. Deruiz had not appeared and had not arranged for the client to be transported from the correctional facility. Mr. Deruiz did not respond to the client's mother's inquiries about why he had failed to appear nor to her requests that he refund the $1,500. Mr. Deruiz did not withdraw as counsel of record. The client's mother eventually obtained a civil default judgment against Mr. Deruiz in the amount of $1,590.â€¢ During the course of the WSBA disciplinary investigation of the Client A matter, Mr. Deruiz failed to submit a timely response to a request for a response, failed to appear for a deposition as required by subpoena, terminated a deposition in order to consult with counsel, and failed to appear for the rescheduled deposition.â€¢ In November 2000, Client B hired Mr. Deruiz to appeal the Department of Licensing's revocation of his driver's license. Client B paid Mr. Deruiz $1,000 of the agreed $2,000 fee. Months passed without Mr. Deruiz providing the client with any information on the status of the case. During this period, the client's employment as a commercial truck driver was terminated because the client lacked information on the status of his license. The client repeatedly attempted to contact Mr. Deruiz, without success. Mr. Deruiz did not respond to the client's requests for information about the status of the appeal, for an accounting, and for a return of unearned fees.â€¢ During the course of the disciplinary investigation of the Client B matter, Mr. Deruiz failed to respond to a request for information and declined to appear at a deposition as required by subpoena. The WSBA served him with a petition for interim suspension for failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation, together with an order to show cause, to which he did not respond. The Supreme Court granted the petition for an interim suspension, which remained in effect until Mr. Deruiz attended a deposition and provided the WSBA with the requested materials.Matter 2: Client C hired Mr. Deruiz to represent him on a charge of driving under the influence in Grant County and another driving-under-the-influence case in Kittitas County. The client paid both fees in part, and it was agreed that the remainder of the two fee arrangements could be paid in installments of $100 per month. Mr. Deruiz failed to attend a January 22 hearing in Grant County, claiming he was unable to successfully travel over Snoqualmie Pass, although the client and the judge had both successfully navigated the pass to attend the hearing. The court continued the hearing to February 19. On February 16, Mr. Deruiz appeared in court with the client in Kittitas County. Because the client was behind on his February payment, Mr. Deruiz warned him that a failure to pay would result in Mr. Deruiz's withdrawal. The client assured him that a check was in the mail.On February 19, Mr. Deruiz failed to appear for the Grant County hearing; he did not contact the court, the prosecutor, or the client regarding his failure to appear. Subsequently, he received notice from the prosecuting attorney and the court that the hearing was rescheduled to February 25, but Mr. Deruiz failed to appear on that date or to contact the parties or the court. The court again rescheduled the hearing for March 12 and notified Mr. Deruiz of its understanding that he was counsel in the matter. Mr. Deruiz again failed to appear. Although Mr. Deruiz had not formally withdrawn from the matter, the court assigned Client C a public defender. Despite numerous attempts, the client was unable to contact Mr. Deruiz about the situation.During the disciplinary investigation of the Client C matter, Mr. Deruiz proffered a number of reasons for his failures to appear, which explanations were inconsistent with his later testimony at the disciplinary hearing. Mr. Deruiz's explanations for his failures to appear were found to be not credible.Mr. Deruiz's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions; RPC 1.5(a), requiring that a lawyer's fee be reasonable; RPC 1.5(b), requiring that upon client request a lawyer shall communicate in writing the basis or rate of a fee; RPC 1.15(d), requiring that a lawyer take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests upon termination of representation, including refunding any advance fee payment that has not been earned; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and former RLD 2.8(a), requiring a lawyer to promptly furnish a full and complete response to any inquiry or request made in connection with a grievance or disciplinary investigation.Kevin M. Bank, Tracy B. Calabrese, Marsha A. Matsumoto, and Rebecca A. Neal represented the Bar Association. Mr. Deruiz represented himself. Robert C. Bibb and Moses F.

659.html,23210,Anthony Szabo,,Reprimand,10/15/2004,,"Anthony Z. Szabo (WSBA No. 23210, admitted 1993), of Kent, was ordered to receive a reprimand, effective October 15, 2004, following a stipulation. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2002, involving the failure to deposit client funds in a trust account and failure to keep complete records of client funds.In 2002, a client consulted with Mr. Szabo about a potential medical malpractice claim. Mr. Szabo agreed to evaluate the case. After receiving the medical reports, Mr. Szabo advised the client that before he would agree to handle the case, he would need her to advance $450 in costs for the hiring of a medical expert to review the reports. In August 2002, Mr. Szabo charged the sum to the clientâ€™s credit card and directed the funds to his general banking account. Believing that the funds would be immediately paid to the medical expert, Mr. Szabo did not transfer the funds into a trust account. It eventuated that there were delays in obtaining the expertâ€™s services, but Mr. Szabo did not transfer the clientâ€™s funds to his trust account.A physician reviewed the medical reports in September 2002 and reported that he was not inclined to express an opinion in the matter. The physician did not charge for the consultation. In October 2002, Mr. Szabo advised the client that he was declining to handle her case, and refunded $450 to the clientâ€™s credit-card account. During the period between August and October 2002, during which the clientâ€™s funds were in Mr. Szaboâ€™s general account, Mr. Szabo did not maintain at least a $450 balance in the account in order to preserve the integrity of the clientâ€™s funds.Mr. Szaboâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.14(a), requiring a lawyer to deposit all funds of a client into an interest-bearing trust account; and 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds or other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer.Randy Beitel represented the Bar Association.

66.html,17470,Kelly Seidlitz,,Disbarment,6/1/2000,,"Kelly Seidlitz (WSBA No. 17470, admitted 1987), of Tacoma, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective June 1, 2000, following a hearing. The discipline is based upon his failure to preserve client funds, committing criminal acts that reflect adversely on his fitness as a lawyer, and failure to diligently represent and communicate with several clients.Matter 1: Mr. Seidlitz represented a mother and her two minor children regarding injuries from an automobile collision. In June 1994, with the motherâ€™s permission, Mr. Seidlitz settled the childrenâ€™s claims. Court rules require that minorsâ€™ settlement funds are deposited into the court registry, and that a petition be filed for court approval of the settlement. Mr. Seidlitz left the checks in his client file and did not deposit them in the court registry. In November 1994, a doctor who had treated the children learned of the settlement payments and contacted Mr. Seidlitz. The insurance company canceled the first checks and issued new checks that included the doctor as a payee. On January 12, 1995, the doctor endorsed the checks and returned them to Mr. Seidlitz. On January 27, 1995, Mr. Seidlitz filed the required petition asking the court to approve the minorsâ€™ settlement. He obtained a final order on March 22, 1995 and disbursed the checks on April 11, 1995. The mother contacted Mr. Seidlitz for information regarding the case from June 1994 through February 1995, but he did not return her calls. In October 1994, the client promptly answered interrogatories and returned them to Mr. Seidlitz. He did not serve them on the insurance company until January 1995.Matter 2: In February 1995, Mr. Seidlitz agreed to represent the husband in an uncontested dissolution action. He filed the petition for dissolution and the wife accepted service and joined in the petition. The client met Mr. Seidlitz for the first time on July 3, 1995, in court, for the presentation of the final pleadings. The commissioner refused to sign the pleadings because the wifeâ€™s signature did not appear on the child support order and worksheet. The commissioner took the required testimonial proof and indicated to Mr. Seidlitz that he would sign the pleadings without further appearance by either party when the wife signed the child support order and worksheet. On July 3, 1995, the client moved out of state, leaving a new address and telephone number with Mr. Seidlitz. The wife signed these pleadings the next week. Mr. Seidlitz did not contact the client after his move. Mr. Seidlitz rescheduled the presentation of final documents for July 31, 1995. The wife appeared in court, but Mr. Seidlitz did not. On December 18, 1995, Mr. Seidlitzâ€™s client drove from Texas to Mr. Seidlitzâ€™s office, which was closed during normal business hours. The client retained new counsel who redrafted the dissolution pleadings and entered them with the court on December 28, 1995.Matter 3: In August 1994, a daughter met with a Spanish-speaking, nonlawyer legal assistant (assistant) who worked with Mr. Seidlitz. The daughter contacted Mr. Seidlitzâ€™s firm because she was told that the office understood Spanish. The daughter asked that Mr. Seidlitz assist her parents, Mexican citizens, in becoming residents of the United States. The assistant did not tell the parents that the fee was non-refundable. The parents paid Mr. Seidlitz $500 for each parentâ€™s representation. The father did not sign a written fee agreement. Although the mother signed a written fee agreement, it was in English, and she did not read or speak English. Mr. Seidlitzâ€™s office accompanied the father to get two passport photos, but took no other actions on either case. In October 1994, the assistant requested that the parents make an additional payment, which they refused to make until some work was performed. On February 3, 1996, Mr. Seidlitz told the parents that the assistant had been terminated, he could not locate any of their paperwork, and he had no record of any payments. He refused to refund their $1,000 payment. Mr. Seidlitz never located the parentsâ€™ original immigration documents.Matter 4: Mr. Seidlitz represented the wife in a dissolution. The parties settled the case on September 12, 1996, and the court entered the decree that day. The decree provided that the client would receive an annuity payment beginning October 1, 1998. On September 16, 1996, opposing counsel sent Mr. Seidlitz a supplement to the decree to allow the payments to begin. Mr. Seidlitz did not obtain his clientâ€™s signature on the pleading. The decree also provided that the husband would deliver the wifeâ€™s personal property to his lawyer, and that if the wife had not picked up the property within seven days after notice, she would forfeit the items. Mr. Seidlitz received opposing counsel letter notifying him of the property delivery on September 20, 1996, but Mr. Seidlitz did not notify his client. On October 7, 1996, opposing counsel notified Mr. Seidlitzâ€™s office that the property had been returned to the husband and that it belonged to the husband. About October 12, 1996, Mr. Seidlitzâ€™s office staff told his client that Mr. Seidlitz had been notified about the property but had failed to notify her, and that the property items had been returned to the husband. Mr. Seidlitz did not explain to the client that his failure to protect her property may have created a conflict of interest between the client and himself.Matter 5: On April 25, 1997, Mr. Seidlitz agreed to represent the husband in a dissolution action. A motion for temporary orders was scheduled for April 28, 1997. Mr. Seidlitz filed a notice of appearance the next day, and opposing counsel agreed to continue the hearing. From April to mid-June, the client called to determine the status of the temporary orders. Opposing counsel rescheduled the hearing for June 2, 1997. Mr. Seidlitz received notice, but did not notify his client, file paperwork or attend the hearing. At the hearing, the court granted the wife temporary primary residential care of their daughter. On June 3, 1997, opposing counsel sent Mr. Seidlitz a copy of the temporary order. Mr. Seidlitz did not send a copy to his client. In mid-June, the client learned of the order from his wife and requested that Mr. Seidlitz withdraw from the case and refund the clientâ€™s $1,000 retainer. Mr. Seidlitz did not withdraw from the case or refund the clientâ€™s money. Mr. Seidlitz did not communicate with the client after this and took no further action on the case, except to file a response to the petition after receiving a motion for default. The client settled the case on his own in March 1998. The client had to demonstrate that Mr. Seidlitz refused to withdraw from the case before the court would allow the agreed settlement to be entered.Matter 6: On June 11, 1996, Mr. Seidlitz settled a personal injury case for a client. On June 17, 1996, the insurance company lawyer mailed Mr. Seidlitz three checks or warrants totaling $25,000 and a release. One of the checks was payable to the client, Mr. Seidlitz and a doctor who had treated the client. The doctorâ€™s bill equaled approximately the amount of the check, and he had filed a lien against the settlement. Mr. Seidlitz deposited the check into his bank account without the doctorâ€™s permission or endorsement, and did not pay the doctorâ€™s bill. In late August 1996, the doctor learned of the settlement and hired a lawyer to contact Mr. Seidlitz. On September 4, 1996, Mr. Seidlitz issued a check to the doctor for a portion of the amount of the bill, but did not pay the remaining portion of the bill. On October 16, 1997, the bank paid the doctor the remaining portion of the bill because it accepted the check for deposit without the doctorâ€™s endorsement.Matter 7: Mr. Seidlitz represented three clients who were injured in an April 1996 automobile accident. In July 1996, Mr. Seidlitz settled the claims. One claim was settled for $7,261, even though the client did not consent to settle for less than $7,500. In late November 1996, Mr. Seidlitz sent the clients their settlement statements, which listed holdbacks for bills that the clients did not owe and that Mr. Seidlitz did not pay. The clients never received the held monies. In December 1996, the clients faxed Mr. Seidlitz a letter detailing mistakes they believed were in the settlement statements and listing the amounts they expected to receive. Mr. Seidlitz did not respond to the letter and paid himself in December 1996. Mr. Seidlitz sent the clients their portions of the settlement in January 1997. The clients again disputed the amounts they received. Mr. Seidlitz did not respond.Matter 8: Mr. Seidlitz settled a clientâ€™s personal injury claim for $11,000. The insurance company issued a check on March 25, 1998 payable jointly to the client, Mr. Seidlitz and a doctor. Mr. Seidlitz deposited the check without the doctorâ€™s endorsement or permission. On April 2, 1998, Mr. Seidlitz had the client sign a handwritten disbursal statement that included a $3,796 holdback for the doctor, which Mr. Seidlitz never paid. The client tried to discuss the bill with Mr. Seidlitz from April 1998 through September 1998, but Mr. Seidlitz did not return the clientâ€™s calls.Matter 9: Mr. Seidlitz settled a clientâ€™s personal injury claim for $20,000. The check was made out to the client, Mr. Seidlitz and a doctor. Mr. Seidlitz deposited the check without the doctorâ€™s permission or endorsement. Mr. Seidlitz disbursed some of the money to the client without a settlement statement. Mr. Seidlitz did not pay the $1,200 in medical bills. The client paid the medical bills and then asked that Mr. Seidlitz pay her $1,200 more from the settlement funds. Mr. Seidlitz did not communicate with the client, but sent her $807.50 with no explanation.Matter 10: On February 25, 1997, Mr. Seidlitz settled a personal injury claim for a father and his minor son. He sent the clients a release and told them that when the insurance company received the signed releases, they would send the settlement checks. The clients signed and returned the releases, but never heard from Mr. Seidlitz. Unbeknownst to the clients, Mr. Seidlitz received the checks. The checks were made out to Mr. Seidlitz and the clients. The checks were deposited into Mr. Seidlitzâ€™s bank account with the clientsâ€™ names written on the back. In October 1997, the clients learned from the insurance company that the money had been sent to Mr. Seidlitz. After several phone calls and letters from the clients and the Bar Association, Mr. Seidlitz sent the clients two checks and a settlement statement. The settlement statement indicated a $2,476 holdback for a doctorâ€™s bill. Mr. Seidlitz did not pay the doctorâ€™s bill.Matter 11: On June 6, 1997, the Supreme Court notified Mr. Seidlitz that his license to practice law was suspended for failure to pay his Bar Association dues. The Office of Disciplinary Counsel also sent Mr. Seidlitz a letter regarding his suspension. Mr. Seidlitz received both notices. Mr. Seidlitz sat as a pro tem Pierce County District Court judge on eight occasions prior to reinstating his license on June 24, 1997. RCW 3.34.060(a) and 3.34.130(1) require that a person must either be elected to serve as a district court judge or be a lawyer admitted to practice in the state of Washington to be eligible to serve as a pro tem judge.Matter 12: A client not fluent in English retained Mr. Seidlitz to collect a past due $10,000 loan. Mr. Seidlitz agreed to a $1,500 fee to be paid in installments. He wrote three one-page letters in August and October 1994, and did no other work on the clientâ€™s case. The client paid Mr. Seidlitz $750. When the client determined that Mr. Seidlitz had only written three letters, he requested a refund, which Mr. Seidlitz did not provide.Matter 13: Mr. Seidlitz failed to respond to Disciplinary Counselâ€™s requests to respond to these grievances. Additionally, he failed to appear for a scheduled audit. Mr. Seidlitz also failed to respond to appear for a deposition, after being served with a subpoena.Mr. Seidlitzâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent clients; RPC 1.4(a), requiring lawyers to keep clients informed of the status of their cases and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.14, for failing to properly preserve clients property by depositing client funds into a trust account and keeping records of all transactions; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; RPC 5.3, requiring lawyers to adequately supervise nonlawyer assistants; RPC 1.1, requiring lawyers to provide competent representation; RPC 1.7, prohibiting representing a client if the representation will be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests; RPC 1.15, requiring lawyers to protect a clientâ€™s interests when withdrawing from representation; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects (theft); RPC 1.2(a), requiring lawyers to abide by a clientâ€™s decision whether to settle a case; and RLD 2.8, requiring lawyers to cooperate with Bar Association requests for information regarding grievances or other matters under investigation.Joy McLean represented the Bar Association.

660.html,388,William Beresford,,Resignation in Lieu of Disbarment,11/9/2004,,"William Beresford (WSBA No. 388, admitted 1968), of Edmonds, resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective November 9, 2004. This resignation was based on his conduct in failing to keep a client adequately informed about the status of a matter, failing to comply with trust-accounting rules, intentionally misappropriating client funds, making false and misleading statements in connection with a disciplinary investigation, and testifying falsely in a disciplinary deposition. (Note: Mr. Beresford is to be distinguished from Robert O. Beresford, deceased, and Richard R. Beresford, of Edmonds.)In 1995, Mr. Beresford represented a client seeking to obtain payment for work performed as a subcontractor. In 1996 Mr. Beresford obtained a stipulated judgment in the client's favor for $10,000 plus interest. The defendant did not pay the judgment in a timely fashion, and Mr. Beresford assisted the client in attempting to collect the judgment. Between 1996 and October 1999, the defendant made a number of payments on the judgment, which Mr. Beresford and/or his firm properly paid to the client.In October 1999, the defendant gave Mr. Beresford two $5,000 checks made payable to Mr. Beresford. Mr. Beresford did not notify the client of the receipt of the funds. Mr. Beresford endorsed both checks, depositing some of the proceeds into his own personal bank account and taking the remainder in cash. Without the client's knowledge or authorization, Mr. Beresford intentionally misappropriated all the money for his own purposes. In December 2000, Mr. Beresford purchased and delivered to the client a $2,500 cashier's check payable to the client. The client subsequently asked Mr. Beresford to represent him in collecting payment on another matter. The client came to believe that Mr. Beresford was not handling the matter diligently, and requested information about the case. Mr. Beresford did not respond to the requests. In 2002, the client repeatedly wrote to Mr. Beresford, stating that he had hired another lawyer in both matters and asking Mr. Beresford to provide him with both files and an accounting in the first matter. Mr. Beresford did not respond to these requests until he was contacted by the WSBA, at which time he turned over the files to the client. He did not, however, provide the client with an accounting.In February 2003, the lawyer for the defendant in the first matter requested that Mr. Beresford provide a satisfaction of judgment for the defendant's payment of the judgment amount. Mr. Beresford responded that he no longer represented the client and that the defendant knew the judgment had not been fully paid. He later indicated that he did not want to take the time to do all the arithmetic to determine whether the judgment had been paid off.In March 2003 and again in May 2003, the client requested an accounting. Mr. Beresford did not provide the requested accounting.The client filed a grievance with the WSBA in August 2003. In his written responses to the grievance and to requests for information in connection with the investigation, as well as during an investigatory deposition, Mr. Beresford, in an effort to prevent discovery of his misappropriations, intentionally made false and/or misleading statements regarding his handling of the funds and the payment of funds to the client.In connection with his resignation in lieu of disbarment, Mr. Beresford paid restitution to the former client.Mr. Beresford's conduct violated RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions; RPC 1.14(a), requiring a lawyer to deposit funds belonging to a client into an identifiable interest-bearing trust account; RPC 1.14(b)(1), requiring a lawyer to promptly notify a client of the receipt of client funds; RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by the client funds in the lawyer's possession that the client is entitled to receive; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; and ELC 5.3(e)(1), requiring a lawyer to promptly respond to any inquiry or request made under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct and to provide a full and complete response to inquiries and questions.Jean K.

VanDerbeek (WSBA No. 11884, admitted 1981), of Mercer Island, was disbarred, effective November 24, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on her conduct over an extended period of time in the 1990s involving a pattern of billing misconduct. For additional information, see In re Discipline of VanDerbeek, 153 Wn.2d 64, 98 P.3d 444 (2004).Ms. VanDerbeek opened a solo practice in family law in 1986. Her husband, who has a J.D. degree but never took the bar examination, managed her practiceâ€™s bookkeeping and accounting. In 1995, 28 former clients sued the VanDerbeeks for charging excessive fees. Ms. VanDerbeek signed a declaration in June 1996 declaring that she was in the process of changing her billing software to remedy client complaints about her billing practices. The lawsuit settled in 1996. Ms. VanDerbeek did not change her billing software until May 2000.During the time period at issue, Ms. VanDerbeek engaged in the following conduct that established grounds for discipline:â€¢ Intentionally charging excessive and unreasonable fees to 11 clients;â€¢ Billing seven clients for attorney fees and costs incurred in attempting to collect the clientsâ€™ outstanding fees, where the fee agreement did not authorize her to charge for such activities;â€¢ Recording attorney liens on the proceeds of the sales of real property owned by three clients in an attempt to coerce the clients into paying disputed fees, and charging those clients for fees and costs incurred in connection with placing the liens;â€¢ Refusing to provide clients with itemized bills upon request and failing to keep back-up documentation in order to properly respond to such requests;â€¢ Failing to supervise her firmâ€™s nonlawyer bookkeeper/accountant to ensure that his billing practices, which included adding charges to client bills without explanation and billing legal assistant time at Ms. VanDerbeekâ€™s rate, did not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct.Ms. VanDerbeekâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.5(a), requiring that a lawyerâ€™s fee be reasonable; RPC 5.3(a), requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that the conduct of nonlawyer employees or assistants is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; RPC 5.3(b), requiring a lawyer with direct supervisory authority over a nonlawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the nonlawyerâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Jonathan H.

Krishan Kumar (WSBA No. 26511, admitted 1996), of Jaipur, India, was disbarred, effective November 30, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2002 and 2003 involving the submission of false material information on applications for admission to the Hawaii State Bar Association and the Law Society of British Columbia, failure to notify the Washington State Bar Association that he had changed his legal name, and failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation. (Mr. White is to be distinguished from Paul Joseph White of Golden, Paul R. White of Ephrata, and Paul S. White of Spokane.)Mr. White, then named Krishan Kumar, was admitted to practice law in India in May 1992. He unsuccessfully applied for admission to the State Bar of California six times between 1993 and 1996. He was admitted to practice law in the state of Washington in December 1996 under the name Krishan Kumar. Between 1997 and 2003, he maintained an office and practiced law in Seattle.In April 2001, identifying himself as a King County resident, he changed his name to Paul White in King County District Court. In May 2001, Mr. White changed his membership record with the Washington State Bar Association to reflect his new name.In June 2001, Mr. White was suspended from the practice of law in the state of Washington for 30 days for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.In January 2002, Mr. White submitted an application for enrollment in the Law Society of British Columbia using the name Krishan Kumar. Although declaring under oath that the information in the application was true, accurate, and complete, Mr. White omitted material facts in responding to questions concerning changes of name and use of other names, other admissions, and prior residences and employment. Specifically, he did not disclose his use of the name Paul White, his membership in the Washington State Bar Association, or his employment or residence in Washington. Mr. White withdrew his application after the Law Society of British Columbia instituted a character and fitness hearing based on the omitted information.In July 2002, Mr. White submitted an application for admission to the Hawaii State Bar Association using the name Krishan Kumar. Although representing that he had answered all questions candidly, fully, frankly, and truthfully, and that the answers were complete and to the best of his knowledge, Mr. White omitted material facts in responding to questions concerning use of other names, admissions in other jurisdictions, membership in other bar associations, applications made in other jurisdictions, prior discipline, prior employment, and prior residences. Specifically, he did not disclose his use of the name Paul White, his admission to practice in Washington, his membership in the Washington State Bar Association, his applications for admission in California and Washington, his 30-day disciplinary suspension in Washington, or his employment or residence in Washington. (In October 2002, Mr. White amended his answers to indicate that he had applied for admission in â€œCalifornia/Washingtonâ€ in â€œ1993/1994â€ but was not admitted because he failed the bar examination.) In January 2003, Mr. White withdrew his application after the Hawaii Board of Examiners questioned the veracity of his application.In March 2003, Mr. White changed his name back to Krishan Kumar in King County District Court. In July 2003, the Washington State Bar Association opened a grievance to investigate Mr. Whiteâ€™s statements in connection with his applications for admission in other jurisdictions. Between July and October 2003, disciplinary counsel endeavored to obtain Mr. Whiteâ€™s response to the grievance. Although Mr. White notified the Bar Association that he had returned permanently to India, he did not designate a resident agent for service as required by APR 5(e), nor did he respond to the grievance.Mr. Whiteâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.1, prohibiting a lawyer in connection with a bar admission application from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or failing to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known to have arisen in the matter; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting commission of a criminal act (namely, false swearing) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; RPC 8.4(n), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law; and ELC 5.3(e), requiring a lawyer to promptly respond to any inquiry or discovery request made in connection with a disciplinary investigation.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

663.html,27574,Oleg Ordinartsev,,Suspension,11/29/2004,,"Oleg Ordinartsev (WSBA No. 27574, admitted 1997), of Bothell, was suspended for two years, effective November 29, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2001 and 2003 involving a number of conflicts of interest, the improper disbursement of client funds, improperly attempting to settle a claim for malpractice liability with an unrepresented client, and the inclusion of a false statement in a promissory note.Prior to 2001, Mr. Ordinartsev represented Client A in a number of matters. In October 2001, Mr. Ordinartsev began representing Client B in connection with a caviar production and distribution business known as the â€œcaviar project,â€ which involved several corporate entities. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Ordinartsev stopped taking new clients and commenced work as legal counsel for the caviar project, though he retained some of his existing clients, including Client A.Meanwhile, Mr. Ordinartsev began to discuss the possibility of Client A investing in the caviar project. Mr. Ordinartsev failed to fully advise Client A of all the conflicts inhering in his advice to invest in the business of another client (including the fact that the business employed Mr. Ordinartsev). Mr. Ordinartsev did not obtain written waivers of the conflict from either client.In March 2002, Client A gave Mr. Ordinartsev $65,000 to invest in the caviar project, expecting to receive stock in one of the caviar projectâ€™s corporations. Mr. Ordinartsev deposited the funds into his trust account. Mr. Ordinartsev subsequently disbursed $20,000 to Client B, $20,000 to himself for legal services related to the caviar project, and $25,000 to one of the projectâ€™s corporate entities. At the time, Mr. Ordinartsev knew that this use of the funds was inconsistent with the expectations of Client A. Mr. Ordinartsev failed to provide adequate documentation or obtain any security in connection with his use of the funds.A number of corporate permutations ensued in connection with the caviar project, during which Mr. Ordinartsev acquired an ownership interest in one of the entities. During this period, Mr. Ordinartsev showcased for Client A the projectâ€™s production plant in an attempt to assuage Client Aâ€™s concerns about the investment. He also unsuccessfully endeavored to obtain from Client B a corporate resolution from the then operational corporate entity acknowledging that Client A had made a $55,000 capital contribution.Subsequently, pursuant to Client Aâ€™s demand, Mr. Ordinartsev prepared a promissory note for the repayment of the money. In the note, Mr. Ordinartsev also agreed to pursue legal action against Client B to recover the money. The note also falsely stated that Mr. Ordinartsev did not personally benefit from his disbursal of Clients Aâ€™s funds.Client A later rejected Mr. Ordinartsevâ€™s promissory note and instead sought Mr. Ordinartsevâ€™s ownership interest in the caviar project. Mr. Ordinartsev agreed to transfer his interest to Client A, and he drafted a settlement agreement to this effect. The agreement included a provision in which Client A abandoned any and all claims against Mr. Ordinartsev. Mr. Ordinartsev failed to advise Client A to consult with independent counsel about the agreement.Mr. Ordinartsevâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.2, requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objective of representation; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client; RPC 1.7(a) and (b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client will be directly adverse to another client, or if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to another client or the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after a full disclosure; RPC 1.8(h), which prohibits a lawyer from settling a claim for malpractice with an unrepresented client without first advising that person in writing that independent representation is appropriate; RPC 8.4(a), prohibiting attempts to violate the RPCs (here, by means of violating RPC 1.9, prohibiting undertaking a representation in conflict with the interests for a former client); and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Jean K.

This discipline was based on Mr. Hayesâ€™ disclosure of confidential client information and use of confidential client information to the disadvantage of a former client without consent. In 2001, Mr. Hayes was hired by the beneficiaries of an estate to probate a will. One of the beneficiaries subsequently hired another lawyer in the matter. Without client consent, Mr. Hayes told a funeral home that the beneficiary had received life insurance proceeds sufficient to pay the decedentâ€™s funeral expenses. Following his withdrawal, without obtaining the former clientâ€™s consent, Mr. Hayes represented an assisted living facility in preparing a creditorâ€™s claim against the estate, and he contacted a banking institution to ensure that the bank had filed a claim against the estate. Mr. Hayesâ€™s conduct did not result in client harm.Mr. Hayesâ€™ conduct violated ER 1.6(a) of the Arizona Rules of Professional Conduct, prohibiting a lawyer from revealing information relating to representation of a client unless the client consents after consultation, and ER 1.9(a), prohibiting a lawyer from using information relating to the representation to the disadvantage of a former client except as ER 1.6 would permit with respect to a client or when the information has become generally known.

Brendgard (WSBA No. 21254, admitted 1991), of Everett, was ordered to receive a reprimand, effective November 19, 2004, following a stipulation approved by the hearing officer. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2002 and 2003 in failing to act with reasonable diligence and promptness, failing to communicate with the client, failing to pursue the clientâ€™s objectives, and failing to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation.In June 2002, Mr. Brendgard was hired to obtain post-dissolution financial relief against a clientâ€™s former spouse. In August 2002, when the client contacted Mr. Brendgard to inquire about progress on the matter, Mr. Brendgard assured her that he would present her claims and provide her with copies of the papers, but he failed to do so. In late August 2002, the clientâ€™s former spouse filed a motion for contempt, alleging that the client had failed to comply with a parenting plan. Mr. Brendgard represented the client at a hearing on the motion in September 2002, after which the court found the client in contempt and assessed $500 in attorney fees against her. Although Mr. Brendgard telephoned the client shortly thereafter, he failed to inform her that she had been found in contempt or that costs had been assessed against her.In January 2003, the clientâ€™s former spouse filed a second motion for contempt, and the matter was scheduled for hearing on January 27. Although the client attempted to communicate with Mr. Brendgard before the hearing, he did not respond to her inquiries until January 31. Meanwhile, Mr. Brendgard obtained a continuance to acquire information from the client. At a hearing on February 6, the court again found the client in contempt and assessed $1,000 in attorney fees against her. Mr. Brendgard failed to inform the client of the outcome. For several months following the hearing, the client attempted to contact Mr. Brendgard, to no avail.In April 2003, the client reached Mr. Brendgard by telephone. He informed her that he had moved and that her documents and information must have become lost. He assured her that he would contact her the next day about them. After that conversation, Mr. Brendgard had no further communication with the client. He did not send her any information or inform her of the result of the February 6 hearing. He did not commence action on the clientâ€™s post-dissolution claims, nor did he refund the fee the client had paid. He filed a notice of intent to withdraw from the case in November 2003.Mr. Brendgardâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.2, requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client.Natalea Skvir represented the Bar Association.

While undergoing the background check, Mr. Nolte falsely answered one of the questions on a background questionnaire and failed to make full disclosure about another matter to the special agents with whom he interviewed.Mr. Nolte afterwards voluntarily disclosed these actions to senior Air Force personnel. Following an investigation, Mr. Nolte received a nonjudicial punishment in the form of a reprimand and a $1,000 fine. He was subsequently advised that his service with the Air Force would be terminated. Mr. Nolte submitted his resignation, and he was ultimately discharged â€œunder honorable conditions.â€ He was required to repay over $20,000 in educational benefits received during his last years of service.Mr. Nolteâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Linda B.

The discipline is based upon his failure to diligently represent a client, and willful disobedience of a court order.In January 1993, Mr. Lopez agreed to represent a client who had been injured on a Metro bus in 1991. Mr. Lopez determined that the settlement offered by Metro was insufficient and filed a notice of claim with King County on November 17, 1994. Mr. Lopez failed to commence the action within the three-year statute of limitations. Mr. Lopez met with the client after the statute expired and explained that the claim was lost because he had not filed the lawsuit. Mr. Lopez also advised the client that she could seek independent counsel to consider her options.On September 7, 1995, the client filed a malpractice action against Mr. Lopez. On November 15, 1996, the parties put the terms of a $15,000 settlement on the record. The terms required Mr. Lopez to pay $5,000 initially, and then make month-ly payments. Mr. Lopez also agreed to satisfy all medical liens, and the settlement was secured by a deed of trust on Mr. Lopezâ€™s real property and an interest in his 1986 Porsche. Mr. Lopez made the initial $5,000 payment, but failed to make any monthly payments or provide evidence that the medical liens were satisfied. When the clientâ€™s malpractice lawyer investigated collecting the judgment, she determined that Mr. Lopez had sold the Porsche.On June 24, 1999, the court found Mr. Lopez in contempt for failing to comply with the court order regarding payments and for selling the Porsche. The court ordered Mr. Lopez to purge the contempt by paying the client the $2,500 he made on the Porsche, in three monthly installments. Mr. Lopez failed to make these payments, and on October 22, 1999, the court issued a bench warrant for his arrest. In March 2000, Mr. Lopez satisfied the judgment in full.Mr. Lopezâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep their clients reasonably informed of the status of their matters; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent clients; 1.1, requiring lawyers to provide competent representation to clients; and RLD 1.1(b), prohibiting lawyers from willfully disobeying court orders.Andrew Becker represented the Bar Association.

This discipline was based on his violation of a temporary restraining order in 2003.In 2003, Mr. Fair's spouse commenced a dissolution-of-marriage proceeding in King County Superior Court. In August 2003, the court issued a restraining order prohibiting Mr. Fair from, inter alia, ""molesting or disturbing the peace"" of his spouse.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 2002 involving failure to maintain client funds in a trust account, failure to maintain complete records of client funds in his possession, and commingling his own funds with client funds.In 2002, Mr. Umuolo represented a client in a dissolution of marriage proceeding. In May 2002, the court entered a temporary order directing that the client move out of the family home. The court also ordered the client's spouse to pay the client $1,100 as a reimbursement for moving expenses, to pay Mr. Umuolo $1,000 as court-awarded attorney fees, and to pay $1,500 to Mr. Umuolo's trust account to be used for the client's future moving expenses. On June 5, 2002, anticipating the receipt of the checks, Mr. Umuolo advanced to the client $950 in cash from Mr. Umuolo's own funds. On June 6, 2002, Mr. Umuolo received three checks from opposing counsel in payment of the ordered sums. Mr. Umuolo immediately gave the $1,100 check to the client; he deposited the remaining checks into his trust account. At the time, Mr. Umuolo did not maintain any personal bank account; he used his trust account for all of his business and personal transactions, commingling his own funds with client funds. Mr. Umuolo maintained no check register for his trust account, nor did he maintain any client ledgers, nor did he prepare reconciliations of the bank statements. Mr. Umuolo relied on his memory to keep track of client funds in the account. At the time of the June 6, 2002, transactions, Mr. Umuolo knew that $550 of the $1,500 check he had deposited into his trust account belonged to the client.On June 16, 2002, the client died. Mr. Umuolo did not disburse the $550 in his trust account to the client or to anyone else on the client's behalf. Mr. Umuolo failed thereafter to maintain the $550 in his trust account, which, in August 2002, had a negative balance.In September 2002, opposing counsel requested an accounting of the $1,500 that had earlier been paid for anticipated future moving expenses. Mr. Umuolo responded that the amount that had been released to the client was privileged information and could not be revealed. Mr. Umuolo failed at that point to review his trust account and ascertain whether the former client's $550 was being maintained in his trust account.In July 2003, following a deposition of Mr. Umuolo taken in connection with the disciplinary investigation, Mr. Umuolo paid to the former client's spouse the $550 that should have been maintained in Mr. Umuolo's trust account.Mr. Umuolo's conduct violated RPC 1.14(a), requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer to be deposited in an interest-bearing trust account, and prohibiting funds belonging solely to the lawyer from being deposited therein; and RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds coming into the possession of the lawyer and to render appropriate accounts to the client regarding them.Randy V.

Panitch (WSBA No. 12393, admitted 1982), of Seattle, was suspended for 135 days, effective December 21, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2001 and 2002 involving lack of diligence, lack of communication with clients, failure to expedite litigation, failure to return client paperwork and to refund unearned fees at the conclusion of a representation, and failure to deposit client funds into a trust account.Matter 1: In 2002, a client hired Mr. Panitch to represent him in a pending federal action. The client paid Mr. Panitch $2,500 as an advance fee deposit for hourly work to be performed during the representation. Mr. Panitch deposited the check into his business checking account. In April 2002, the client flew to Seattle from Arizona for a scheduled meeting with Mr. Panitch. Mr. Panitch did not keep the appointment.In June 2002, the court entered an order granting the clientâ€™s motion to vacate an earlier default. Accordingly, the client was obliged to file an answer. In June 2002, the plaintiff notified Mr. Panitch by letter that, owing to the absence of an answer, it intended to move for a default order. Mr. Panitch did not respond to the letter. On July, 9, 2002, the plaintiff moved for a default order. Shortly thereafter, by e-mail, the clientâ€™s former lawyer advised Mr. Panitch to file an answer. The clientâ€™s lawyer also sent the message to Mr. Panitch via fax, in which he advised Mr. Panitch to contact the client. Mr. Panitch did not respond.On July 12, 2002, the client hired another lawyer, who filed the answer. Commencing on July 13, 2002, the client and his new lawyer made repeated efforts to contact Mr. Panitch to obtain the clientâ€™s file. Mr. Panitch did not respond to these overtures. In late August 2002, the clientâ€™s new lawyer warned Mr. Panitch that if the file was not delivered, he would file a grievance with the Bar Association. On August 28, 2002, Mr. Panitch replied that the file was available for retrieval. The new lawyer picked up the file on September 9, 2002. Although Mr. Panitch had performed only $1,000 worth of services, he never refunded any part of the $2,500 advance fee.Matter 2: In March 2001, Mr. Panitch entered an appearance on behalf of a client in a pending personal-injury lawsuit. After filing a notice of appearance in March 2001 and a confirmation of joinder in April 2001, Mr. Panitch filed no other documents in the case. The client informed her former lawyer that Mr. Panitch was not involved in the case, and asked him to fire Mr. Panitch. In November 2001, the former lawyer met with Mr. Panitch, informed him that the client was dissatisfied, and notified him that the client wanted Mr. Panitch to return the file. Mr. Panitch told the former lawyer that he would discuss the situation with the client and address her concerns. He did not, however, communicate with her promptly. In January 2002, opposing counsel noted the clientâ€™s deposition for January 22, the date of the discovery cutoff. By letter, Mr. Panitch notified opposing counsel that he voluntarily waived the discovery cutoff, thereby allowing opposing counsel to reset the deposition for January 24. Mr. Panitch did not communicate with the client about this course of action; he waived the discovery cutoff because of a personal scheduling conflict. On January 22, 2002, Mr. Panitch telephoned the client and asked her to appear for the January 24 deposition. During the conversation, the client informed Mr. Panitch that he was fired. Although the client had not authorized Mr. Panitch to communicate further with opposing counsel, Mr. Panitch assured opposing counsel by letter that there was an agreement waiving the discovery cutoff, and that if the clientâ€™s new lawyer attempted to resist a deposition and assert the discovery cutoff, Mr. Panitch would support the opposing lawyerâ€™s right to take the deposition. Mr. Panitchâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions; RPC 1.5(a), requiring that a lawyerâ€™s fee be reasonable; RPC 1.14(a), requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer to be deposited in an interest-bearing trust account; RPC 1.15(d), requiring that a lawyer take reasonably practicable steps to protect a clientâ€™s interests upon termination of representation (including refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned and surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled); and RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interest of the client.Anthony L.

674.html,14823,David Teske,,Disbarment,9/15/2004,,"David S. Teske (WSBA No. 14823, admitted 1984), of Edmonds, was disbarred, effective September 15, 2004, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2002 and 2003 involving settling client matters without authority, misrepresentations in legal documents, deceit of a notary public, misappropriation of client funds, and failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation.Matter 1: In 2002, Mr. Teske agreed to represent two clients in a lawsuit against their former employer. Mr. Teske negotiated a settlement of both claims without adequately consulting with the clients or obtaining authorization to settle for the amounts accepted. Mr. Teske executed settlement documents in which he falsely stated that the documents had been fully reviewed by the clients. Mr. Teske deceitfully persuaded a notary public to notarize signatures purporting to be those of the clients on the settlement documents. Mr. Teske received settlement checks in both matters and deposited them into his firmâ€™s bank account, but he never paid either client any of the settlement proceeds.Matter 2: In 2003, Mr. Teske failed to provide written responses to two grievances as required by the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct. Mr. Teske subsequently failed to appear as commanded by a subpoena duces tecum issued by disciplinary counsel in connection with the investigation of the grievances.Ms. Teskeâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decision regarding a settlement offer; 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions; 4.1(a), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or misrepresentation; 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; 1.14, requiring a lawyer to deposit client funds into a trust account and to pay to the client funds that the client is entitled to receive; and 8.4(b), prohibiting commission of a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and ELC 5.3(e), requiring a lawyer to promptly respond to any inquiry or discovery request made in connection with a disciplinary investigation.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

675.html,5385,W. Van Camp,,Reprimand,1/6/2005,,"W. Russell Van Camp (WSBA No. 5385, admitted 1973), of Spokane, was ordered to receive a reprimand, effective September 9, 2004, following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 1996 involving failure to sufficiently explain the terms of a fee agreement to a client and removal of funds from his trust account as fees before they were earned.In June 1996, a client hired Mr. Van Camp to handle a medical malpractice case against a Spokane physician. The client signed a contingent fee agreement and paid Mr. Van Camp $1,000. This sum, characterized in the fee agreement as an â€œearned retainer fee,â€ was an advance payment for attorney fees and costs to be incurred in conducting an initial investigation into the viability of the claim. Mr. Van Camp did not adequately explain the nature of the â€œearned retainer feeâ€ to the client, who did not fully understand the purpose of the payment. Promptly after the $1,000 was deposited into Mr. Van Campâ€™s trust account, Mr. Van Camp disbursed $35 to pay for medical records and $900 to himself as a fee. At that point, the fee had not yet been earned. Over the course of the next several months, the client advanced additional sums to pay for the costs of obtaining medical records and review of the case by a medical expert. The expert, a local medical practitioner, opined that he could find no evidence of medical malpractice. For this reason, Mr. Van Camp advised the client not to invest further in the case without seeking the opinion of an out-of-state medical expert.In March 1997, at the clientâ€™s behest, Mr. Van Camp filed a complaint against the Spokane physician; because the statute of limitations would shortly run, this was a precautionary filing to permit the client to decide whether to proceed. Ultimately, the client elected not to proceed and asked Mr. Van Camp to drop the lawsuit. Mr. Van Camp refunded the balance remaining in his trust account and instructed an associate to obtain a dismissal. In August 1997, an agreed order of dismissal was entered.Mr. Van Campâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; and RPC 1.14(a), requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer to be deposited in an interest-bearing trust account.Jean K.

678.html,1505,Alan Hall,,Reprimand,1/27/2005,,"Alan F. Hall (WSBA No. 1505, admitted 1974), of Edmonds, was ordered to receive a reprimand on January 27, 2005, following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 1998 and 2001 involving failure to communicate with a client, failure to provide competent representation, failure to act with diligence, asserting a claim for fees to the court without a basis for doing so that was not frivolous, failure to adequately supervise the work of an APR 9 legal intern, and charging unreasonable fees. Mr. Hall was retained by a client to recover unpaid pension benefits and to enforce the ex-husbandâ€™s continuing financial obligation to his client under a Snohomish County divorce decree. In January 1998, Mr. Hall entered into a written fee agreement with the client, capping legal fees at $500, and requiring monthly bills to the client. In January 1998, Mr. Hall wrote to the clientâ€™s ex-husband regarding payments, but took no further action until March 2000. During this time, Mr. Hall did not communicate with his client to keep her informed about the case. Mr. Hall sent the clientâ€™s first monthly invoice in June of 2000, following a request from the client. The $2,467.97 invoice greatly exceeded the $500 cap without any prior notice to the client. In March 2000, Mr. Hall filed a motion seeking to hold his clientâ€™s ex-husband in contempt for nonpayment. The motion was prepared and sent out for filing by a legal intern working under Mr. Hallâ€™s instructions. On May 15, 2000, Mr. Hall and his legal intern appeared before a pro tem court commissioner, who signed an order of contempt and a $6,400 judgment. In the proposed order, Mr. Hall had requested attorneyâ€™s fees of $3,000 and costs of $1,500, which he indicated to the commissioner based on fees and costs actually incurred. Actual combined fees and costs did not exceed $2,500. The commissioner reduced Mr. Hallâ€™s fee award because it included undocumented estimates of prospective costs and fees for which he could not verify at that juncture.Following the hearing, Mr. Hall directed the legal intern to prepare paperwork for the enforcement of the judgment, including a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO). Mr. Hallâ€™s legal intern had limited experience in domestic-relations law and judgment collections. In June 2000, Mr. Hall asked the commissioner to sign an ex-parte order approving the QDRO prepared by his intern. After the order was signed and entered by the court, Mr. Hall directed his intern to collect upon the QDRO and forward the order to the retirement office of the clientâ€™s ex-husbandâ€™s company for disposition. The QDRO was rejected by the companyâ€™s retirement office as failing to comply with the company retirement plan. In June 2001, Mr. Hall and his legal intern prepared an amended QDRO using the guidelines sent by the retirement office, which was qualified by the retirement planâ€™s administrator and resulted in monthly payments remitted to Mr. Hallâ€™s client.Mr. Hallâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a); requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable; RPC 3.1, prohibiting a lawyer from bringing or defending a proceeding, or asserting or controverting an issue therein, unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; APR 9(d)(1), requiring the supervising lawyer or another lawyer from the same office to direct, supervise, and review all of the work of the legal intern and to assume personal professional responsibility for any work undertaken by the legal intern while under the lawyersâ€™ supervision, and APR 9(d)(5), in which a supervising lawyerâ€™s failure to provide adequate supervision or to comply with the duties set forth in APR 9(d) are grounds for disciplinary action.Raymond S.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 2001 involving sexual relations with a client.Commencing in 2000, Mr. Williams represented a client concerning a sexual harassment claim against the clientâ€™s former employer and job supervisor. In January and February 2001, Mr. Williams and the client had extensive telephone contact in the evenings and on weekends and socialized with one another at night clubs. On two separate occasions in January and February 2001, at Mr. Williamsâ€™s residence, Mr. Williams had sexual relations with the client. After disclosing the facts regarding the sexual relations to her therapist and her spouse, the client terminated the representation and hired another lawyer.Mr. Williamsâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.8(k), prohibiting a lawyer from having sexual relations with a current client unless a consensual sexual relationship existed between them at the time the lawyer/client relationship commenced.Leslie Ching Allen and Marsha A.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 1995 involving the communication of incorrect information to a client about the amount of fees owed. (Mr. Burke is to be distinguished from Jerry L. Burk of Yakima.)Commencing in December 1992, Mr. Burke represented clients in a lawsuit alleging employment discrimination. The fee agreement required payment of an initial $10,000 fee to commence the representation. The agreement specified a $125-per-hour rate of compensation for attorney fees, but further specified that payment of any attorney fees incurred beyond $10,000 was contingent on Mr. Burke obtaining a monetary recovery in the lawsuit. In addition to paying the $10,000, over the course of the representation the clients advanced sums to Mr. Burke to be disbursed for costs, which he deposited into his trust account.In August 1995, Mr. Burke wrote the clients stating that the $10,000 fee had been fully expended and additional fees and costs were continuing. He further stated that, although the initial $10,000 had been earned, he was continuing to work on the case in anticipation of all legal fees being paid. He indicated that a total of $19,355.90 in attorney fees and costs had been expended, enclosed a document titled â€œTime Accountâ€ indicating that he had accrued $18,587.50 in attorney fees and $768.40 in costs, and he asked the clients to meet with him in order to â€œreach some agreement as to how the outstanding balance will be addressed.â€ Neither the letter nor the Time Account reflected any offset for the clientâ€™s prior payments nor did either credit the clients with amounts held in Mr. Burkeâ€™s trust account. The clients interpreted Mr. Burkeâ€™s letter as a request for payment of additional attorney fees that were not then due under the fee agreement.When the clients failed to meet with him, Mr. Burke terminated the representation and withdrew. Approximately one year later, the clients obtained a new lawyer, who settled their claim in March 1998.Mr. Burkeâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions.

682.html,17502,Alfredo Lopez,,Suspension,2/10/2005,,"Alfredo Lopez (WSBA No. 17502, admitted 1987), of Seattle, was suspended for 60 days, effective February 10, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. The discipline was based on his conduct between 1997 and 2000 involving repeated failure to file a clientâ€™s appellate brief, failure to take steps on termination of the representation to protect the clientâ€™s interests, and failure to respond as directed by an order to show cause. For additional information please see In re Discipline of Lopez, 153 Wn.2d 570, 106 P.3d 221 (2005).Between 1996 and 1997, Mr. Lopez represented a client in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. The client pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 70 months imprisonment, after which the client asked Mr. Lopez to file a notice of appeal.Mr. Lopez timely filed the notice of appeal, and the 9th Circuit set a July 29, 1997, deadline for the opening brief. Mr. Lopez failed to file the brief. On January 23, 1998, the 9th Circuit entered a notice of default instructing Mr. Lopez to correct the deficiency within 14 days and file a motion for relief from default. Mr. Lopez timely filed a motion for relief from default and an extension of time to file an opening brief until March 20, 1998, attributing his delay to an extremely busy trial schedule. The 9th Circuit granted the motion and extended the deadline to April 20, 1998. The order warned that â€œ[a]ny further requests for extension of time for filing the opening brief are strongly disfavored.â€Mr. Lopez did not file the opening brief by April 20, 1998, and on August 13, 1998, the 9th Circuit entered an order reiterating the instructions and warnings contained in its previous notice of default. Mr. Lopez timely filed a second motion for relief from default and an extension of time requesting until September 8, 1998, to file an opening brief. Mr. Lopezâ€™s accompanying declaration attributed the delay to an extremely busy trial schedule and recent office relocation. The 9th Circuit granted an extension to September 8, 1998. The order noted that Mr. Lopez had missed two previous deadlines and that failure to timely file the opening brief may result in his removal as counsel and may subject him to monetary sanctions. Mr. Lopez did not file the opening brief before September 8, 1998.In a letter dated September 25, 1998, another lawyer informed Mr. Lopez that he had been hired to represent the client on appeal. He requested the file and enclosed an authorization for release of legal information signed by the client. Mr. Lopez transferred the file to the new lawyer on September 29, 1998, and by letter requested that the new lawyer immediately inform the 9th Circuit of his retention. The new lawyer did not file a notice of appearance or a notice of substitution at that time. Mr. Lopez took no steps to ensure that he was no longer deemed counsel of record in the 9th Circuit or to ensure that the new lawyer had appeared on the clientâ€™s behalf.On March 10, 2000, no opening brief having been filed, the 9th Circuit issued an order to show cause requiring Mr. Lopez, within 10 days, to show cause in writing why he should not be sanctioned in an amount not less than $500 for failing to comply with the courtâ€™s rules and orders. Shortly after Mr. Lopez received the order to show cause, his assistant called the 9th Circuit to inform the court that Mr. Lopez was no longer the attorney of record. In May 2000, upon receiving further correspondence from the court referring to him as the clientâ€™s â€œretained counsel,â€ Mr. Lopez instructed his assistant to draft a letter to the court explaining that he had been discharged and the entire file had been provided to another lawyer.On May 25, 2000, the clientâ€™s subsequent lawyer filed a notice of appearance and a declaration requesting an amended briefing schedule. The 9th Circuit issued an order granting the request for an amended briefing schedule and stated the courtâ€™s order to show cause regarding sanctions against Mr. Lopez would be resolved separately. On June 28, 2000, the 9th Circuit entered an order finding that Mr. Lopez had failed to respond to its March 10, 2000, order to show cause and imposing a $500 sanction. Mr. Lopez timely paid the sanction and filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied. Ultimately, the 9th Circuit affirmed the clientâ€™s sentence.Mr. Lopezâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client; RPC 1.15(d), requiring that a lawyer take reasonably practicable steps to protect a clientâ€™s interests upon termination of representation; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interest of the client; and former Rule for Lawyer Discipline 1.1(b), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order.Douglas J.

Christopher (WSBA No. 24884, admitted 1995), of Seattle, was suspended for 18 months, effective February 14, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on her conduct in 1999 involving falsification of documents and forgery of a signature in connection with the filing of an offer of judgment. For additional information, see In re Discipline of Christopher, 153 Wn.2d 669, 105 P.3d 976 (2005).In 1999, Ms. Christopher worked as an associate at a Seattle law firm. In the first case Ms. Christopher was assigned to handle on her own, she represented the defendants in a civil action that was subject to mandatory arbitration. The arbitrator ruled in favor of the plaintiff. After receiving the arbitratorâ€™s ruling, Ms. Christopher became concerned, erroneously, that she had made a mistake by not submitting an offer of judgment to the plaintiff prior to the arbitration in order to preserve her clientsâ€™ right to an award of attorney fees in the event of a successful appeal to the superior court.On August 25, 1999, Ms. Christopher created an offer of judgment pleading, which she signed and backdated to July 27, 1999. She attached a stamped declaration of mailing on which she forged her secretaryâ€™s signature. Ms. Christopher filed the offer of judgment pleading and mailed a copy to opposing counsel. She also created a declaration in support of attorney fees, which stated that the offer of judgment was a true and correct copy of the defendantsâ€™ offer to settle and that it had been served on the plaintiff on July 27, 1999. Ms. Christopher created an entry in her billing records to falsely reflect that she had prepared and finalized the offer of judgment on July 27, 1999.Ms. Christopherâ€™s secretary subsequently concluded that Ms. Christopher had forged the signature, and she reported the matter to the law firmâ€™s management. Ms. Christopher was fired and informed that if she did not self-report the matter to the WSBA, the law firm would report it. On October 13, 1999, Ms. Christopher reported the matter to the WSBA.Ms. Christopherâ€™s conduct violated RPC 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; RPC 3.3(a)(4), prohibiting a lawyer from offering evidence the lawyer knows to be false; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here forgery) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Stevan D.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 1999 and 2000 involving the failure to provide clients with adequate notice of withdrawal. (Mr. Oâ€™Neill is to be distinguished from Stephen F.X. Oâ€™Neill of Blaine.) Commencing in August 1999, Mr. Oâ€™Neill represented clients in a lawsuit arising from defective construction of a rock wall in the clientsâ€™ backyard. The clients paid Mr. Oâ€™Neill $2,500 as an advance fee deposit.In September 1999, Mr. Oâ€™Neill filed a lawsuit against the contractor and its bonding company. At a June 2000 status conference, the matter was continued to October 2000 unless a confirmation of joinder, a statement of arbitrability, or a dismissal was filed before September 28, 2000.Mr. Oâ€™Neill met with the clients in July 2000. As a result of that meeting, Mr. Oâ€™Neill believed that he had been terminated as counsel because the clients left with their file materials. The clients, however, did not intend to fire Mr. Oâ€™Neill and believed that he was still their lawyer.Mr. Oâ€™Neill never filed a notice of withdrawal and never provided the clients with written notice that he was no longer their lawyer. In September 2000, the clients paid Mr. Oâ€™Neill additional legal fees of $355.69.On October 5, 2000, the court dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice, because Mr. Oâ€™Neill did not appear at the status conference. Mr. Oâ€™Neill received a copy of the dismissal notice from the court. The clients did not receive a copy of the notice from him. The clients learned the case was dismissed in September 2001 after examining the court file.Mr. Oâ€™Neillâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions, and RPC 1.15(d), requiring that a lawyer take reasonably practicable steps to protect a clientâ€™s interests upon termination of representation.Joanne S.

689.html,12618,Sandra Davis,,Suspension,2/23/2005,,"Sandra L. Davis (WSBA No. 12618, admitted 1982), of Lynnwood, was suspended for 18 months, effective February 23, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on her conduct involving preparation of a will giving a substantial gift to her mother, delay in distribution of assets of an estate, and misrepresentation of estate assets.In July 2002, an individual with whom Ms. Davisâ€™s mother had lived for eight years was hospitalized. During his hospitalization, Ms. Davis prepared a will for him. The will provided that Ms. Davisâ€™s mother would receive a testamentary gift of $10,000, in addition to a car and other personal property. The will further provided that the residue of the estate would be distributed among the testatorâ€™s children. Ms. Davis did not advise him to consult with another lawyer about the will.Shortly after the testatorâ€™s death in August 2002, Ms. Davis wrote to his children to inform them that he had left a will, that she was the executor, and that she would provide them with a copy of the will and contact them about settling the estate. But she did not promptly do so; instead, Ms. Davis decided to deliberately delay the distribution of estate assets. Between December 2002 and June 2003, Ms. Davis misrepresented her intentions regarding settlement of the estate and failed to provide the beneficiaries with an inventory of estate assets. In July 2003, after the children-beneficiaries filed a grievance against Ms. Davis with the Bar Association, Ms. Davis prepared and provided the beneficiaries with an inventory. At the time of his death, the testator had money in two bank accounts; with respect to each account, his daughter was a joint tenant with a right of survivorship. Hence, as of the date of his death, each account was the property of the daughter and not an asset of the estate. In a July 2003 letter sent to the beneficiaries, and in the inventory of estate assets that accompanied it, Ms. Davis stated that the two bank accounts were estate assets subject to distribution under the will. Included with the letter were affidavits prepared by Ms. Davis to effect the distribution of the bank accounts. The affidavit prepared for Ms. Davisâ€™s mother stated that her mother was claiming $10,000 from one of the bank accounts. The affidavits represented that the two bank accounts were subject to probate. At the time she mailed the affidavits, Ms. Davis knew that the two bank accounts were not estate assets and were not subject to probate. Ms. Davis never informed the daughter that the accounts were the daughterâ€™s property and not subject to distribution under the will.Ms. Davisâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.8(c), prohibiting a lawyer from preparing an instrument giving the lawyer or a person related to the lawyer as parent, child, sibling, or spouse any substantial gift from a client, including a testamentary gift; RPC 4.1, prohibiting a lawyer, in the course of representing a client, from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Scott G.

690.html,29701,R Phillips,,Disbarment,2/23/2005,,"R. Stuart Phillips (WSBA No. 29701, admitted 1999), of Indianola, was disbarred, effective February 23, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2001 and 2003 involving forgery and the filing of false documents, failure to keep a client informed about the status of a matter, and failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation.In August 2001, a client hired Mr. Phillips to represent her in seeking modification of a child support obligation of her former spouse. In December 2001, Mr. Phillips prepared and signed the clientâ€™s name under penalty of perjury on two declarations and on a child support worksheet, without indicating that he had signed the clientâ€™s name and without the clientâ€™s authorization. The declarations contained inaccurate information. At the time, Mr. Phillips knew the documents required the clientâ€™s original signature. Mr. Phillips filed the documents with the superior court without disclosing to the court or the adverse party that the client had not signed them. One of the declarations contained provocative and demeaning language, and the client would not have signed it.Mr. Phillips failed to keep the client informed about the status of the modification hearing. Mr. Phillips failed to notify the client that he had obtained an order continuing the hearing date; as a result, the client did not attend the hearing and was unable to assist Mr. Phillips in drafting the language of the final order. The court denied the clientâ€™s petition for modification of child support.During its investigation of the matter, the Bar Association obtained information indicating that Mr. Phillips may have signed another clientâ€™s name on a document. Although the Bar Association requested that Mr. Phillips provide that clientâ€™s file as part of its investigation, Mr. Phillips intentionally failed to produce the complete client file.Mr. Phillipsâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4(a), which requires a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter; RPC 3.3(a), which prohibits a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; RPC 3.4(b), which prohibits a lawyer from falsifying evidence; RPC 3.4(c), which prohibits a lawyer from knowingly disobeying an obligation under the rules of a tribunal except for an open refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists; RPC 8.4(b), which prohibits a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, forgery) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), which prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), which prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(l), which prohibits a lawyer from violating a duty imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here, ELC 5.3(f), the duty to respond to inquiries or requests about matters under investigation).Debra Slater represented the Bar Association.

691.html,7370,Paul King,,Suspension,3/9/2005,,"Paul H. King (WSBA No. 7370, admitted 1977), of Seattle, was reciprocally suspended for three years, based on an August 15, 2002, order of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington suspending Mr. King from April 25, 2002, through April 25, 2005. The Washington State Supreme Court's order of reciprocal discipline, entered March 9, 2005, imposed the suspension in Washington retroactive to April 25, 2002, in accordance with the dates in the District Court's order. (Owing to a clerical error in the March 9, 2005, order, the suspension did not expire until entry of corrective order on June 7, 2005.) This discipline was based on Mr. King's conduct between 1999 and 2001 in multiple pending federal matters. Matter 1: Mr. King filed an action on behalf of a client in 1998. In December 1999, Mr. King withdrew from representing the client in the midst of settlement negotiations. At the time, Mr. King's file reflected that he had failed to respond to discovery requests, failed to assert several claims that should have been asserted, and alleged a disability claim even though plaintiff appeared not to be disabled. Mr. King did not provide his file to substituting counsel for several weeks, and not until after the client had filed a grievance with the Bar Association. Mr. King subsequently filed a motion seeking imposition of an attorney's lien in the amount of $4,581.02, even though his contingency fee agreement with the client provided that if he withdrew from representation he waived any right to fees in the matter. In denying the motion, the court found that in December 1999, Mr. King had improperly attempted to change his contingency fee arrangement with the client to an hourly fee arrangement.Matter 2: Mr. King represented a purported plaintiff class with claims against a municipality under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution. In denying the motion for class certification, the court found that Mr. King had failed to make any attempt to meet the class certification requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.Matter 3: Mr. King represented a plaintiff on a claim for damage to a truck. The court imposed a $500 sanction on Mr. King on grounds that he had made improper use of profanity in a brief and urged the court to grant relief on improper grounds. At trial in the matter, Mr. King improperly advised the jury in opening argument of settlement efforts, failed to refrain from and failed to prevent his Rule 9 intern from engaging in behavior that disrupted the courtroom, and during closing argument improperly advised the jury that he strongly disagreed with the court's jury instructions.Matter 4: Mr. King represented a plaintiff in an action for violation of state and federal wage-and-hour laws. In July 1999, Mr. King participated in settlement conference with a magistrate judge. During a break in the conference, Mr. King was informed that the assigned judge had dismissed the case. Mr. King proceeded with the settlement conference and discussed the matter as if it were still pending, without promptly advising opposing counsel and the magistrate judge of the dismissal.Matter 5: Mr. King represented two plaintiffs in an action under the Fair Labor Standards Act. In September 1999, Mr. King filed an amended complaint adding new claims and joining a new plaintiff, but he neither sought leave of court to file the complaint nor served the complaint on opposing counsel within 120 days of filing as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4. In March 2000, Mr. King filed a motion and declaration for permission to file a third amended complaint, adding new claims and joining additional plaintiffs. However, he failed to serve opposing counsel as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(d). In March 2000, after expiration of the deadline for amending pleadings, Mr. King again filed a motion for permission to file an amended pleading but failed to file proof of service of the motion. In April 2000, Mr. King filed a certificate of service of the proposed amended complaint, but failed to indicate whether he had served the motion to amend, in violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(d); Mr. King also submitted a proposed, unsigned order in violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 11. In July 2000, Mr. King filed a motion of entry of judgment without noting the motion as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 7. Mr. King also filed a motion for entry of judgment in favor of several plaintiffs who had purportedly joined in complaints that had never been served. In September 2000, Mr. King filed a summary judgment motion after the cut-off date for the filing of dispositive motions.Matter 6: Mr. King failed to appear for a March 1999 status conference in a pending matter. In response to a show cause order, he explained that the date was not listed on his calendar. The court imposed a $250 sanction.Matter 7: After being sanctioned in Matter 6, Mr. King engaged in attempts to manipulate the District Court's case-assignment procedures in order to avoid having cases assigned to the judge who had imposed the sanction. In five matters, Mr. King voluntarily dismissed the cases and promptly refiled them. In one of the matters, when the case was reassigned to the same judge, Mr. King again voluntarily dismissed and refiled it, even though Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1) provides that a second voluntary dismissal is a dismissal with prejudice. The judge ordered a hearing to show cause why the case should not be dismissed with prejudice. In the other cases, the assigned judges reassigned the cases to the original judge, who set a status conference in each for the same date as the show cause hearing. Mr. King failed to attend the status conferences and the show cause hearing; instead, he sent an attorney from another law office to attend on his behalf, who indicated that Mr. King had been called away on a family emergency. The judge imposed a sanction on Mr. King of $100 in each case, with the proviso that the sanction would be vacated if Mr. King provided an affidavit from a physician stating that the medical condition was an emergency that could not have safely been addressed until after the status conferences were concluded.Matter 8: Mr. King submitted a declaration of a third party in support of a motion for an award of attorney fees. As a result of its own investigation, the court discovered that Mr. King had signed the declarant's name on the declaration without advising the court of this fact. There was no indication on the document that Mr. King was signing for the declarant. During oral argument on an order to show cause, Mr. King acknowledged that he was not familiar with 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1746, permitting the filing of a declaration in lieu of an affidavit, and he claimed he believed it was appropriate to execute and submit a declaration on another's behalf without disclosing the fact that the true declarant had not signed. In July 2000, the court imposed a $1,000 sanction on Mr. King.Matter 9: Three days after a discovery cut-off had passed in a pending matter, having conducted no discovery, Mr. King filed a motion to extend the discovery deadline. In denying the motion, the court additionally noted that Mr. King had failed to conduct a mediation by the court-ordered deadline. Three weeks after the mediation deadline, Mr. King filed a motion to appoint a mediator, which was denied. On the day of the deadline for filing dispositive motions, Mr. King filed a summary judgment motion without a supporting memorandum. Several weeks later, Mr. King filed a memorandum in support of the motion and intermittently filed supporting declarations. In May 2000, the court denied the motion, noting that Mr. King had violated the court's local rules. Two and one half weeks before trial, Mr. King attended a pretrial conference at which he agreed to waive his client's jury demand. During the conference, Mr. King appeared unfamiliar with the case and could not provide an estimate of the potential value of the case. As a result, the court, on its own motion, rescheduled the trial and extended the deadline for mediation and dispositive motions.Matter 10: Mr. King commenced an action on behalf of a client in May 1999. In March 2000, the judge ordered plaintiff to pay $1,600 as partial compensation for defendant's attorney fees incurred as a result of plaintiff's prolonged, unexcused, and unjustified failure to make discovery. The plaintiff was subsequently found in contempt for failing to pay the sanctions, and the judge ordered Mr. King to pay an additional $3,095 to defendant.Mr. King's conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.3, requiring that a lawyer act with reasonable diligence and promptness; RPC 3.1, prohibiting a lawyer form bringing or defending a proceeding, or asserting or controverting an issue therein, unless there is a good faith basis for doing so that is not frivolous; RPC 3.2, requiring that a lawyer make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; RPC 3.4(d), requiring a lawyer to make a reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper discovery request; RPC 3.4(e), prohibiting a lawyer from alluding to any matter that the lawyer does not reasonably believe is relevant or that will not be supported by admissible evidence, or from asserting personal knowledge of facts in issue; RPC 3.4(f), prohibiting a lawyer from stating a personal opinion regarding the justness of a cause in trial; RPC 3.5(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct intended to disrupt a tribunal; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.Leslie Ching Allen represented the Bar Association.

692.html,22588,Alec Schwimmer,,Disbarment,3/17/2005,,"Alec M. Schwimmer (WSBA No. 22588, admitted 1993), of Jacksonville, OR, was disbarred, effective March 17, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 1998 and 2001 involving failure to communicate with and diligently represent a client; misrepresentations to a court; multiple acts of misconduct relating to client funds and trust account matters (including misappropriation of client funds); failure to cooperate with disciplinary investigations; and testifying falsely during disciplinary depositions. For additional information please see In re Discipline of Schwimmer, 153 Wn.2d 752, 108 P.3d 761 (2005).Matter 1: In late 2000, Mr. Schwimmer commenced representing a client in connection with several criminal matters pending in superior court. Mr. Schwimmer signed a scheduling conference order setting an omnibus hearing in all the cases for February 2001. At the omnibus hearing, three of the matters were set for a May 15, 2001, change of plea hearing or for trial on May 30 in the event guilty pleas were not entered. Respondent failed to contact his client following the February hearing. Although he knew of the court dates, Mr. Schwimmer did not appear in court for the May 15 hearing or the May 30 trial date. He did not inform the court or the prosecutor that he would not be appearing on the trial date. The judge set the case over for May 31, 2001, and asked the prosecutor to attempt to contact Mr. Schwimmer. The prosecutor was unable to contact him. On May 31, the judge ordered the trial dates continued, appointed a public defender to represent the client, and set a hearing for June 5. At the June 5 hearing, Mr. Schwimmer appeared and agreed to withdraw. During the hearing, Mr. Schwimmer intentionally made false or misleading representations to the court about his physical and mental condition and about efforts he had made to obtain treatment for alcohol and/or drug abuse. Subsequently, during the course of an ensuing disciplinary investigation, Mr. Schwimmer made false or misleading representations in a deposition about his physical and mental condition and about efforts he had made to obtain treatment for alcohol and/or drug abuse.Matter 2: Between August 1998 and June 2001, Mr. Schwimmer engaged in the following conduct that established grounds for discipline:â€¢  Knowingly failing to maintain complete records regarding client funds in his possession, including the failure to maintain any running trust account ledger or balance or any individual client ledgers.â€¢  In two instances, disbursing sums that had been deposited into his trust account on behalf of clients without creating any records to establish what was done with the money or whether it was paid to or for the benefit of the clients.â€¢  In one instance, depositing settlement funds into his trust account without any accompanying information identifying a client, and disbursing those funds without creating any records to establish what was done with the money.â€¢  Failing to notify a client of receipt and deposit into his trust account of a $5,505.16 settlement check. â€¢  Intentionally misappropriating over $2,500 of funds belonging to a client and using the funds for the benefit of himself and others.â€¢  Causing his trust account to have a negative balance of $760.16.Subsequently, during the course of a disciplinary investigation commenced following the Bar Associationâ€™s receipt of notice of an overdraft on Mr. Schwimmerâ€™s trust account, Mr. Schwimmer failed to respond to requests for information, testified falsely regarding the source of trust account deposits and the disposition of client funds, and failed to provide a client file and a release for medical/treatment records as requested by disciplinary counsel.Mr. Schwimmerâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions; RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of a client paid to a lawyer be deposited into an identifiable interest-bearing trust account and that no funds belonging to the lawyer be deposited therein except as permitted by rule; RPC 1.14(b)(2), requiring that a lawyer identify and label client property on receipt and put it in a safe deposit box or other place of safekeeping as soon as possible; RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client and to render appropriate accounts regarding them; RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by the client the funds, securities, or other property in the possession of the lawyer that the client is entitled to receive; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation; RPC 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; former Rule for Lawyer Discipline (RLD) 1.1(a), subjecting a lawyer to discipline for any act involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, or corruption, or other act which reflects a disregard for the law; and former RLD 2.8(a), requiring a lawyer to promptly respond to any inquiry or request for information relevant to grievances.David A.

696.html,1385,Robert Larson,,Reprimand,10/21/2004,,"Robert H. Larson (WSBA No. 1385, admitted 1965), of Bangkok, Thailand, was ordered to receive a reprimand on October 21, 2004, following a stipulation approved by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2001 and 2002 involving failure to inform a tribunal of all relevant facts in an ex parte matter and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. In 2001, Mr. Larson was hired to pursue a cause of action for unlawful trespass for cutting trees and shrubs. The alleged trespass had been committed by an individual (hereinafter referred to as â€œF.A.â€) who resided on property adjacent to the clientâ€™s property. Mr. Larson commenced an action against the property owners but did not name F.A., who resided on the adjacent property but did not own it.F.A. hired a lawyer who, in July 2001, notified Mr. Larson that he represented the individual who had committed the acts alleged in the lawsuit. F.A.â€™s lawyer notified Mr. Larson that he would be asserting a number of defenses and that F.A. should be substituted as the sole defendant. Mr. Larson subsequently received a notice of appearance filed by F.A.â€™s lawyer.In September 2001, Mr. Larson obtained an order adding F.A. as a defendant. The order reflected that F.A. was the individual who allegedly cut down the trees and shrubs as agent for the property owners. In October 2001, F.A.â€™s lawyer filed and served an answer.By letter, Mr. Larson subsequently informed F.A.â€™s lawyer that he was filing a motion for default against the property owners; the letter indicated that Mr. Larson would give F.A.â€™s lawyer notice if he obtained a default judgment. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Larson received F.A.â€™s response to the motion for default. Mr. Larson knew from reading the response that F.A. intended to contest the entry of a judgment against the property owners. On October 25, 2001, the court entered an order of default against the property owners.Both Mr. Larsonâ€™s client and F.A. obtained expert arborists to render opinions on the issue of damages. The plaintiffâ€™s arborist valued the damage at $12,500, while F.A.â€™s arborist valued the damage at $615. The matter was scheduled for arbitration in February 2002.In January 2002, Mr. Larson obtained an ex parte default judgment against the property owners for $35,000 plus costs and fees without providing notice to anyone. Mr. Larson incorrectly believed that the Civil Rules did not require him to provide notice to obtain a default judgment since he had already obtained an order of default with notice. Mr. Larson did not recall that he had previously agreed to provide F.A.â€™s lawyer with notice if he sought a default judgment against the property owners.The motion for a default judgment inaccurately stated, â€œDefendants were all served on September 18, 2001, and none of them have either appeared or fled an affirmative pleading.â€ Mr. Larsonâ€™s supporting declaration inaccurately stated that he had obtained a default order against F.A. in addition to the property owners. Mr. Larsonâ€™s declaration attached a copy of the letter from his clientâ€™s arborist expert to support the clam for damages. Mr. Larson did not supply the court with the conflicting opinion by F.A.â€™s arborist expert.Mr. Larson never notified the defendant property owners about the default judgment after it was entered. In February 2002, Mr. Larson obtained an ex parte order for voluntary dismissal. The order of dismissal inaccurately stated that the â€œactionâ€ is dismissed without prejudice, and that â€œno costs are awarded to any party.â€ Mr. Larson subsequently sent the order of dismissal to F.A.â€™s lawyer together with a letter stating that â€œmy clients have decided not to go forward with the arbitration and have directed me to non-suit this matter.â€In August 2002, F.A.â€™s lawyer discovered that a judgment lien had been filed by the plaintiff against the property owned by the other defendants. F.A.â€™s lawyer reminded Mr. Larson of his October 2001 assurance that he would provide notice if he attempted to obtain a default judgment and asked Mr. Larson to vacate the default judgment. Mr. Larson refused to vacate the default judgment or correct the inaccurate statements in his pleadings.F.A.â€™s lawyer filed a motion to vacate the default judgment. Finding that the default judgment was improper, the court vacated the judgment in September 2002 and assessed $2,760 in Civil Rule 11 sanctions plus $108.50 in costs jointly against Mr. Larson and his clients. Mr. Larson personally paid the sanctions and costs.The matter proceeded to arbitration, after which a judgment for $1,924 plus $871 in costs was awarded to the plaintiff against all the defendants.Mr. Larsonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 3.3(f), requiring that, in an ex parte proceeding, a lawyer inform the tribunal of all relevant facts known to the lawyer that should be disclosed to permit the tribunal to make an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.Jonathan H.

Nordtvedt (WSBA No. 15622, admitted 1986), of Marina, CA, was ordered to receive a reprimand on March 24, 2005, following a stipulation approved by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on her conduct in 2003 involving obstructing a partyâ€™s access to evidence, knowingly disobeying an obligation under the rules of a tribunal, and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. In January 2003, an individual (hereinafter â€œL.B.â€) provided some documents to Ms. Nordtvedt and asked her to review them. The documents included a deed, a power of attorney, a contract, and a newspaper notice to creditors. Some or all of the documents related to property that was the subject of a quiet title action pending in superior court.Subsequently, the lawyer for the plaintiff in the quiet title action telephoned Ms. Nordtvedt and asked her about the documents. Ms. Nordtvedt declined to discuss them.In January 2003, Ms. Nordtvedt was served with a subpoena duces tecum issued by the plaintiffâ€™s lawyer. The subpoena commanded Ms. Nordtvedt to appear at a deposition on February 6, 2003, and produce some or all of the documents that had been delivered to her by L.B. None of those documents contained attorney-client communications between Ms. Nordtvedt and L.B.On January 27, 2003, after she was served with the subpoena, Ms. Nordtvedt returned the documents to L.B., but Ms. Nordtvedt retained copies.On January 28, 2003, Ms. Nordtvedt filed a motion to strike the deposition and to quash the subpoena. On January 30, 2003, a superior court judge denied the motion and ordered Ms. Nordtvedt to produce all the documents called for by the subpoena that were not attorney-client communications between her and L.B.On February 5, 2003, the day before the scheduled deposition, L.B. came to Ms. Nordtvedtâ€™s office and demanded that she give him the copies of the documents that she had retained. Ms. Nordtvedt acceded to the demand and gave L.B. the copies. On February 6, 2003, Ms. Nordtvedt appeared at her deposition without any of the documents called for by the subpoena duces tecum.Mr. Nordtvedtâ€™s conduct violated RPC 3.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from unlawfully obstructing another partyâ€™s access to evidence or unlawfully altering, destroying, or concealing a document or other material having potential evidentiary value; RPC 3.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly disobeying an obligation under the rules of a tribunal except for an open refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(j), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order requiring him or her to do or cease doing an act which he or she ought in good faith to do or forbear.Scott G.

699.html,16402,Theresa Olson,,Suspension,4/5/2005,,"Theresa A. Olson (WSBA No. 16402, admitted 1986) was suspended for two years, effective April 5, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on her conduct in 2002 involving sexual relations with a client.In October 1999, Ms. Olsonâ€™s employer, a public defense provider, was appointed to represent an individual charged with three counts of aggravated first-degree murder in King County Superior Court. Ms. Olson and another lawyer in the office were assigned to represent the client. During the course of her representation of the client, Ms. Olson developed romantic and/or sexual feelings for the client. An inappropriate personal relationship, with sexual overtones, ensued, as confirmed in a three-page handwritten letter that Ms. Olson sent from her home to the client at the King County Jail. In August 2002, Ms. Olson met privately, in person, with the client in a conference room of the King County Jail for the stated purpose of providing legal representation to the client. During the meeting, Ms. Olson knowingly and intentionally engaged in inappropriate intimate physical contact, including sexual relations, with the client. Ms. Olson made no disclosures to the client regarding any conflict of interest or the possible effects of an inappropriate personal and/or sexual relationship on him or his case, and obtained no written waivers.Ms. Olsonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after a full disclosure; RPC 1.8(k), prohibiting a lawyer from having sexual relations with a current client; RPC 2.1, requiring a lawyer to exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice in representing a client; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Joanne S.

70.html,17586,William Freeman,,Disbarment,6/20/2001,,"William I. Freeman (WSBA No. 17586, admitted 1988), of Vancouver, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective June 20, 2001, following a default hearing. The discipline is based upon his failing to diligently represent and adequately communicate with multiple clients, allowing a nonlawyer to hide assets in his trust account and splitting fees with this nonlawyer, charging unreasonable fees, and failing to cooperate with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.Matter 1: In July 1994, a husband and wife retained Mr. Freeman to represent them in a real estate transaction. On October 5, 1995, the arbitrator entered a $13,089.08 award against the clients. The clients directed Mr. Freeman to file a request for trial de novo. Mr. Freeman failed to file this notice within the 20-day deadline; consequently, the award became final. Mr. Freeman agreed to pay the clientâ€™s debt over time; however, the terms of the agreement were not fair to the clients. Mr. Freeman did not explain the conflict of interest or suggest that his clients obtain independent legal advice. Mr. Freeman breached the agreement and the clients paid the remaining debt.Matter 2: In the 1990s, Ms. N operated a company that dispensed hearing aids. Ms. N also assisted clients with filling out and filing disability claims with the Department of Labor and Industries (L&I). Ms. N charged a contingent fee for this assistance and also paid referral fees for referrals of clients with hearing loss. RCW 51.48.280 prohibits kickbacks, bribes and certain representation fees relating to L&I disability claims, including hearing-loss claims. L&I investigated Ms. N for violating RCW 51.48.280, and she retained Mr. Freeman to represent her. During the investigation, Ms. N and Mr. Freeman agreed that Ms. N could deposit her clientâ€™s contingent fee into Mr. Freemanâ€™s trust account to conceal that she was continuing to take these payments.Between 1998 and 2000, Mr. Freeman and Ms. N engaged in a business venture to represent individuals with hearing loss. Ms. N advertised for clients and then referred them to Mr. Freeman. Mr. Freeman then charged the clients contingent fees between eight and 12 percent. Ms. N or her employees actually performed the work on these cases. Mr. Freeman did not provide any legal services to these clients.Matter 3: In 1999, Mr. Freeman represented a criminal defendant arrested for violating sentencing terms and conditions. The prosecutor in the case told Mr. Freeman that he would not agree to release the client from custody. After this conversation, Mr. Freeman obtained the clientâ€™s release through an ex parte order. Mr. Freeman did not tell the judge that the prosecutor objected to the release. When the prosecutor learned of the release, the court scheduled a hearing. Neither Mr. Freeman nor his client appeared at the hearing. The court ordered a warrant for the clientâ€™s arrest and released the bail. The prosecutor charged the client with jumping bail. The client was arrested and later pleaded guilty to this charge.Matter 4: In 1999, Mr. Freeman represented a client charged with theft. After arranging for interviews with two theft victims, Mr. Freeman fell asleep during his questioning. He also fell asleep during the prosecutorâ€™s interview with the clientâ€™s alibi witness.Matter 5: In December 1999, Mr. Freeman represented a client charged with driving without a valid driverâ€™s license. The client required a state-subsidized interpreter. Mr. Freeman did not appear for the trial setting conference, so the date was continued. The client and the interpreter both appeared. Neither Mr. Freeman nor the client appeared for the continued conference, and the court ordered a warrant for the clientâ€™s arrest.Matter 6: In early 2000, Mr. Freeman represented a client charged with forgery. The court agreed to supervised release with several conditions. Mr. Freeman obtained his clientâ€™s signature on the release order without informing him of the conditions, and subsequently the client violated the conditions. Mr. Freeman did not appear for the clientâ€™s May 16, 2000 trial, nor did he provide any explanation to the court for his absence. On May 24, 2000, Mr. Freeman was personally served with the prosecutorâ€™s motion for sanctions and an order to show cause, requiring his appearance, but Mr. Freeman did not appear. The court found him in contempt for failing to appear at the clientâ€™s trial.Matter 7: In 2000, Mr. Freeman represented a client in a domestic-violence and stalking case. The prosecutor identified two critical witnesses for the case, and explained that they could be charged with obstructing a public servant if they failed to cooperate. Mr. Freeman agreed to represent the witnesses in a claim against the police while the domestic violence case was pending. Mr. Freeman did not explain the potential conflict of interest to the three clients and did not obtain a written waiver of the conflict. Mr. Freeman fell asleep during the prosecutorâ€™s interview of the critical witnesses.Matter 8: In 2000, Mr. Freeman represented a criminal defendant. Mr. Freeman appeared late for the first suppression hearing, submitted no pleadings or documents, and did not inform his client that he was required to attend the hearing. The court sanctioned Mr. Freeman $400, allowed him until the next day to file pleadings, and rescheduled the suppression hearing. Prior to the date of the hearing, the client was arrested on new drug charges, so the hearing was continued again. Mr. Freeman did not attend the second suppression hearing and the court sanctioned him an additional $1,000. The client was still in custody and was brought from the jail to attend the hearing. The court appointed a new lawyer to represent the client.Matter 9: In 2000, Mr. Freeman represented a defendant charged with unlawful possession of a controlled substance. After negotiating a plea agreement with the prosecutor, neither Mr. Freeman nor his client attended the hearing to enter the agreement with the court. Mr. Freeman also failed to appear for the clientâ€™s trial date.Matter 10: In 2000, Mr. Freeman represented a criminal defendant. Mr. Freeman failed to appear for the clientâ€™s trial-readiness conference. Mr. Freeman also failed to appear at a later readiness hearing. The client appeared at this hearing and told the court that he could not reach Mr. Freeman.Matter 11: In 2000, Mr. Freeman represented a criminal defendant. Neither Mr. Freeman nor his client appeared at the May 17, 2000 pretrial conference. The court authorized issuance of a bench warrant. The client contacted the prosecutor, who allowed the client to reschedule the conference. The client appeared at the rescheduled conference without Mr. Freeman, and the court appointed another lawyer to represent the client.Matter 12: In 2000, Mr. Freeman agreed to represent a criminal defendant. Mr. Freeman did not appear at a required hearing, and the court issued a bench warrant for the clientâ€™s arrest. The prosecutor served Mr. Freeman with a motion for sanctions and a show-cause order. Mr. Freeman did not appear and the court found him in contempt.Matter 13: Mr. Freeman failed to respond to the Bar Associationâ€™s written requests for information. He also failed to appear for his deposition after personal service of the subpoena. He did appear at a rescheduled deposition, but failed to bring the requested client files.Mr. Freemanâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.4, requiring lawyers to promptly respond to clientsâ€™ reasonable requests for information regarding the status of their matters; 3.3(f), requiring that, in ex parte proceedings, lawyers inform the tribunal of all relevant facts known to the lawyer that should be disclosed to permit the tribunal to make an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse; 8.4(d), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; 1.2(d), prohibiting lawyers from counseling or assisting clients in criminal or fraudulent conduct; 5.4, prohibiting lawyers from entering fee-splitting arrangements with nonlawyers; 7.2(c), prohibiting lawyers from giving anything of value to a person for recommending the lawyerâ€™s services; and 8.4(b), prohibiting committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer.Jonathan Burke represented the Bar Association.

700.html,7703,Phillip Miller,,Disbarment,4/8/2005,,"Phillip E. Miller (WSBA No. 7703, admitted 1977), of Bellevue, was disbarred, effective April 8, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2001 involving commission of a criminal act; conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation; and failure to secure a written contingent fee agreement; and his conduct in 2002 and 2003 involving failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation. Phillip E. Miller is to be distinguished from Phillip S. Miller of Seattle.Matter 1: Mr. Miller was employed by a licensed collection agency (hereinafter Corporation A) to pursue collection actions on claims assigned by Corporation Aâ€™s clients. Mr. Millerâ€™s compensation was based on receiving a percentage of the 33 percent fee that Corporation A charged for collecting assigned claims. The fee arrangement between Mr. Miller and Corporation A was never reduced to writing. In early 2001, Mr. Miller assisted certain owners and employees of Corporation A in forming a new corporation (hereinafter Corporation B) in order to avoid some of Corporation Aâ€™s liabilities. Mr. Miller became Corporation Bâ€™s president, sole corporate officer, sole director, and the only shareholder. Corporation B operated a lien-filing and collection business comparable to that of Corporation A, but Corporation B was never licensed as a collection agency. Mr. Miller continued to handle collection claims for Corporation B for a percentage of the collection fee charged by the corporation. The fee arrangement between Mr. Miller and Corporation B was not reduced to writing.In mid-2001, a client assigned a $150,000 claim to Corporation A for collection. Corporation B subsequently assumed the assignment of the collection claim. Mr. Miller filed suit to collect the claim. Mr. Miller subsequently negotiated with the debtor regarding payment of the claim. The lawsuit settled in August 2001, and the debtor paid $130,699.63 in full satisfaction of the settlement agreement. The sum was deposited into Corporation Bâ€™s bank account and Mr. Miller obtained an order of dismissal of the lawsuit. Mr. Miller was paid a fee of $19,059, constituting 40 percent of Corporation Bâ€™s 33 percent share of the collected sum. Neither Mr. Miller nor anyone else at Corporation B notified the client of the settlement or the dismissal. The general manager of Corporation B instructed Mr. Miller to attempt to cut a better deal with the client in order to increase Corporation Bâ€™s share of the settlement.Later in August 2001, a representative of the client contacted Mr. Miller to ascertain the status of the matter. Although Mr. Miller knew that the full amount owing had already been collected, he did not reveal this information to the client. Instead, he misled the client into believing that Corporation B had received an offer from the debtor to settle the matter for 85 percent of the amount due. The client indicated that it was not interested in such an offer, pointed out that the amount of the claim should have been greater, and insisted that a lien should be filed for the full amount. Despite the settlement agreement and dismissal of the lawsuit, the lien was filed and Mr. Miller received additional payments from the debtor. The total amount received on the claim was $149,777.67, of which the client was entitled to receive $100,351.04.In October 2001, Mr. Miller became aware of a shortage in Corporation Bâ€™s bank account balance resulting in an inability to pay the client what was due from the settlement funds. On October 15, 2001, the client again contacted Mr. Miller about the claim. Mr. Miller did not disclose that he had received the full sum owed by the debtor, but instead misled the client into believing that the debtor was offering to pay 85 percent of the total or to make periodic payments of 100 percent of the amount due. Mr. Miller confirmed these â€œpayment optionsâ€ in an October 16, 2001, letter to the client. The client did not agree to either of these proposals. In December 2001, the client learned from the debtor that the claim had been paid in full several months earlier. The client subsequently filed suit against Corporation B and Mr. Miller for moneys owed from the settlement. Judgment was confessed for $150,000. A settlement agreement required an initial payment of $50,000 followed by $2,000 monthly payments commencing in March 2002. Payments ceased in July 2003, with an unpaid balance of $70,000 remaining.Matter 2: In July 2002, during the Bar Associationâ€™s investigation of Matter 1, Mr. Miller appeared at a deposition in response to a subpoena duces tecum requiring him to bring all financial records relating to the handling of funds received in connection with the collection claim. Mr. Miller did not bring those records to the deposition. He testified that this was an oversight and agreed to provide the records. Mr. Miller never provided all of the records. As a result, it was necessary for a Bar Association auditorâ€™s examination to be based on microfiche copies of canceled checks and deposit items obtained from the bank. The need to reconstruct records greatly complicated the examination of the account.Mr. Millerâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.5(c)(1), requiring contingent fee agreements to be in writing; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting commission of a criminal act (here, theft in the first degree) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; former RLD 2.8(a), requiring a lawyer to promptly respond to any inquiry or request for information relevant to grievances; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here, ELC 5.3(e), requiring a lawyer to promptly respond to any inquiry or request for information relevant to grievances).Randy Beitel represented the Bar Association.

703.html,25536,Vicki Walser,,Suspension,5/16/2005,,"Vicki L. Walser (WSBA No. 25536, admitted 1995), of Valencia, CA, was suspended for two years, effective May 16, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on her conduct between 2001 and 2003 involving assistance to nonlawyers in the unauthorized practice of law, sharing legal fees with nonlawyers, failure to explain matters to the extent reasonably necessary for clients to make informed decisions regarding representation, lack of diligence, and conflicts of interest.In the fall of 2001, while working as a contract attorney for a Bellevue law firm, Ms. Walser became affiliated with an entity involved in marketing estate-planning products (hereinafter SELS). SELS sold annuities and other insurance products. SELS sought Ms. Walserâ€™s services to assist in the preparation of â€œliving trust packagesâ€ (LTPs) for SELS clients. Ms. Walser began drafting between one and four LTPs per month for clients obtained through SELS. After an SELS nonlawyer agent sold an LTP to a client, the agent would forward a completed â€œestate planning questionnaireâ€ to Ms. Walser. The information received from the agents included the clientâ€™s name, asset information, choice of trustees and/or beneficiaries, an engagement letter, and a check for Ms. Walserâ€™s services. The SELS agents were not supervised by Ms. Walser or any other licensed Washington lawyer when making sales of LTPs to clients. After receiving the information, Ms. Walser would review the information and draft an LTP using an electronic template. In most instances, Ms. Walser would have a brief telephone conversation with the client to verify factual information. Following her preparation of a draft LTP, Ms. Walser would deliver the draft LTP to SELS, which in turn would deliver the LTP to the client for signature and notarization. Ms. Walser usually did not accompany the SELS agent who delivered the LTP to the client, nor did she usually inquire of SELS as to what happened when the SELS agent delivered the trust document to the client. Ms. Walser never obtained copies of a clientâ€™s executed LTP from SELS after delivery.In one instance, in 2001, an SELS agent sold three LTPs and an annuity to a 76-year-old client. The agent collected a check for $900 made out to Ms. Walserâ€™s firm for preparation of LTPs for the client and two of her adult sons. The agent also collected two checks totaling $6,285 made out to SELS and a related entity for â€œlegal fees and services,â€ even though SELS and its related entities employed no lawyers. Ms. Walser received the $900 check and drafted LTPs for the client and the clientâ€™s two sons. The LTPs included â€œpour overâ€ wills to capture assets not transferred to the living trust at the date of death. When drafting the LTP, Ms. Walser spoke with the client on the phone for several minutes to verify factual information on the estate-planning questionnaire. Ms. Walser never discussed with the client whether the LTP she had purchased was the most suitable and/or economical estate-planning option for the clientâ€™s particular needs. Ms. Walser e-mailed the draft LTPs to SELS. The SELS agent delivered the LTPs to the client. Ms. Walser did not accompany the agent on the delivery visit. The agent notarized the LTP documents prepared for the client but failed to have the clientâ€™s execution of the pour-over will witnessed by two persons, with the result that the pour-over will was legally invalid. The agent never delivered the trusts directly to the clientâ€™s two sons, and they never executed their LTPs.In May 2003, Ms. Walser was deposed by the Washington State Office of the Attorney General as part of its investigation of SELS and its related entities for violation of consumer-protection laws. During the deposition, Ms. Walser asserted that she was present on at least one occasion where she witnessed an SELS agent providing legal advice to an SELS client. Ms. Walser terminated her affiliation with SELS several months after the deposition.Ms. Walserâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after a full disclosure; RPC 5.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from sharing legal fees with a nonlawyer; and RPC 5.5(b), prohibiting a lawyer from assisting a person who is not a member of the Bar in the performance of activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.

705.html,21764,David Ambrose,,Suspension,5/16/2005,,"David A. Ambrose (WSBA No. 21764, admitted 1992), of Edgewood, was suspended for two years, effective May 16, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct in multiple matters involving lack of diligence, failure to apprise a client of a settlement offer, failure to abide by client decisions regarding the objectives of representation, failure to communicate with clients, failure to refund unearned fees upon termination, failure to appear for depositions and comply with discovery requests, failure to comply with court orders, unauthorized communication with a person represented by counsel, conflicts of interest, and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. David A. Ambrose is to be distinguished from David R. Ambrose of Portland, OR.Matter 1: In August 2003, client A hired Mr. Ambrose to prepare a parenting plan/visitation agreement because his daughterâ€™s mother had stopped allowing visitation. The client paid Mr. Ambrose $1,800. Shortly thereafter, the client met with Mr. Ambrose, who agreed to have the initial paperwork completed in two weeks. At the end of two weeks, Client A telephoned Mr. Ambrose, who requested an additional week to prepare the paperwork. A week later, when they met to review the papers, Client A found the documents incomplete and inaccurate in many respects. In October 2003, Client Aâ€™s daughter made some comments at school that caused the school to report the mother to Child Protective Services. When Client A told Mr. Ambrose about this, Mr. Ambrose suggested that Client A seek full custody. Client A, however, told Mr. Ambrose that he discounted the allegations and believed that the mother remained the best custodial parent; Client A reiterated his desire that Ambrose complete the parenting plan as initially requested. Between November 2003 and January 2004, Client A repeatedly telephoned Mr. Ambrose, who failed to respond. In December 2003, Client A wrote to Mr. Ambrose demanding that he finish the work or refund the $1,800. Mr. Ambrose never finished the paperwork, nor did he refund the fee. Matter 2: Client B hired Mr. Ambrose in January 2003 to recover records allegedly taken by his business partner, M.R., following the dissolution of the partnership. In February 2003, Mr. Ambrose wrote to M.R. demanding that he return the records. Subsequently, Mr. Ambrose commenced an action against M.R. in superior court. Mr. Ambrose failed to comply with the courtâ€™s initial scheduling order. In April 2003, Mr. Ambrose failed to appear for the clientâ€™s deposition and the deposition of another witness in the case. Mr. Ambrose failed to comply with a second scheduling order entered by the court in April 2003. In mid-2003, thinking Mr. Ambrose was diligently working on his case, the client gave Mr. Ambrose an automobile valued at $2,500 for legal fees. After Mr. Ambrose demanded further payment, Client B gave him another automobile valued at $3,000. In October 2003, in ruling on a defense motion to dismiss for failure to make discovery, the court noted that Mr. Ambrose had appeared late for the hearing, ordered Mr. Ambrose to deliver documents he said were in his car to defendantâ€™s counsel by 10:30 a.m., and imposed a $1,500 sanction against Mr. Ambrose. Mr. Ambrose did not deliver the documents as ordered by 10:30 a.m. and did not pay the sanctions within five days as ordered. In January 2004, after finding the refusal to comply with the October 2003 order was willful or deliberate, the court dismissed Client Bâ€™s complaint without prejudice. In January 2004, a commissioner found Mr. Ambrose in contempt of court for failure to comply with the October 2003 order and fined him $150 per day until the documents in his possession were produced.Client B hired a new lawyer. Upon review of the file, the new lawyer learned that the defendantâ€™s lawyer had offered to settle the matter in May 2003 if both parties agreed to dismissal of all claims and to pay their own attorney fees. Mr. Ambrose had never communicated this settlement proposal to Client B. This ultimately cost Client B more than $12,000 in attorney fees assessed against him.In March 2004, a superior court judge found that Mr. Ambrose had intentionally failed to comply with the courtâ€™s January 2004 order. The court accordingly awarded a judgment to the defendantâ€™s attorney for $10,500 in sanctions. Although Client B paid Mr. Ambrose more than $8,000 in cash and/or cars, Mr. Ambrose never provided Client B with any billing statements and did not provide Client B with an accounting when requested. Mr. Ambrose provided Client B with his file only after repeated requests.Matter 3: In early 2003, Client C hired Mr. Ambrose to commence foreclosure proceedings arising from a $17,000 loan made to J.S., which Client C had originally expected would be repaid following the listing and sale of J.S.â€™s home. Mr. Ambrose did not file a foreclosure action, but instead, in March 2003, obtained from J.S. a durable power of attorney and a trust that named Mr. Ambrose as J.S.â€™s attorney-in-fact and trustee over all of J.S.â€™s property. J.S.â€™s only significant asset was his house; the trust made Mr. Ambrose a potential trust beneficiary. J.S. believed that if Mr. Ambrose located a buyer for the home, he could approve the offer. He did not understand that the trust documents would be recorded. In April 2003, a potential buyer, P.L., signed a purchase and sale agreement through the listing agent for J.S.â€™s property, agreeing to pay $255,000 in cash at closing. In May 2003, Mr. Ambrose recorded the trust documents as well as an option to purchase the property given by Mr. Ambrose to individuals who were his former and/or current clients. Under the terms of the option, Mr. Ambrose received $1,000 in legal fees.During a title search in connection with P.L.â€™s closing, the title company discovered the recorded trust, the quit claim deed from J.S. to the trust, and the option. As a result, J.S. first learned that Mr. Ambrose had recorded the deed and that, as trustee, Mr. Ambrose had sold an option to purchase J.S.â€™s property. J.S.â€™s lawyer informed Mr. Ambrose of the P.L. offer and asked him to revoke the trust. Mr. Ambrose refused to respond. Client C instructed Mr. Ambrose to conclude the P.L. sale. Mr. Ambrose refused, and the closing date was postponed.In July 2003, Mr. Ambrose, as trustee, filed a declaratory judgment action against J.S., P.L., and the holders of the option. Although Mr. Ambrose knew that J.S. was represented by a lawyer in the matter, he contacted J.S. directly by telephone in an effort to convince J.S. that the transaction with the option holders would be better than the P.L. offer. P.L. subsequently abandoned the offer and was dismissed from the lawsuit.In February 2004, Client C fired Mr. Ambrose. J.S. subsequently obtained Mr. Ambroseâ€™s removal as trustee. In September 2004, the pending declaratory action was dismissed. Once the title company received the order dismissing the case, it closed a new sale of J.S.â€™s property.Matter 4: In August 2002, a husband and wife hired Mr. Ambrose to resolve a family real estate dispute. Between August 2002 and December 2003, they paid Mr. Ambrose $2,900 in fees and costs. After filing a lawsuit in March 2003, Mr. Ambrose did little or no further work. He did not respond to defendantâ€™s discovery requests until they moved for sanctions. He canceled scheduled depositions. In April 2004, he appeared on the trial date and moved for a new judge, asserting bias. Although the motion was untimely, the judge decided not to proceed. Mr. Ambrose agreed to arbitrate the claim, but he did not take steps to do so. Mr. Ambrose did not keep his clients adequately informed about the status of the matter, and did not work on the matter after December 1, 2003. However, between December 13, 2003, and September 17, 2004, Mr. Ambrose collected an additional $2,200 in fees. Following his termination, Mr. Ambrose refused to refund any of the $2,200.Mr. Ambroseâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions about the objectives of representation and to consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued, and requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decision about whether to accept an offer of settlement of a matter; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions; RPC 1.5, requiring that a lawyerâ€™s fee be reasonable; RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after a full disclosure; RPC 1.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer from entering into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquiring an ownership, possessory, security, or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless the transaction and its terms are fair and reasonable and fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client, the client is given opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel, and the client consents; RPC 1.8(j), prohibiting a lawyer from acquiring a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of litigation the lawyer is conducting for the client; RPC 1.15(d), requiring that a lawyer take reasonably practicable steps to protect a clientâ€™s interests upon termination of representation, including refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned; RPC 3.2, requiring that a lawyer make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; RPC 3.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from unlawfully obstructing another partyâ€™s access to evidence; RPC 3.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly disobeying an obligation under the rules of a tribunal except for an open refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists; RPC 3.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from failing to make reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing party; RPC 4.2(a), prohibiting a lawyer from communicating about the subject of a representation with a party the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(j) prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order directing him or her to do or cease doing an act which he or she ought in good faith to do or forbear.

709.html,13294,John McKean,,Reprimand,5/25/2005,,"John Luke McKean (WSBA No. 13294, admitted 1983), of Moses Lake, was ordered to receive a reprimand on May 25, 2005, following a stipulation approved by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on his conduct between 1998 and 2001 involving failure to keep a client informed about the status of a matter, failure to render appropriate accounts to the client regarding distribution of client funds, and failure to supervise nonlawyer assistants.A client hired Mr. McKean to represent him in reopening an industrial insurance claim before the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I). The client agreed to pay Mr. McKean attorney fees in the amount of 30 percent of any recovery. The fee agreement, however, was inconsistent with the initial agreement, specifying an amount of 33 1/3 percent of any recovery. The application to reopen the claim resulted in the client receiving $34,856.69 in back time-loss compensation. Mr. McKean retained 33 1/3 percent of that award as attorney fees. The client thereafter received biweekly time-loss compensation benefits. Between September 1998 and September 1999, Mr. McKean withheld 33 1/3 percent from each of the clientâ€™s biweekly payments. The calculation of the fee paid to Mr. McKean was performed by Mr. McKeanâ€™s office staff; Mr. McKean was not aware that the client was being overcharged, but he did not make reasonable efforts to ensure that the work of his office staff was correct. In September or October 1999, Mr. McKean began charging the client 30 percent rather than 33 1/3 percent. At that point, the client had already been overcharged $1,576.18. Mr. McKean did not inform the client that he had been overcharged and that he was entitled to a refund, nor did Mr. McKean refund the difference between the fee charged and the correct amount.In June 2001, L&I issued an order denying responsibility for the clientâ€™s injury. The clientâ€™s time-loss payments terminated, and his L&I claim was closed. Mr. McKean sought reconsideration of that decision, but it was affirmed in December 2001. Mr. McKean appealed the decision to the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals, but after a hearing it was determined that the client had not suffered a compensable injury. In March 2003, Mr. McKeanâ€™s office staff filed a notice of appeal of the Boardâ€™s order in Grant County Superior Court. That filing did not comply with a statute requiring a petition for review to be filed with the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals. As a result, the clientâ€™s claim became final and unappealable.Mr. McKeanâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter; RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds coming into the lawyerâ€™s possession and to render appropriate accounts to the client regarding them; RPC 5.3(b), requiring a lawyer with direct supervisory authority over a nonlawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the nonlawyerâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; and RPC 5.3(c)(1), holding a lawyer responsible for the conduct of a nonlawyer assistant that would be a violation of the RPCs if engaged in by a lawyer in circumstances where the lawyer orders or, with the knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved.Debra Slater represented the Bar Association.

71.html,17596,James Barlow,,Suspension,11/4/1997,,"Spokane lawyer James J. Barlow (WSBA No. 17596, admitted 1988) has been ordered suspended for two years, pursuant to a stipulation for discipline approved by the Disciplinary Board on September 26, 1997. The discipline is based upon multiple counts of failure to act diligently or communicate with his clients, and ultimately, the abandonment of his practice, in violation of RPC 1.3 (duty to act diligently) and 1.4 (duty to keep client reasonably informed); withdrawal from the representation of a client without reasonable notice, in violation of RPC 1.15 (duties upon withdrawal); conversion of a $200 check for sanctions made out to him and his client, in violation of RPC 1.14 (preserving client property) and 8.4(c) (dishonest conduct); and failure to pay court-ordered sanctions, in violation of RPC 8.4(d) (interference with the administration of justice).In one matter, Barlow was appointed to represent an indigent defendant in his criminal appeal. The Court of Appeals set a due date for appellantâ€™s brief of July 22, 1996. By September 27, 1996, despite three warning letters from the Court of Appeals, Barlow still had not filed the brief. The court imposed terms of $100, and set the matter on the docket to dismiss the appeal as abandoned due to his failure to file an opening brief. The commissioner denied the motion to dismiss, but remanded for appointment of new appellate counsel. Barlow never paid the $100 sanction.In a second matter, a client hired Barlow in connection with a dispute with her auto insurer, who was refusing to cover damages arising from her daughterâ€™s collision with a fence. She paid him $500. He failed to take any action on her case. The matter eventually went to a collection agency, and the client was forced to pay an additional $214.22 in fees and costs. In addition, although Barlow returned the clientâ€™s fees and her file, the file was missing critical documents.In a third matter, Barlow had a contract with the Spokane County Public Defenderâ€™s office to handle dependency cases when that office had a conflict of interest. In December 1996, he was appointed to represent a woman in a dependency matter after her newborn daughter had been removed from her custody. He performed some work on the case initially, but in February 1997 he ceased work on it and broke off communications with the client. A new lawyer was appointed to represent the client and resolved the matter.In a fourth matter, a client hired Barlow to obtain a dissolution from his wife, who lived in Italy, and to defend an action brought by OSE for post-majority support of the coupleâ€™s two children, which was based on an Italian decree. The client paid him $2,500, and signed a blank dissolution form on December 11, 1995. Barlow did not provide the client with a copy of the summons and petition to serve on his wife as agreed until April 1996, and did not file the affidavit of service until nearly four months after he received it. In addition, he failed to take any action with respect to a statement of lien from OSE, resulting in the garnishment of a portion of the clientâ€™s pension beginning October 1996. Barlow withdrew from representing the client shortly thereafter, effective immediately. The client retained new counsel to resolve the matter.In a fifth matter, Barlow was appointed to represent an indigent defendant in his criminal appeal. He filed his opening brief in July 1995. On August 7, 1996, the Court of Appeals directed him to serve a copy of the transcript of proceedings on the client by August 17, 1996, because the client had filed a notice of intent to file a pro se supplemental brief. By October 8, 1996, despite two warning letters from the Court of Appeals, Barlow still had not served the transcript. The court imposed terms of $100. The client received the transcript on January 14, 1997. On January 27, 1997, the court granted appellantâ€™s motion to strike the brief filed by Barlow, and appointed new counsel to represent him on appeal. Barlow never paid the $100 sanction.In a sixth matter, a client hired Barlow to defend him in a child support modification action. In March 1996, the ex-wifeâ€™s lawyer failed to appear for a court hearing, and the court assessed terms of $200 to be paid to the client. The ex-wifeâ€™s lawyer sent Barlow a check for $200, made payable to Barlow and the client. When the client asked Barlow if he ever had received the check, Barlow replied that he was keeping the check ""in [the clientâ€™s] file"" to be applied to outstanding legal fees. But on April 30, 1996, the check was deposited in the Spokane Federal Credit Union, which was not where Barlow maintained his trust account. It appeared to have been endorsed by both Barlow and the client, but the client said he never saw the check, and the signature on the back of the check purporting to be the clientâ€™s signature was not the clientâ€™s signature.This client also hired Barlow to represent him in a proceeding brought by his ex-wife to recover $11,000. The client gave Barlow a check for $11,000, which was to be exchanged for a reconveyance of title, satisfying a lien. Barlow gave the check to the ex-wifeâ€™s lawyer, but never obtained the reconveyance of title and failed to return the clientâ€™s telephone calls inquiring about the matter. The client eventually hired new counsel.In a seventh matter, on February 26, 1997, the Court of Appeals, Division Three, entered an order entitled ""Order to Show Cause Why the Following Due Dates Have Not Been Met, Action Taken to Perfect These Appeals and Why Substitute Counsel Should Not Be Appointed."" The order covered three criminal appellate matters and six dependency matters in which due dates had not been met or action taken to perfect the appeals. Barlow did not attend the hearing, and the court appointed new counsel.In February 1997, Barlow abandoned his practice upon becoming hospitalized.Marc R. Roecks represented Barlow.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 2004 involving willful violation of an order directing his compliance with the California Rules of Court. In 2003, Mr. Jorgensen was disciplined by order of the Supreme Court of California. The order required, inter alia, Mr. Jorgensenâ€™s compliance with Rule 955(c) of the California Rules of Court (CRC) (requiring the filing of an affidavit of compliance with the duties of disbarred, resigned, or suspended attorneys) no later than April 12, 2004. In December 2003 and March 2004, a deputy from the State Bar of Californiaâ€™s Office of Probation sent Mr. Jorgensen letters reminding him that a CRC 955(c) affidavit was due in April. Mr. Jorgensen did not file the affidavit required by CRC 955(c) and, subsequent to the filing of a notice of disciplinary charges, offered no explanation to the State Bar Court of his failure to do so. Mr. Jorgensenâ€™s conduct violated California Business and Professions Code Â§ 6103, prohibiting willful disobedience or violation of an order of the court requiring a lawyer to do or forbear an act connected, with or in, the course of the lawyerâ€™s profession, which the lawyer ought in good faith to do or forbear.Felice P.

Daniel Graf (WSBA No. 18294, admitted 1988), of Olympia, was suspended for one year, effective July 8, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2003 in two matters involving failure to comply with duties on suspension, failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation, collection of an advance fee while suspended from the practice of law, practicing law while suspended, and failure to refund the unearned portion of a fee.On June 26, 2003, Mr. Graf was suspended from the practice of law on an interim basis by order of the Supreme Court. During the period of his suspension, Mr. Graf engaged in the following conduct that established grounds for discipline:â€¢  In two instances, failing to notify clients and others of his inability to act as required by Rule for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct 14.1.â€¢  Destroying documents contained in a client file after having been directed by the Bar Association to retain all records, files, and accounts relating to the matter.â€¢  Accepting payment of $500 in fees from a client knowing that he could not represent the client owing to the interim suspension.â€¢  Preparing a bankruptcy petition. â€¢  Failing to return the unearned portion of a fee to a client whom Mr. Graf could not continue to represent owing to the suspension.Mr. Graf's conduct violated RPC 1.15(d), requiring that a lawyer take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests upon termination of representation, including refunding any advance fee payment that has not been earned; RPC 5.5(e), prohibiting lawyer from engaging in the practice of law while on inactive status or while suspended from the practice of law; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here, ELC 5.3(f) and ELC 14.1).Jonathan H.

72.html,17773,Gerald Burke,,Suspension,6/12/2001,,"Gerald G. Burke (WSBA No. 17773, admitted 1988), of Tacoma, was suspended for 30 days by order of the Supreme Court effective June 12, 2001, following a hearing. Mr. Burke was reinstated on July 12, 2001. The discipline was based on his failure to diligently represent and communicate with three clients between 1993 and 1995.Matter 1: In September 1993, Mr. Burke agreed to represent a client in a paternity action. In April 1994, the court entered a summary judgment of paternity and set child support at $699 per month, reserving the issues of back support and visitation. On July 14, 1994, the arbitrator scheduled the back support arbitration for September 8. On July 18, Mr. Burke wrote a letter to the arbitrator indicating he had a scheduling conflict with the arbitration date. The arbitrator responded with alternate dates, and suggested that Mr. Burke reach a stipulation for a new date, or file a motion to reschedule. Although opposing counsel notified Mr. Burke that some of the arbitratorâ€™s suggested dates were acceptable to her, Mr. Burke did not reach a stipulation or file a motion to reschedule.On August 8, 1994, Mr. Burke wrote the client that he would withdraw from the case if the client did not make a $1,500 payment by August 15. Mr. Burke knew that the client, who had been on a payment plan for several months, could not make this payment. On August 12, Mr. Burke filed and served a notice of withdrawal that would take effect on August 28, 1994. During a discussion with the client about the withdrawal, Mr. Burke told him that he believed some of the motherâ€™s testimony over the clientâ€™s. The client then agreed that Mr. Burke should not continue to represent him.The prehearing statement in the arbitration was due August 25, 1994. Mr. Burke did not file or serve a prehearing statement or request an extension of time. On August 16, the opposing party objected to Mr. Burkeâ€™s withdrawal, indicating that she would agree to continue the arbitration. Mr. Burke then filed a motion to withdraw. On September 1, 1994, the arbitrator wrote to Mr. Burke that he was the lawyer on the case until he scheduled a formal hearing and had been granted leave to withdraw. The arbitrator stated that she would continue with the arbitration on the original date if Mr. Burke did not schedule a hearing on either a motion to withdraw or a motion to continue. Mr. Burke did not schedule either motion. On the day prior to the arbitration, Mr. Burke filed and served a second motion to withdraw, asking in the alternative for a continuance. He did not note this motion. On the same day, another lawyer contacted the arbitrator and the motherâ€™s lawyer requesting a continuance for Mr. Burkeâ€™s client. The arbitrator granted the continuance. The new lawyer resolved the back support issue without arbitration.Mr. Burkeâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.1, requiring lawyers to competently represent clients; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent clients; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed of the status of their matters; 1.7, prohibiting lawyers from representing a client if the representation will be directly adverse to another client or limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests; and 1.15, requiring lawyers to reasonably protect clientsâ€™ interests upon withdrawal from their matters.Matter 2: In 1994, Mr. Burke represented a client who was injured while working as a groundskeeper for a self-insured employer. The injury occurred on the premises of a metals business not owned by the employer. Prior to 1994, the employer paid Mr. Burkeâ€™s client $30,438. On August 2, 1994, the employer paid the client another $10,260. Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 51.24.060 et seq states that amounts paid by the employer become a lien against any recovery from the third party (the metals business).On March 4, 1994, the employer asked Mr. Burke in writing whether the client had elected to pursue the third-party claim himself, and explained that the statute gave the employer a lien on any recovery. On March 7, Mr. Burke requested that the employer send him an election form. On March 20, Mr. Burke mailed the signed election form to the employer, indicating the employee would pursue the third-party claim. The form acknowledged that the client was required by statute to notify the employer prior to any settlement and that the client knew the employer was entitled to recover the amounts already paid.On June 20, 1994, Mr. Burke settled the third-party claim for $46,000, but Mr. Burke did not notify the employer that he was settling the claim. The statute states that the settlement can be considered void if not approved by the employer. Mr. Burke disbursed the settlement funds without an order from the Department of Labor and Industries (L&I), which is also required by the statute. Mr. Burke withheld $15,459 from the settlement to pay for the clientâ€™s medical expenses.On August 24, 1994, the employer sent Mr. Burke a letter asking if his client intended to pursue the third-party claim. On August 31, Mr. Burke responded that he had settled the claim. The employer, who retained counsel to protect its rights in the settlement, asked Mr. Burke to provide information about the clientâ€™s injury, so it could determine whether to approve the settlement after the fact or void the settlement. On January 17, 1995, the employer asked L&I to enforce its lien in the amount of $22,868. Mr. Burke responded to both the employer and L&I that the problem arose because he had not been notified of the employerâ€™s lien rights or sent an election form. He told the employer that the remaining settlement amount was $15,4 59.On February 16, 1995, Mr. Burke agreed to pay $22,868 to the employer. Mr. Burke paid the employer $15,459, leaving the client responsible for paying the remaining $7,500. Mr. Burke did not explain to his client that his own interest in retaining his fee conflicted with his decision to have the client pay the additional $7,500 owed on the lien.In August 1995, the employer sent the client a warrant for the amount of the lien. When Mr. Burke received a copy of the warrant, he wrote a letter to the employer indicating the clientâ€™s agreement to make payments on the amount due. Mr. Burke did not advise the client that the warrant would become a lien on his home. During a refinance in June 1997, the client learned of the lien and paid the amount owed. In August 1997, the Bar Association suggested that Mr. Burke repay $7,500 to the client, indicating that this amount would be considered in mitigation of the sanction recommendation. Mr. Burke repaid the client after the client signed a three-page declaration stating that the client told Mr. Burke that the employer waived the lien. The client, who stated that he could not read all of the declaration, testified at his deposition that he had not told Mr. Burke that the employer waived the lien.Matter 3: On April 13, 1995, Mr. Burke agreed to represent a mother in motions for reimbursement of her childâ€™s medical expenses, contribution for future orthodontia, and an increase in monthly child support. On June 27, 1995, Mr. Burke filed a motion and arranged for service on the father. On September 14, 1995, Mr. Burke and the fatherâ€™s lawyer agreed to set child support at $396 per month; however, the client did not receive a copy of the letter memorializing this agreement.Mr. Burke drafted an order setting child support at $379 per month, obtained his clientâ€™s signature, and sent the order to opposing counsel, who noticed the lower child-support amount, and brought it to Mr. Burkeâ€™s attention. Mr. Burke entered the order with the court, and mailed a copy of the worksheets and order to the client. When the client saw the worksheets, she made an appointment with Mr. Burke to discuss worksheet errors. During this meeting, Mr. Burke did not notice the lower child-support amount. When Mr. Burke corrected the errors, the child-support amount was adjusted to $400 per month. Mr. Burke sent the corrected worksheet to opposing counsel, asking her to revise the order. Opposing counselâ€™s associate responded that Mr. Burke should prepare the corrected order and send it to her.In October 1995, Mr. Burke prepared corrected worksheets and an order setting child support at $396 and had them signed by his client. Mr. Burke did not send the amended order to opposing counsel or file it with the court. On November 9, the client went to Mr. Burkeâ€™s office because she had not heard anything about the corrected order. The client discovered that neither the court file nor the Office of Support Enforcement file contained the $396 order. In January 1996, she filed a grievance with the Bar Association. A few days later, Mr. Burke filed a notice of withdrawal in the clientâ€™s case. He did not provide a copy of the notice of withdrawal to the client.The client also requested that Mr. Burke seek reimbursement of out-of-pocket medical expenses. Mr. Burke did discuss this issue informally with opposing counsel. The father did not object to the request and asked for documentation of the actual expenses, which Mr. Burke sent. Opposing counsel then asked what portion of the expenses had been reimbursed by insurance. The client told Mr. Burke that the insurance company had sent the reimbursement checks to the father, who was the policyholder, and he had cashed the checks and kept the funds. Mr. Burke did not convey this information to opposing counsel or take any other steps to resolve this issue.Joy McLean and Maria Regimbal represented the Bar Association.

Daniel Graf (WSBA No. 18294, admitted 1988), of Olympia, was disbarred, effective July 8, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct involving multiple episodes of sexual relations with current clients, and his conduct in permitting false information to be submitted to a tribunal in connection with the disciplinary proceeding.Commencing in the early 1990s and continuing through 2003, Mr. Graf had sexual relations with five current clients. Mr. Graf did not adequately disclose to the clients information about how such a relationship could affect their interests or obtain written consent from the clients as to any conflicts of interest.Prior to his disciplinary hearing, Mr. Graf assisted disciplinary counsel in obtaining a signed declaration from one of the clients with whom Mr. Graf had had sexual relations. The declaration falsely stated that the relationship between the client and Mr. Graf had been professional, not personal. Although Mr. Graf knew the statement was false and knew that the information was expected to be admitted into evidence at the disciplinary hearing, Mr. Graf delivered the declaration to disciplinary counsel and took no steps to correct the information.Mr. Graf's conduct violated RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer's own interests unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after a full disclosure of material facts; RPC 1.8(k), prohibiting a lawyer from having sexual relations with a current client; RPC 2.1, requiring a lawyer to exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice in representing a client; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or misrepresentation.Jonathan H.

Lundahl (WSBA No. 21424, admitted 1992), of Lacey, was suspended for 90 days, effective September 19, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2002 and 2004 involving the commission of two assaults and the violation of a court order.In November 2002, Mr. Lundahl was charged with simple assault/domestic violence in Thurston County based on an altercation during which he kneed his daughter in the lower chest or abdominal area, pushed her to the ground, and punched her in the face several times. One of the conditions of the courtâ€™s pretrial order was that Mr. Lundahl abstain from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs. In June 2004, while the charges were pending, Mr. Lundahl consumed alcohol. That same day, Mr. Lundahl got into an altercation with his son, during which he grabbed the sonâ€™s throat with both hands, pushed him up against a wall, and pushed him down to the ground. Mr. Lundahl was again charged with simple assault/domestic violence. Subsequently, Mr. Lundahl entered pleas of guilty to two counts of simple assault.Mr. Lundahlâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, assault) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving any unjustified act of assault or other act that reflects disregard for the rule of law; and RPC 8.4(j), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order directing him or her to do or cease doing an act which he or she ought in good faith to do or forbear.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

Freeley (WSBA No. 11251, admitted 1980), of Olympia, was disbarred effective May 3, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2004 in several matters involving termination of representation without notice.In approximately October 2004, Mr. Freeley ceased practicing law without notice to clients, courts, or opposing counsel. In January 2004, Mr. Freeley had appeared as counsel of record in two domestic-violence matters. Throughout 2004, Mr. Freeley failed to appear at multiple hearings. By October or November 2004, other lawyers appeared for the clients. By that time, the prosecutor could no longer locate the victim in the first matter and was unable to serve the victim in the second matter. The prosecutor was obliged to dismiss both cases.In April 2002, Mr. Freeley was appointed ""standby"" counsel in an attempted murder case. In late 2004, Mr. Freeley began showing up late for court. In October 2004, he was removed as standby counsel after failing to appear for a pretrial hearing. It took several weeks for the Office of Assigned Counsel to find and appoint another standby counsel.In April 2004, Mr. Freeley was hired to represent the defendant in a probation violation matter related to a narcotics offense. In late 2004, the defendant ceased being able to reach Mr. Freeley. Mr. Freeley missed several court appearances in the matter. The defendant eventually resolved the matter pro se.As a result of Mr. Freeley's failure to appear in court on behalf of his clients, a grievance was filed with the Bar Association in November 2004. Mr. Freeley failed to respond to the Bar Association's requests for information during the disciplinary investigation.Mr. Freeley's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.15, governing the circumstances in which a lawyer may withdraw from representation and imposing duties on termination of representation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Joanne S.

73.html,17968,Barbara Beatty,,Disbarment,3/23/2000,,"Barbara Beatty (WSBA No. 17968, admitted 1988), of Seattle, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective March 23, 2000, following a hearing. The discipline is based on her Alford plea to two counts of securities fraud involving two clients.In 1992, Ms. Beatty began soliciting investment contracts to finance construction of six houses in Algona, Washington. She raised $229,000 from four investors. She did not invest any of her own funds in this project. Ms. Beatty misrepresented several material facts to the investors, including: 1) they would earn 30 to 50 percent return on their investments, with no reasonable basis in fact; 2) their investments would be fully secured, when Ms. Beattyâ€™s equity in the property did not fully secure any of the investments; and 3) she would have a buyer for each house prior to it being built, although she built only two houses and did not have a buyer until after the houses were completed. After the project failed, Ms. Beatty failed to fully repay the investors.Two of the investors were Ms. Beattyâ€™s clients. One, a 69 year-old woman, told Ms. Beatty that she was in failing health and that she worried about having enough money to live on prior to making the investment. Ms. Beatty told the client this was a safe investment. Relying on Ms. Beattyâ€™s statements, the client invested $25,000. More than a year elapsed between the time the project failed and when Ms. Beatty communicated this to her client. She gave the client a promissory note calling for $500 monthly payments.The other client invested $42,000 in Ms. Beattyâ€™s project. Shortly after making this investment, the clientâ€™s job situation changed, and she requested to withdraw her investment. Ms. Beatty returned $10,397.71, but convinced the client to leave the remainder. After several unanswered phone calls, the client retained counsel and filed a complaint against Ms. Beatty. Ms. Beatty sent the client $10,000, but never disclosed that she was no longer managing the project.Ms. Beatty pled guilty to two counts of securities fraud. Between the time of the plea and sentencing, Ms. Beatty repaid both clientsâ€™ principal with interest. As a result, one count was dropped and Ms. Beatty was sentenced on the other. She received 60 daysâ€™ home detention, 30 daysâ€™ community service and 12 monthsâ€™ probation.Ms. Beattyâ€™s conduct violated RLD 1.1(a), (i) and (p), stating that a lawyer may be subject to discipline for conduct evidencing a disregard for the rule of law; conduct reflecting adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer; and conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law.Linda Eide represented the Bar Association.

730.html,33377,Virginia Lauver,,Disbarment,5/9/2006,,"Virginia S. Lauver (WSBA No. 33377, admitted 2003), of Spokane, was disbarred, effective May 9, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on her conduct between 2002 and 2004 involving multiple acts of forgery and submission of false information on a loan application.In December 2002, Ms. Lauver filed petition for dissolution of marriage from her husband. Ms. Lauver did not serve her husband with a summons. Ms. Lauver subsequently filed an acceptance of service, which had been signed by her husband at her request in March 2003. The dissolution was ultimately granted by default, finalized, and filed with the court in June 2003. Ms. Lauver did not inform her husband of the finality of the dissolution proceedings, even when it was clear to her that he was unaware of it. In the divorce decree, dated May 30, 2003, Ms. Lauverâ€™s husband was awarded a 160-acre piece of property in Ada County, Idaho.  In June 2003, Ms. Lauver opened her own law practice in Spokane. In 2004, another lawyer joined Ms. Lauverâ€™s firm as a partner. In May 2004, Ms. Lauver filed a quitclaim deed at the Ada County Recorderâ€™s Office. According to the face of the deed, Ms. Lauverâ€™s former husband had awarded to Ms. Lauver title to the 160-acre property as a result of the divorce. Ms. Lauver forged her former husbandâ€™s signature on the deed. Ms. Lauver also forged the name of her law partner as notary on the deed.Subsequently, Ms. Lauver obtained a bank loan secured by the Ada County property. In support of the application for the loan, Ms. Lauver falsely stated that her former husband had died. She supplied the bank with a modified copy of the divorce decree inaccurately showing that she had been awarded the property in the dissolution. At the same bank, Ms. Lauver and her law partner opened a business checking account, a line of credit account for $50,000, and a capital loan account for $10,000. In May 2004, Ms. Lauver forged her law partnerâ€™s signature or endorsement on three checks (totaling $43,800), payable to herself, on the business checking account. She used the money from the checks to pay for numerous items, which included personal debts and business debts. In 2005, Ms. Lauver was charged with one count of forgery in Ada County and four counts of forgery in Spokane County. She pled guilty to one count of forgery in each county, with the single count of forgery in Spokane County encompassing the quitclaim deed as well as the three checks written on the business checking account. Ms. Lauverâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

733.html,13979,Donald Kronenberg,,Disbarment,8/18/2005,,"Donald Kronenberg (WSBA No. 13979, admitted 1984), of Seattle, was disbarred, effective August 18, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 1996 involving bribing and tampering with a witness and deceiving prosecutors regarding his role in procuring the absence of the witness. For additional information, please see In re Discipline of Kronenberg, 155 Wn.2d 184, 117 P.3d 1134 (2005).In March 1996, Mr. Kronenberg was hired by a client charged with three counts of felony rape of a child. The stateâ€™s principal witness was the victim, who had been subpoenaed and was expected to testify at trial. Prior to the commencement of the trial, Mr. Kronenberg met with the witness and offered him money in exchange for not appearing in court. The discussion was couched in terms of â€œsettlingâ€ a potential civil claim, but Mr. Kronenberg made it clear to the witness that he would have to leave the state and avoid testifying in the criminal case as part of the â€œsettlement.â€ Mr. Kronenberg authored a document to memorialize the witnessâ€™s agreement to leave town and not testify in exchange for $6,000 and a one-way plane ticket to Tulsa, Oklahoma. The $6,000 was to be paid in two installments, with the second installment conditioned upon the witness not appearing for trial. The agreement contained a confidentiality and nondisclosure provision, which purported to prohibit the witness from disclosing the existence of the agreement or of the alleged facts that formed the basis of the agreement. In July 1996, Mr. Kronenbergâ€™s client gave him $3,000 in cash. The next day, Mr. Kronenberg used the money to purchase a one-way plane ticket to Tulsa, which he gave to the witness along with the remaining cash. Mr. Kronenberg offered to drive the witness to the airport, but his offer was refused. At an omnibus hearing two days later, the court ordered Mr. Kronenberg to disclose whatever information he possessed about the witnessâ€™s whereabouts. Mr. Kronenberg did not provide the prosecution with any information and later instructed his secretary to not write down anything she learned about the witnessâ€™s whereabouts. Mr. Kronenberg then met with prosecutors and told them that they would have to dismiss the case because they did not have a victim. He also told them that he believed the witness had left for Oklahoma, claiming that the source of his knowledge was his private investigator. Mr. Kronenberg failed to tell prosecutors that he had met with the witness in Seattle the previous week or had hand-delivered to the witness a one-way ticket to Tulsa. Subsequently, pursuant to a court order authorizing it, the witness placed a wiretapped call to Mr. Kronenberg telling him that he was still in Seattle. Mr. Kronenberg encouraged the witness to leave town. He did not report either the conversation or his new knowledge of the witnessâ€™s whereabouts to prosecutors or to the court.Mr. Kronenbergâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assisting or inducing another to do so, or doing so through the acts of another; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.David M.

735.html,5742,Fred Misner,,Reprimand,7/27/2005,,"F. Michael Misner (WSBA No. 5742, admitted 1974), of Gig Harbor, was ordered to receive a reprimand on July 27, 2005, following a stipulation approved by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2003 involving the making of a false statement of material fact to a third person.In November 2001, Mr. Misner began representing a client who had been seriously injured in an automobile accident. The fee agreement provided for a 40 percent contingent fee, with costs to be deducted after payment of the attorneyâ€™s fee. In March 2003, Mr. Misner requested information from the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) about the amount of medical benefits paid on behalf of his client. DSHS notified Mr. Misner that it asserted a lien in the amount of $56,695.45 and enclosed a copy of the statement of lien. By letter, with a copy of the fee agreement enclosed, Mr. Misner asked to discuss the possibility of DSHS reducing its lien. DSHS responded that it would not waive or compromise its lien. Following a mediation, the case settled for $50,000 in April 2003. Mr. Misner advised DSHS of the settlement and again requested that DSHS waive or reduce its lien. DSHS refused to do so. Mr. Misner determined that there would be no money left for his client if the DSHS lien, together with his costs and fees, were deducted from the settlement proceeds. Mr. Misner told the client that he would waive $21,821.98 in costs that Mr. Misner had advanced. Additionally, in May 2003, Mr. Misner prepared and had his client sign a new agreement providing for a 75 percent contingent fee. Mr. Misner did not intend to charge a 75 percent fee. The purpose of the new agreement was to prevent DSHS from satisfying any part of its lien against the settlement proceeds, so that the client would receive a portion of the funds. In response to a September 2003 DSHS inquiry about the status of the case, Mr. Misner informed DSHS by letter that the case had been settled for $50,000, and he enclosed a copy of the May 2003 fee agreement along with a list of costs and expenses.  In the letter, Mr. Misner asked for written confirmation that DSHS would waive its lien. DSHS again declined to waive or alter its lien.Prior to entry into the disciplinary stipulation, Mr. Misner paid DSHS the share of the settlement proceeds to which it was entitled under the original 40 percent fee agreement. Mr. Misner took no fee so that his client would receive a share of the settlement proceeds.Mr. Misnerâ€™s conduct violated RPC 4.1(a), prohibiting a lawyer in the course of representing a client from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a third person.Scott G.

Crews (WSBA No. 27895, admitted 1998), of Portland, Oregon, was disbarred, effective August 26, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court imposing reciprocal discipline based on an order of the Oregon State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2000 and 2004 involving neglect of client matters, failure to take steps on termination of representation to protect client interests, communicating false information to clients about the status of their matters, forgery, falsification of documents, and failure to cooperate with disciplinary investigations.Matter 1: Mr. Crews was hired by a client to initiate a lawsuit for breach of contract, conversion, and unlawful trade practices in connection with restoration of a car. Mr. Crews commenced the lawsuit, which was dismissed in January 2001 for lack of jurisdiction over the defendant. Mr. Crews failed to inform the client of the dismissal; he instead falsely suggested to the client that the lawsuit was pending and moving towards settlement. In mid-2001, Mr. Crews prepared and provided the client with falsified settlement papers, onto which he had forged the adverse partyâ€™s signature. Subsequently, the client received a notice that the adverse party had asserted a lien on the car in question and would sell it at a public auction. Thereafter, Mr. Crews falsely informed the client that the car could not be sold because the lawsuit was still pending. In 2002, Mr. Crews falsely told the client that he had seized and sold property belonging to the defendant and was waiting for the sale to be recorded before forwarding the proceeds to the client.Matter 2: Mr. Crews was retained by a client to handle several different cases: â€¢ In March 2002, Mr. Crews filed a wrongful-arrest lawsuit on behalf of the client. The defendants moved for summary judgment. Just before the hearing, Mr. Crews falsely informed his client that the hearing had been cancelled and that the defendants had filed a notice of appeal. Thereafter, Mr. Crews prepared and provided the client with a falsified notice of appeal, onto which he had forged the signature of the defendantâ€™s lawyer. â€¢ The client also hired Mr. Crews to assist him in resolving a dispute with a mortgage company. In July 2003, after advising his client to stop making mortgage payments, Mr. Crews commenced a lawsuit against the mortgage company in federal district court. When the defendant threatened to foreclose on the clientâ€™s property, Mr. Crews sent the client a restraining order that purportedly prohibited the foreclosure. Mr. Crews had in fact falsified the order and forged the judgeâ€™s name on it.â€¢ In mid-January 2004, Mr. Crews recommended that the client file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding. The client informed Mr. Crews that he wanted to discuss the matter in person before filing. Without authority from the client, Mr. Crews commenced a Chapter 7 proceeding on the clientâ€™s behalf. In February 2004, Mr. Crews informed the client that he would be withdrawing from the representation.Matter 3: In May 2002, a client hired Mr. Crews to represent him in a wrongful-termination claim. The client instructed Mr. Crews to file a lawsuit and provided him with funds to do so. Between October 2002 and September 2003, Mr. Crews failed to pursue the matter. He falsely told the client that the lawsuit had been filed and was moving forward. In September 2003, Mr. Crews filed the lawsuit but thereafter failed to pursue it.Matter 4: In April 2003, Mr. Crews was hired by a client injured in an automobile accident. After filing a lawsuit, Mr. Crews failed to pursue the legal matter and failed to maintain adequate communication with the client. In February 2004, the court notified Mr. Crews that the lawsuit would be dismissed for failure to comply with arbitration rules. Mr. Crews neither responded to the notice nor informed his client of the pending dismissal. Beginning in early 2004, the client made numerous requests for the return of his file, to which Mr. Crews never responded. Matter 5: In July 2003, a former client filed a complaint with the Oregon State Bar regarding Mr. Crewsâ€™s conduct. Disciplinary counsel proceeded to investigate the complaint and, in December 2003, requested information. Mr. Crews failed to respond to the request. In the four above-mentioned matters, the clients filed complaints with the Oregon State Bar. Mr. Crews did not respond to disciplinary counselâ€™s inquiries and failed to cooperate with disciplinary investigations.Mr. Crewsâ€™s conduct violated Oregon DR 1-102(A)(2), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness to practice law; DR 1-102(A)(3), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; DR 1-103(C), requiring a lawyer who is the subject of a disciplinary investigation to respond fully and truthfully to inquiries from and comply with reasonable requests of a tribunal or other authority empowered to investigate or act upon the conduct of lawyers; DR 6-101(B), prohibiting a lawyer from neglecting a legal matter entrusted to the lawyer; DR 9-101(C)(4) requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to a client as requested by the client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive; Washington RPC 1.15(d), requiring that a lawyer take reasonably practicable steps to protect a clientâ€™s interests upon termination of representation; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Felice P.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 1999 involving a misrepresentation to a tribunal. In April 1999, Mr. Myles represented a client in an administrative appeal of the denial of unemployment insurance benefits. At issue in the proceeding was whether the client had wrongfully failed to return to his employment after his employer had determined that his work-related injuries had resolved. In connection with the claim, a physician had rendered an opinion that the clientâ€™s injury had been resolved, after which the physician had released the client to return to his employment. Expecting the employer to introduce the physicianâ€™s records at the hearing, Mr. Myles executed and submitted as a potential exhibit an affidavit stating that he had personal knowledge of the physicianâ€™s reputation for untruthfulness. Mr. Myles did not in fact have information supporting his representation concerning the physicianâ€™s reputation for untruthfulness.Mr. Mylesâ€™s conduct violated Oregon DR 1-102(A)(3), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.

Rosenberg (WSBA No. 21754, admitted 1992), of Liberty Lake, was suspended for 60 days, effective November 7, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2002 involving the alteration of a court order.Commencing in June 2002, Mr. Rosenberg represented a client in a dissolution of marriage proceeding pending in superior court. Following a June 7, 2002, hearing on a motion for temporary orders, Mr. Rosenberg and opposing counsel adjourned to counsel table to conform standard-form orders to the judgeâ€™s ruling. The judge signed the orders, believing that they conformed to his oral ruling. The judge then handed the signed documents to Mr. Rosenberg. Mr. Rosenberg told opposing counsel that he would copy the documents at his office and would return the originals and copies to the courtroom by 1:30 p.m. At his office, Mr. Rosenberg reviewed the documents and noticed the temporary restraining order was inconsistent with the judgeâ€™s oral ruling in a number of respects. Mr. Rosenberg altered the order to reflect his understanding of the courtâ€™s ruling. After realizing that some of his changes were erroneous and endeavoring to correct the mistaken changes, Mr. Rosenberg concluded that he would have to speak to opposing counsel about the situation, and he set the documents behind his desk. Later in the day, opposing counsel called Mr. Rosenbergâ€™s office to inquire about the whereabouts of the documents. Late on June 7, 2002, a member of Mr. Rosenbergâ€™s office staff took the papers to the courthouse, filed the originals, and gave copies to opposing counsel. Mr. Rosenberg did not contact opposing counsel or the judge to advise them that he had altered the order. Opposing counsel noticed the alterations and brought the situation to the attention of the judge, who promptly sought an explanation from Mr. Rosenberg. Mr. Rosenberg admitted that he had altered the signed order, explaining that he had intended to conform its provisions to those orally ordered by the court.Mr. Rosenbergâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.

745.html,21821,Clayton Longacre,,Suspension,11/10/2005,,"Clayton E. Longacre (WSBA No. 21821, admitted 1992), of Port Orchard, was suspended for 60 days, effective November 10, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2000 involving failure to provide competent representation to a client, failure to communicate, failure to act with reasonable diligence, and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. For additional information, see In re Discipline of Longacre, 155 Wn.2d 723, 122 P.3d 710 (2005).In May 2000, Mr. Longacre was hired to represent a client charged with drive-by shooting. Because the client planned to pursue a military career, he wanted to avoid a felony conviction. During their first meeting, Mr. Longacre did not go over the contents of the information or advise the client of the sentencing range for the pending charges. The prosecuting attorney subsequently amended the information to include charges of drive-by shooting, assault in the second degree, and a firearm enhancement. The prosecuting attorney faxed Mr. Longacre the amended information and a plea agreement, which specified a sentencing range of 74-84 months and included a 36-month enhancement for the firearm allegation. In exchange for a guilty plea, the prosecuting attorney offered a sentencing recommendation of 62 months and an agreement not to file additional charges. Mr. Longacre did not discuss the proffered plea agreement with the client. By letter dated May 26, 2000, the prosecuting attorney reiterated the standard range sentence for the pending charges, warned Mr. Longacre that he would amend the information to include four counts of assault in the first or second degree (all to include firearm enhancements), along with the drive-by shooting, and urged Mr. Longacre to thoroughly consider the 62-month offer. According to the prosecuting attorney, if the information were to be amended as described, the low-end standard-range sentence for the crimes charged would be nearly 51 years. Mr. Longacre did not convey this information to the client.In June 2000, the prosecuting attorney advised Mr. Longacre by letter that he would be making a 57-month plea offer to a co-defendant, and would extend the same offer to Mr. Longacreâ€™s client. Mr. -Longacre never communicated this offer to the client. During a psychological evaluation in June 2000, the client told an evaluator that he believed he could be facing up to 46 months. In July 2000, the prosecuting attorney advised Mr. Longacre by letter that based on the clientâ€™s apparent choice to go to trial he would arraign the client on a second amended information as described in the May 26 letter. Mr. Longacre did not share this information with the client. The client was arraigned on the second amended information, which charged four counts each of assault in the first degree and assault in the second degree, all with firearm enhancements, and one count of drive-by shooting. The client was tried in August 2000 and convicted of four counts of assault in the second degree with a firearm finding and drive-by shooting. The pre-sentence report included a standard range of 221-246 months based on the convictions.Before sentencing, Mr. Longacre approached the clientâ€™s former lawyer and discussed the trial. The lawyer suggested that Mr. Longacre withdraw from the representation, indicating that Mr. Longacreâ€™s conduct could rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. Mr. Longacre moved to withdraw in September 2000. After the motion was granted, the former lawyer took over as counsel and filed a motion for new trial. A new trial was granted on grounds that Mr. Longacre had provided incorrect sentencing information to the client regarding the proper sentencing range and the effect of firearm enhancements. The client ultimately pleaded guilty to a third amended information and was sentenced to 57 months pursuant to a plea agreement.Mr. Longacreâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

Patrick (WSBA No. 11655, admitted 1981), of Lynnwood, was suspended for two years, effective November 23, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. The discipline was based on her conduct between 1992 and 1996 involving lack of diligence; failure to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation; multiple conflicts of interest; false statements to a tribunal; false or misleading communications about her services; commission of criminal acts; conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation; conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; and statements implying an ability to influence improperly a government agency. In December 1991, Ms. Patrick began work as a staff attorney with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Social Security Administration (SSA). In September 1992, SSA approved a request by Ms. Patrick to establish a private law practice. In the request, Ms. Patrick specifically promised that she would do only pro bono bankruptcy work and a â€œminisculeâ€ amount of legal work for family and friends, and that at no time would her private practice result in a conflict of interest in fact or appearance. SSAâ€™s permission for Ms. Patrick to do so was subject to 17 conditions, which included avoiding any actual conflict of interest or the appearance thereof, not knowingly instructing persons on any particular matter pending before SSA/OHA, and not performing legal work on cases involving Social Security benefits or causes of action where the United States is a party or has an interest, or any other prohibited representational activities. Ms. Patrick resigned from her job with SSA in May 1996. Prior to her departure, Ms. Patrick had expanded her private practice beyond the approved scope without notifying SSA of the change in her activities or seeking to amend her request. During the period of her employment with SSA, Ms. Patrick engaged in the following conduct that established grounds for discipline:â€¢ Falsely stating in a Yellow Pages advertisement and falsely informing potential clients that she was a â€œformerâ€ SSA attorney, and falsely informing potential clients that she had successfully represented other claimants.â€¢ Representing four individuals with claims against SSA in contravention of 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 203 and 205, and without providing the clients with full disclosure of the material facts or obtaining written consent from SSA and from each client.â€¢ Representing clients in a bankruptcy proceeding in which SSA was a creditor without providing the clients with full disclosure of the material facts and obtaining written consent from SSA and from the clients.â€¢ Representing 24 bankruptcy clients, all with debts owed to the United States, in contravention of 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 203 and 205.â€¢ In order to avoid having to appear as a claimantâ€™s lawyer at an OHA hearing while still employed by OHA, falsely informing OHA that a client wanted her hearing date continued, and falsely informing the client that she had to reschedule the hearing date due to a conflicting commitment, despite knowing that the client did not want a continuance of her hearing.â€¢ In three instances, signing and filing (and in one case postdating) Appointment of Representative forms that falsely stated she was not prohibited from representing the claimants as a current or former employee of the federal government. â€¢ Informing undercover agents with the Office of the Inspector General of the SSA that she was a former employee of SSA and still had friends at that agency who could expedite her clientsâ€™ matters and obtain more favorable results for her clients.Ms. Patrickâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client or to a third person or by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after a full disclosure of material facts; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; RPC 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; RPC 7.1, prohibiting a lawyer from making a false or misleading communication about the lawyer or the lawyerâ€™s services; RPC 8.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, violations of 18 U.S.C.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 2004 involving trust-account irregularities. Prior to July 2004, Mr. Lancefield established a lawyer trust account in Oregon. Mr. Lancefield deposited client funds into the trust account. Mr. Lancefield used the trust account to pay personal, business, and client obligations. Mr. Lancefield did not make or maintain records reflecting deposits, withdrawals, or disbursements of client funds in his trust account, nor did he keep track of his time for purposes of charging or accounting to clients except as it may have been reflected in his client files. Accordingly, Mr. Lancefield did not know with any precision when he had earned funds in the trust account or how much he had earned. On July 27, 2004, Mr. Lancefield issued a check from the trust account when there were insufficient funds in the account. The bank honored the check, thereby drawing on the funds of one or more of Mr. Lancefield's clients without authorization. After the overdraft, the account had a negative balance of $10.23, which Mr. Lancefield rectified following notification. There was no assertion in the Oregon disciplinary proceeding that Mr. Lancefield's conduct resulted in actual injury to a client.Mr. Lancefield's conduct violated Oregon DR 9-101(A), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited and maintained in one or more identifiable trust accounts and that no funds belonging to the lawyer be deposited therein; and DR 9-101(C)(3) requiring that a lawyer maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to the lawyer's client regarding them.Felice P.

75.html,1808,G. Sweet,,Disbarment,3/27/2000,,"G. Michael Sweet (WSBA No. 1808, admitted 1968), of Seattle, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective March 27, 2000, following a hearing. The discipline is based upon his misappropriation of client and law firm funds.Matter 1: Mr. Sweet was a partner in a law firm from approximately January 1987 until April 1991. During that time, Mr. Sweet managed several real estate partnerships through which the firm members invested. Between March and December 1990, Mr. Sweet misappropriated approximately $55,866 from three of these partnerships. Mr. Sweet caused distributions to be made without the partnershipsâ€™ authorization. He also increased the amount due from the partners. In March or April of 1991, after questioning by his law partners, Mr. Sweet admitted taking $9,000. During this same period of time, Mr. Sweet misappropriated approximately $24,500 of firm money paid by clients for attorneysâ€™ fees. In April 1991, Mr. Sweet repaid the firm $24,500.Matter 2: In April 1991, Mr. Sweet transferred to inactive status. On May 18, 1992, he was suspended from practicing law in Washington for failure to pay his Bar Association licensing fee. In September 1993, a personal friend contacted Mr. Sweet about advice on settling his fatherâ€™s estate. Mr. Sweet told the friend that he was retired from practicing law and recommended Ms. L to the friend. Mr. Sweet also told the friend that because Ms. Lwas newly admitted to the Bar, Mr. Sweet would supervise her work. The friend retained Ms. L to handle the probate of his fatherâ€™s estate. The friend was named personal representative. Mr. Sweet periodically consulted with the friend and gave legal advice about the estate.In December 1993, Mr. Sweet asked the friend for $2,200 to pay an accountant to file income tax returns for the estate. Mr. Sweet also contacted the real estate broker and a mortgage company regarding the sale of the house that was part of the estate. When the house sold in July 1994, Mr. Sweet told Ms. L that he had the friendâ€™s permission to invest the proceeds. Ms. L deposited the $46,166.76 check into her pooled IOLTA account and then paid the money out either to Mr. Sweet or third parties at Mr. Sweetâ€™s direction. Mr. Sweet did not repay or invest the money. In October 1994, Mr. Sweet told the friend that he was taking the probate file from Ms. L to be sure she had done the work correctly. In November or December 1994, Mr. Sweet told the friend that he was afraid Ms. L had stolen the $47,000 she had put into her trust account. In late December 1994, Mr. Sweet admitted to the friend that he had talked Ms. L into giving him the house proceeds.Matter 3: In 1993, a friend asked Mr. Sweet to prepare loan transaction documents. The friend planned to loan his son money to pay off the sonâ€™s home mortgage. On May 5, 1993, the friend gave Mr. Sweet a check for $48,000 to pay off the sonâ€™s mortgage. Mr. Sweet deposited this money into his personal bank account. Mr. Sweet paid the sonâ€™s monthly mortgage payments until August 1994. When the son learned that the mortgage had not been paid off, Mr. Sweet told him that there was a problem with the escrow company. Mr. Sweet did not pay off the mortgage. On December 22, 1993, Mr. Sweet went to the friendâ€™s house and told him that someone had threatened to kill Mr. Sweetâ€™s wife and two children. At Mr. Sweetâ€™s request, the friend gave him $12,000. Mr. Sweet promised to repay the loan with interest. Mr. Sweet did not repay the loan until July 1994, when the friend threatened to tell Mr. Sweetâ€™s wife about his comment regarding the death threats. There was never a death threat against Mr. Sweetâ€™s family.On February 14, 1997, Mr. Sweet pleaded guilty to two counts of theft in the first degree. Mr. Sweet received an exceptional sentence on April 11, 1997. The court also ordered restitution.Mr. Sweetâ€™s conduct violated RCW 9A.56.030; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; RLD 1.1(l), subjecting lawyers to discipline for practicing law while on inactive status or while suspended from the practice of law for any cause; and RLD 1.1(p), subjecting lawyers to discipline for conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law.Jean McElroy represented the Bar Association.

Ms. Milnes was hired by a guardian to represent a client in a discrimination case under a contingent fee arrangement. In July 2003, the case settled for $1,500, plus $750 for appointment of a guardian ad litem to approve the settlement. Ms. Milnes then moved to Oregon, but did not advise the client's guardian of the move or provide the adverse party's lawyer with her Oregon mailing address. In October 2003, Ms. Milnes sent the client's guardian an e-mail saying that she was behind on approving the settlement stipulation and that a guardian ad litem needed to be appointed. A guardian ad litem was appointed in late October 2003, but the guardian ad litem had trouble reaching Ms. Milnes, as did the lawyer for the adverse party. Ms. Milnes subsequently telephoned the client's guardian to tell her that another lawyer would complete the settlement, but she provided no contact information for this other lawyer or for herself, nor did she arrange for other counsel to represent the client. In February 2004, the client's guardian attempted to visit Ms. Milnes at her Washington office but discovered that it was closed with no forwarding address. The client's settlement was not finalized until March 2005.Ms. Milnes's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; and RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.Nancy B.

Coogan (WSBA No. 16508, admitted 1986), of Tacoma, was ordered to receive a reprimand on September 29, 2005, following a stipulation approved by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on his conduct involving lack of diligence, failure to communicate with a client, and failure to refund an unearned fee.Mr. Coogan represented a client in a reckless-driving case. The client paid Mr. Coogan a $1,000 fee, which was described in the fee agreement as ""fully earned non-refundable."" During this time period, Mr. Coogan suffered from health problems and was briefly hospitalized. Because his condition was incorrectly diagnosed, Mr. Coogan believed he would recover shortly and be able to represent the client. However, he failed to explain this to the client. At three pre-trial hearings in the client's case, Mr. Coogan arranged for contract lawyers to appear and request continuances. During the representation, the client called and left messages, but he was unable to reach Mr. Coogan, who did not personally return the client's phone calls. After four months, the client hired other counsel and requested a refund of the $1,000 fee paid to Mr. Coogan. Mr. Coogan refunded $250 at that time. Approximately six months after a grievance was filed against him by the client, and over a year after the representation ended, Mr. Coogan refunded the remaining $750.Mr. Coogan's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyer's fee to be reasonable; and RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests upon termination of the representation, including refunding any advance fee payment that has not been earned.Anne I.

758.html,19944,William Joice,,Suspension,4/10/2006,,"William R. Joice (WSBA No. 19944, admitted 1990), of Seattle, was suspended for one year, effective April 10, 2006, by the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct in three matters involving failure to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation, failure to keep a client advised about the status of a matter, failure to return unearned fees, failure to inform clients that he could no longer represent them, and failure to withdraw from representation when he could no longer represent clients. [Prior to the entry of the suspension order, Mr. Joice had resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective February 24, 2006.]Matter 1: Mr. Joice represented a client with a claim against a contractor. Mr. Joice obtained a judgment against the contractor and the contractorâ€™s bonding company in Snohomish County Superior Court. In the meantime, Mr. Joice learned that other claims had been filed against the contractorâ€™s bond in King County Superior Court, and that the bonding company had surrendered the bond to the King County Superior Court. Mr. Joice and his client disagreed as to the best strategy for collecting the judgment. Mr. Joice advised the client he would have to share the bond proceeds with the other claimants on some pro rata basis, while the client insisted that Mr. Joice negotiate for a full recovery of his judgment from the bonding company because he had filed his claim first. The negotiations with the bonding company were not successful, and the other claimants filed a motion to King County Superior Court for disbursement of the bond proceeds. Because Mr. Joice disagreed with his client as to the strategy to best pursue the claim, he failed to represent his client with respect to the motion. Subsequently, the client contacted the King County Clerkâ€™s office and learned that the entire amount of the proceeds had been disbursed to the other claimants.Matter 2: In September 2004, Mr. Joice was hired by a client to represent him in a criminal matter. The client signed a written fee agreement providing for a $2,500 â€œNon-Refundableâ€ flat fee for all services and paid Mr. Joice in full. Prior to November 2004, Mr. Joiceâ€™s representation consisted of only advice to the client and obtaining two hearing continuances. Mr. Joice was arrested in November 2004. After the arrest, Mr. Joice was unable to provide further representation. Mr. Joice did not advise the client that he no longer represented him, did not arrange for other counsel to represent him, and made no accounting or refund to the client of the unearned fees.Matter 3: In September 2004, Mr. Joice was hired by a client to represent him on a domestic-violence charge. The client signed a written fee agreement providing for a $1,200 â€œNon-Refundableâ€ flat fee for all services and paid Mr. Joice $600 of the fee. Prior to Mr. Joiceâ€™s arrest in November 2004, his representation of the client consisted only of obtaining a continuance of a hearing. Mr. Joice did not advise the client that he no longer represented him, did not arrange for the client to obtain other counsel, and made no accounting or refund to the client of the unearned fees.Mr. Joiceâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.2(a), requiring that a lawyer abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable; RPC 1.15(a), requiring that a lawyer withdraw from representation if the lawyerâ€™s physical or mental condition materially impairs his ability to represent the client; and RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned.Randy V.

Meehan (WSBA No. 18295, admitted 1988), of Vancouver, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective June 20, 2001, following a stipulation. The discipline is based upon his submitting documents to the bankruptcy court in 1996 that misrepresented the amount of work done.In 1996, Mr. Meehanâ€™s firm represented a Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee. Mr. Meehan, an experienced bankruptcy attorney, was the primary attorney of record. As required by the bankruptcy code, Mr. Meehan submitted fee applications to the court for his compensation. The fee applications falsely represented to the court that work done by word processors and clerks was done by paralegals and paralegal assistants. Mr. Meehan edited the word-processor time records and changed some of their entries, for example, ""transcribe"" to ""draft,"" ""finalize"" or ""analyze."" The law firm received interim fees and costs of $62,616.89. A creditor filed an objection to the final fee application, alleging work performed by word processors was misrepresented as paralegal work. The bankruptcy court held two evidentiary hearings and entered a finding that Mr. Meehan knew that word-processor work was not compensable and, therefore, made a conscious decision to request compensation for services that were not compensable.Mr. Meehanâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 3.3(a), prohibiting making false statements of material fact or offering false evidence to a tribunal; 3.4(b), prohibiting falsifying evidence; and 8.4(d), prohibiting engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Jonathan Burke represented the Bar Association.

760.html,15578,Jeffrey Poole,,Suspension,1/14/2006,,"Jeffrey G. Poole (WSBA No. 15578, admitted 1986), of Seattle, was suspended for six months, effective January 14, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2001 involving failure to provide an accurate accounting to a client regarding distribution of funds and misrepresentations in the preparation and backdating of an invoice. For additional information, please see In re Discipline of Poole, 156 Wn.2d 196, 125 P.3d 954 (2006).Starting in 1999, Mr. Poole represented a client with a claim against a corporation for failure to pay for services performed. Following a trial, the superior court ruled in the client's favor. The defendant subsequently paid the judgment balance to Mr. Poole's law firm, which applied the funds in part towards unpaid legal fees and disbursed the remainder to the client. Mr. Poole's office failed to credit the client's account with a $27,675.35 fee payment, instead crediting the account with only a $20,000 payment. Consequently, from February 2001 onward, invoices sent to the client reflected an amount owing of approximately $16,000, which was $7,675.35 in excess of the actual balance. To satisfy the outstanding legal fees, Mr. Poole and the client agreed that the client would work off the remaining balance by performing trench work on a parcel of real property owned by Mr. Poole's limited liability company. Mr. Poole believed that the project would cost no more than $4,500, but he never conveyed that belief to the client.In May 2001, after the client completed the trench work, he faxed Mr. Poole an invoice for $26,547.98. Deducting the $16,094.43, which the client believed to be the outstanding balance owing, and $500 that Mr. Poole had paid for costs, the client alleged that Mr. Poole owed him $9,953.55 for the completed work. The client also alleged that Mr. Poole was wrongfully withholding a portion of the client's judgment award in his trust account. Unable to resolve the dispute with Mr. Poole, the client recorded a mechanic's lien against Mr. Poole's property for failure to pay for services performed. Mr. Poole filed a motion for order to show cause to declare the mechanic's lien frivolous, asserting that the client had been paid in full when Mr. Poole wrote off the balance owing. The client hired a lawyer to respond to the motion. According to Mr. Poole, at this point he discovered the accounting errors, which he attributed to his bookkeeper. Mr. Poole faxed the lawyer several documents, including an invoice dated May 28, 2001, indicating that a credit had been applied on that date to the client's outstanding balance and that, accordingly, the balance owing was zero. In fact, Mr. Poole had created and then backdated an invoice in October 2001 to appear to be an invoice created in May 2001. Mr. Poole and the client's new lawyer subsequently negotiated a settlement agreement in which Mr. Poole agreed that his firm would pay the client $7,675.35 plus interest, attorney fees, and costs in exchange for the client's release of the lien against the property and a mutual release of all other claims. When Mr. Poole failed to pay in accordance with the settlement agreement, the client commenced a lawsuit. Ultimately, Mr. Poole's firm paid the client $7,675.35 plus interest and between $25,000 and $29,000 for attorney fees and costs. Mr. Poole's conduct violated RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 3.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from falsifying evidence; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.Michael D.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 1999 through 2003 involving the failure to act with reasonable diligence in representing the personal representative of an estate. Commencing in May 1998, Mr. Brown represented the personal representative in the probate of an estate. Between March 1999 and February 2001, Mr. Brown took no substantial action to administer or close the estate. Between February 2001 and March 2003, when he terminated the representation, Mr. Brown engaged in a course of neglectful conduct that included the following: failing to timely provide sufficient information to the estateâ€™s accountant; mailing documents to the personal representative at an address Mr. Brown knew was not current; failing to promptly effect the transfer of property in another state or initiate an ancillary probate; misplacing the estateâ€™s tax refund checks; and failing to close the estate.Mr. Brownâ€™s conduct violated Oregon DR 6-101(B), prohibiting a lawyer from neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him or her.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 2002 and 2003 involving the deposit of funds belonging to his law firm into his personal bank account.Mr. Higgins was a partner in a Seattle law firm. On 16 occasions during 2002 and 2003 Mr. Higgins received payments directly from clients for work he had performed as a firm lawyer. Instead of routing the checks into one of the firm's bank accounts, Mr. Higgins deposited the funds into a personal, individual checking account.

Mr. Higgins cooperated with the firm's ensuing investigation of the matter. The firm later accepted Mr. Higgins's resignation, effective December 31, 2003. Mr. Higgins and the firm agreed on the total amount owed and also agreed to deduct that amount from Mr. Higgins's profit share, which was adequate to cover the loss.Mr. Higgins's conduct violated RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Eugene I.

766.html,4989,Hamersley Wright,,Suspension,2/3/2006,,"Hamersley S. Wright (WSBA No. 4989, admitted 1973), of Clinton, was suspended for three months, effective February 3, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct between 1996 and 2001 involving failure to diligently conclude a probate matter, failure to communicate with a client, and failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation.In April 1996, Mr. Wright was hired to probate the estate of a Washington resident who had died intestate in 1994. The sole beneficiary of the estate was the decedent's mother. In September 1996, Mr. Wright filed a petition for administration and was appointed personal representative. Over the next nine months, Mr. Wright filed the appropriate pleadings, resolved two creditors' claims, and filed an inventory. In October 1996, the IRS sent the estate a deficiency notice for the tax year 1992, assessing the decedent $7,939.41 in estimated taxes plus accrued interest and penalties. Although the estate had sufficient assets to pay the IRS assessment, Mr. Wright did not pay or resolve the tax deficiency. In August 1998, Mr. Wright asked an accountant to prepare the decedent's 1992 tax return. In October 1998, the IRS's automated collection system notified Mr. Wright that the amount due and owing for the decedent's 1992 income taxes was $8,244.76, plus $2,112.91 in interest and penalties. At that point, the estate had sufficient assets to pay the IRS deficiency, with interest and penalties. Mr. Wright filed the 1992 tax return and enclosed a trust account check for $3,808, the accountant's estimate of taxes owed for 1992. In March 1999, the IRS sent to Mr. Wright a notice that it had adjusted the estate's gross income, taxable income, and penalty charge, and that the estate owed an additional $4,886.21 in taxes, interest, and penalties. The IRS requested payment by April 1, 1999. Mr. Wright did not pay the tax deficiency.In August 2000, the estate beneficiary filed a grievance, in which she alleged that probate was still open, that certified mail she sent to Mr. Wright had been returned unclaimed, and that Mr. Wright would not return her phone calls. Mr. Wright did not respond to the Bar Association's request for a response to the grievance. After the Bar Association served Mr. Wright with a subpoena for a noncooperation deposition, he admitted to disciplinary counsel that the estate beneficiary had some legitimate complaints and that he had been lax in completing probate. Shortly after the deposition, Mr. Wright sent a letter to the court requesting that the probate proceedings be kept open for an additional 60 days. Mr. Wright also wrote to the beneficiary advising her about the IRS dispute and recommending that she authorize him to pay $4,000 to the IRS so that he could close the estate. Mr. Wright did not subsequently pay the $4,000 or close the estate. In March 2001, he advised the estate beneficiary that he was retiring from the practice of law. Mr. Wright hired another lawyer to conclude the probate while Mr. Wright remained the personal representative. Mr. Wright transferred the $2,085 of estate funds remaining in his trust account to the new lawyer, intending that it be used to pay the tax deficiency. The balance of the estate's assets remains held in a brokerage account. Over the following several years, the new lawyer charged the estate at least $2,085 in legal fees but did not resolve the tax issue or conclude probating the estate.Mr. Wright's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; and ELC 5.3(e), requiring a lawyer to promptly respond to any inquiry or request made under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct for information relevant to grievances or matters under investigation.Leslie C.

767.html,25414,Bruce Hawkins,,Disbarment,2/3/2006,,"Bruce E. Hawkins (WSBA No. 25414, admitted 1995), of Gig Harbor, was disbarred, effective February 3, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2003 and 2004 involving businesses that promised, but did not achieve, reduction or elimination of credit-card debt.Mr. Hawkins became involved with three nonlawyer-operated website businesses that promoted the ability to reduce or eliminate consumer credit-card debt through private arbitrations. At the request of one of the nonlawyers, Mr. Hawkins reviewed materials connected to the debt-elimination program and suggested changes. Mr. Hawkins allowed his name to be used in promotional materials for the program, including a DVD presentation that claimed that Mr. Hawkins ""literally has over 98 percent success rate when he goes to arbitration."" In these materials, which were mailed to potential program customers, Mr. Hawkins represented that credit-card debtors were not bound to the arbitration services specified in their cardholder agreements and should not have to repay their debt on a national bank's credit card because national banks cannot lend credit. Mr. Hawkins knew, however, that arbitration can be required only if both parties agree in advance that a court is the proper forum to resolve issues about the applicability of arbitration or the appropriateness of an arbitrator, and that since 1996 the Department of the Treasury, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had decided it is ""well established"" that national banks can issue credit cards. Relying on Mr. Hawkins's representations, numerous credit-card debtors paid a fee and applied to the program through these websites. The debtors were then referred to a private arbitration service organized to facilitate the program.In 2003, Mr. Hawkins set up Commercial Arbitration Forum, Inc. (CAFI), a Washington not-for-profit corporation. Mr. Hawkins was CAFI's sole shareholder and sole arbitrator. CAFI arbitrated matters referred to it by the aforementioned website businesses, which at the time needed a new arbitration service because prior arbitration services used by them had either been enjoined from issuing any further awards or had closed. Mr. Hawkins knew that CAFI would receive cases to arbitrate, because he endorsed the theory that a national banking association could not lend credit. CAFI arbitrations were conducted based only on documents mailed, faxed, or e-mailed to Mr. Hawkins by debtors using paperwork and briefing materials Mr. Hawkins had previously reviewed and modified on behalf of the website businesses. In conducting CAFI proceedings, Mr. Hawkins did not disclose to the debtors that he had a business relationship with the referring businesses. The first paragraph of each award signed by Mr. Hawkins stated, ""no known conflict of interest exists between the Commercial Arbitration Forum . . . and the Claimant or Respondent,"" though Mr. Hawkins paid substantial sums to the referring businesses. As CAFI's arbitrator, Mr. Hawkins found for the debtor 90 percent of the time. In all of those cases, the creditor defaulted. Mr. Hawkins did not disclose to debtors his role in developing the program materials that were submitted to him as arbitrator.In December 2003, Mr. Hawkins signed a CAFI arbitration award in favor of a claimant whose ""claim"" against a national bank was based on a debt owed under a line-of-credit agreement that did not contain an arbitration clause. In the arbitration award, Mr. Hawkins stated that ""Claimant alleges an agreement was entered into between the Parties to resolve disputes through arbitration."" Mr. Hawkins awarded the claimant $1,500 in attorney's fees and costs, even though the claimant appeared pro se, and he directed the bank to notify the three major credit bureaus that ""there is a zero balance owed"" by the claimant to the bank. As in all CAFI arbitrations, Mr. Hawkins relied on the sworn pleadings of the claimants, without either requiring additional proof of proper service of the arbitration demand on the national bank or reviewing the debtor's agreement with the bank to confirm it included an arbitration clause. He knew of no legal authority to support his position that one may go unilaterally to an arbitrator outside those specified in the credit-card agreement. The bank subsequently successfully sued the debtor on the debt.In an August 2003 letter, another national bank provided ""formal notice"" to Mr. Hawkins that they ""will not agree to arbitrate disputes before CAFI."" Nevertheless, after August 2003, Mr. Hawkins entered 177 ""awards"" in favor of the bank's debtors.After a debtor received an arbitration ""award,"" the program materials advised the debtor to confirm the award in court. ""Awards"" issued by Mr. Hawkins and CAFI were rejected by courts in several instances, and, in at least one case in which a debtor attempted to confirm such an award, the court awarded attorney's fees and costs to the bank. By the end of 2003, Mr. Hawkins stopped taking new cases for arbitration, although he continued to arbitrate cases already filed. In the end, he arbitrated over a thousand CAFI arbitrations, charging $139 per matter. Mr. Hawkins collected over $100,000 for issuing CAFI arbitration awards.In November 2003, a financial-services corporation obtained a temporary restraining order against CAFI and one of the corporation's debtors prohibiting them from conducting any more arbitrations in that debtor's case. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Hawkins sold the CAFI business and software to a non-lawyer friend, with payments to Mr. Hawkins tied to a percentage of income generated by the business (subsequently renamed ""SAG"") for as long as it maintained operations. In September 2004, a national bank filed for injunctive and declaratory relief in a Los Angeles County Superior Court against CAFI, SAG, and other so-called mailbox arbitration forums. CAFI defaulted. Eventually, the bank obtained a permanent injunction against CAFI, SAG, and other mailbox arbitration forums prohibiting any further arbitrations involving that bank's California customers.When an Idaho corporation attempted to confirm SAG arbitration awards that it had received through an assignment, a national bank counterclaimed for injunctive relief. In December 2004, SAG and its owner stipulated to and the court entered a permanent injunction in the Idaho case. Among other things, the order enjoined SAG from ""attempting in any manner to engage in arbitration or debt avoidance involving [the bank's] credit card customers through or in conjunction with any other entity or person . . . ."" In 2004, Mr. Hawkins began accepting cases referred to him by the aforementioned website businesses for the purpose of preparing materials for ""pro se"" debtors from various states. After a debtor submitted the application with a $200 ""advance retainer,"" he or she would be referred to Mr. Hawkins, who would then enter into a separate fee agreement with the debtor based on a percentage of the debt to be ""eliminated"" and the number of credit cards. The usual fee was about 10 percent of the amount of the debt. Mr. Hawkins would pay 10 percent of the fee to the referring website business. During 2003 and 2004, Mr. Hawkins collected about $200,000 under such fee agreements.In one instance, after assuring a debtor in Washington that the program was legal and (according to the debtor) that it was easy to get the awards confirmed in court, a debtor paid Mr. Hawkins over $5,700. Mr. Hawkins did not disclose his financial interest in SAG to the debtor. After receiving a number of SAG arbitration awards, the debtor was unable to confirm the awards in court and did not eliminate any credit-card debt. In at least two other cases in Washington, Mr. Hawkins appeared as the debtors' lawyer in superior court, attempting to rely on mailbox arbitration awards issued by SAG. Neither client in these two cases succeeded. Mr. Hawkins did not disclose to program participants his financial interest in SAG. Nor did he disclose that it was very rare for anyone following his program to achieve a zero balance or any reduction on their credit-card debt. Mr. Hawkins did not disclose to program participants that only about five percent of cases achieved the goal of having their accounts closed with a ""paid as agreed"" notation (and that he considered such cases ""a mistake on the part of the bank""). Mr. Hawkins did not disclose to program participants that program arbitrations produced favorable awards only by default, that as an arbitrator he did not review materials to ensure his jurisdiction over matters, or that he knew of no case decided in favor of a debtor when banks challenged the arbitration awards in court. Mr. Hawkins's conduct violated RPC 5.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from sharing legal fees with a nonlawyer; RPC 7.1(a) and (b), prohibiting a lawyer from making a false or misleading communication about the lawyer or the lawyer's services; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Linda B.

White (WSBA No. 14132, admitted 1984), of Seattle, was disbarred, effective February 3, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2005 leading to his conviction of the crime of money laundering. James L. White is to be distinguished from James A.D. White of Seattle and James J. White of Vashon.Mr. White was visited in his law office by a client who delivered to him a backpack containing approximately $100,000 in cash, packaged in bundles and held together by rubber bands. The currency was to be used in connection with the representation of the client. Mr. White was aware that the currency constituted proceeds derived from a conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. Â§ 846. Depositing the money into a bank account would have triggered the provisions of 31 U.S.C. Â§ 5313, a federal currency reporting requirement that requires a bank to file a report for cash deposits in excess of $10,000. In order to avoid the filing requirement, and to disguise the nature and source of the funds, Mr. White took the backpack containing the cash to his residence, where he kept it hidden. Thereafter, he expended the money in a variety of ways intended to further conceal and disguise the criminally derived nature and source of the funds, including delivering $20,000 in cash to another lawyer as a fee for that lawyer's representation of a co-conspirator in the client's case. Mr. White did not maintain records of receipt or expenditures of the funds.In July 2005, Mr. White pleaded guilty in federal district court to one count of money laundering, a violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1956(a)(1)(b)(i) and (ii).Mr. White's conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any unjustified act of assault or other act that reflects disregard for the rule of law, whether the same be committed in the course of his or her conduct as a lawyer, or otherwise, and whether the same constitutes a felony or misdemeanor or not.Christine Gray represented the Bar Association.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 2003 and 2004 involving lack of diligence and failure to communicate with clients.In August 2003, Mr. Vis was hired by a couple who had defaulted on payments to a bank holding a second-position deed of trust on their home. At the clients' request, Mr. Vis agreed to write to the bank to request that it forebear on foreclosing its interest in the property until the couple could sell some real property to satisfy the obligation. Mr. Vis never wrote to the bank. In August 2003, the couple received a summons and complaint in a separate collection action. Mr. Vis agreed to represent the clients and gather more information about the matter. Although he filed a notice of appearance on behalf of the clients in the proceeding, Mr. Vis never filed an answer to the complaint. In October 2003, Mr. Vis spoke with the counsel for the creditor to ask for verification of the debt, which was provided to him in May 2004. Mr. Vis did not provide this information to his clients. In June 2004, the counsel for the creditor filed a motion seeking an order of default and default judgment. The motion was scheduled for July. Mr. Vis was served with these documents, but he did not notify his clients about the motion or the hearing. Neither Mr. Vis nor his clients appeared for the hearing or otherwise responded to the motion. The creditor obtained a default judgment in the amount of $22,436.58 against Mr. Vis's clients.Mr. Vis's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; and RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

77.html,18356,Edward Parks,,Disbarment,10/29/1997,,"Kent lawyer Edward L. Parks (WSBA No. 18356, admitted 1988) has been ordered disbarred by order of the Supreme Court, effective October 29, 1997, after a default hearing and review by the Disciplinary Board. The discipline is based upon Parksâ€™ investment of a clientâ€™s money in a real estate development project in which others of Parksâ€™ clients and Parks himself had an interest, without properly advising the client about the risks of the investment or the conflicts of interest in such a transaction. Despite repeated requests, the clientâ€™s money was never returned to him.Parks represented a client in a variety of legal matters in the early 1990s. At all relevant times, Parks was aware that his client suffered from a drug problem which affected his understanding of legal matters and his ability to handle financial matters. During the course of the representation, the client inherited a house and more than $100,000 in cash. The client rapidly dissipated the cash, leaving the house as his only substantial asset. During the summer of 1994, the client asked Parks for help getting off drugs, and as part of his plan, the client decided to sell the house, put the proceeds in an account for his living expenses, and move to Mexico, where he could live more cheaply. The house was sold and over $72,000 in proceeds was placed in Parksâ€™ IOLTA trust account. Parks knew that this money represented the clientâ€™s entire assets, on which he hoped to be able to live for many years.Parks suggested that the client invest $40,000 in a real estate development project. Parks did not explain to the client that Parks represented the development company and its major shareholder personally, and that Parks himself was a shareholder and officer in the development company, and he did not explain the conflicts of interest inherent in these positions or obtain an informed written waiver of those conflicts. Parks also misrepresented the likely return from the investment in the project. At the time Parks suggested and made the investment, Parks knew that the project had not been able to secure complete financing, and that the purported owners of the land to be developed had pled guilty to and been sentenced for crimes arising from a land fraud scheme in another state. He also had written many letters to creditors of the development company for work on the project, putting off payment due to lack of financing.Parks wrote two checks from the clientâ€™s money in his IOLTA account, payable to the development companyâ€™s major shareholder personally (not the development company). The first check was for $40,000, and the second, of which the client was not informed until after the fact, was for $15,000. The project was never developed. Despite repeated requests to both Parks and the development company, and assurances from Parks that the money would be returned, the money has not been returned to the client.Parksâ€™ actions violated RPC 1.4(a) and (b) (requiring adequate communication with clients), RPC 1.7(a) and (b), RPC 1.8(a), and RPC 1.9 (dealing with conflicts of interest and business transactions with clients), and RPC 1.13(a) and (b) (regarding representing clients with disabilities), and his actions subject Parks to discipline pursuant to RLD 1.1(a) (for acts involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, and/or corruption), 1.1(c) (for violating his oath of attorney), 1.1(i) (for violating the RPCs), and 1.1(p) (for conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law).The hearing officer was Ronald J.

770.html,16645,Kim Comfort,,Suspension,8/17/2005,,"Kim Wallace Comfort (WSBA No. 16645, admitted 1987), of University Place, was suspended for 18 months, effective August 17, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct between 1999 and 2003 involving lack of diligence, failure to communicate with a client, and providing false documents and false information to a client.In 1999, Mr. Comfort represented a client in a personal injury claim. The client and Mr. Comfort entered into a contingent-fee agreement. From August 1999 through November 2002, Mr. Comfort told the client that he was diligently handling her claim when, in fact, he was not. In July 2002, one day before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, Mr. Comfort filed a complaint in the matter in Pierce County Superior Court. In October 2002, Mr. Comfort discovered that the summons and complaint had never been served on the defendants and that his client's lawsuit would be dismissed for failure to effect timely service of process. Mr. Comfort knew that the lawsuit's dismissal would preclude any recovery by his client, because the statute of limitations had expired. In order to conceal his error in failing to effect timely service, Mr. Comfort did not inform the client of the situation. In November 2002, Mr. Comfort contacted his client and falsely told her that he had settled the case for $14,750. Mr. Comfort fabricated the settlement to avoid telling his partners about the potential malpractice claim.  Mr. Comfort then fabricated settlement documents and paid the client $7,343.32, which he falsely stated was the client's share of the settlement proceeds. The settlement statement inaccurately reflected that Mr. Comfort had received $4,000 as his contingent fee. In April 2002, the lawyer for the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit for failure to effect service. Without his client's knowledge or authorization, Mr. Comfort signed and agreed to entry of a stipulation and order of dismissal. In March 2004, the client contacted Mr. Comfort inquiring about the unpaid PIP claim relating to her personal injury claim. Mr. Comfort falsely stated that the claim had been paid and apparently misapplied to the wrong account. After discovering that there was no settlement from her PIP carrier, the client confronted Mr. Comfort, who apologized and admitted there was no settlement. Mr. Comfort's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.Jonathan H.

Hopt (WSBA No. 12351, admitted 1982), of Seattle, was suspended for three years, effective August 17, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2002, 2003, and 2004 involving failure to act with diligence and promptness, failure to respond to client requests for information, failure to place client funds into his trust account, failure to explain the basis for his fee, failure to refund unearned fees, and failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation. In July 2002, Mr. Hopt agreed to complete a living trust for a husband and wife, who paid Mr. Hopt half of the total agreed fee of $1,500. There was no written fee agreement, and Mr. Hopt did not place the sum in his trust account. In October 2002, Mr. Hopt told the clients that he would forward to them a draft of the trust document for review. The clients never received the draft. Mr. Hopt neither responded to an e-mail request from the clients in December 2002 asking that he complete the work, nor to a certified letter from them in January 2003. Mr. Hopt did not respond to the couple's other additional efforts to reach him. The clients eventually consulted another lawyer who provided their estate planning services and documents.The clients filed a grievance with the Washington State Bar Association in 2004. During the course of the disciplinary investigation, Mr. Hopt failed to promptly respond to inquiries and requests for information submitted by disciplinary counsel. Prior to entry into the disciplinary stipulation, Mr. Hopt paid the clients $750 (without interest) as restitution.Mr. Hopt's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring that a lawyer act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring that a lawyer keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions; RPC 1.5(a), requiring that a lawyer's fees be reasonable; RPC 1.5(b) requiring that a lawyer who has not regularly represented a client communicate to the client the basis or rate of the fee or factors involved in determining the charges for legal services and the lawyer's billing practices; RPC 1.14(a) requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer be deposited into a trust account; RPC 1.15(d), requiring that a lawyer take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests, including refunding any advance fee payment that has not been earned; and RPC 8.4(1), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here, ELC 5.3(e)).Nancy Bickford Miller represented the Bar Association.

Wicks (WSBA No. 16950, admitted 1987), of Phoenix, Arizona, was ordered to receive a reprimand, effective January 31, 2005, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court imposing reciprocal discipline in accordance with an order of the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2003 involving trust account irregularities.In August 2003, the State Bar of Arizona received an insufficient-funds notice from Wells Fargo Bank regarding Mr. Wicks's client trust account. The notice indicated that a check in the amount of $190 had attempted to clear when the balance in Mr. Wicks's client trust account was only $169.55. Wells Fargo paid the check and charged a $29 overdraft fee, thereby overdrafting the trust account by $49.45. The State Bar of Arizona sent to Mr. Wicks a copy of the insufficient-funds notice with a letter requesting that he submit an explanation. Mr. Wicks explained that the overdraft was a result of a combination of bookkeeping and deposit errors. His explanation disclosed the following: â€¢ Believing that there was a possibility that he could be required to refund fees in three client matters, Mr. Wicks deposited ""earned-upon-receipt"" fees into his client trust account;â€¢ In one instance, Mr. Wicks erroneously deposited a $1,300 fee into his operating account instead of his client trust account. Mr. Wicks subsequently refunded $300 from the trust account to the client, not realizing that the offsetting funds were not on deposit in the client trust account, resulting in a $300 shortage;â€¢ In one instance, after accepting a $3,000 fee from a client, Mr. Wicks issued a trust-account check in the amount of $140 in payment of costs, but failed to record the disbursement in a check register. Mr. Wicks subsequently issued a partial refund of $1,000 to the client and a check to himself in the amount of $2,000. Mr. Wicks did not remember that he had previously issued a trust-account check for costs, resulting in a shortage of $140.In October 2003, the State Bar of Arizona requested additional information from Mr. Wicks. Mr. Wicks's response was incomplete, because his bookkeeping system was not properly maintained. Mr. Wicks was unable to completely account for the total balance of funds in the trust account and unclear as to the balance of any personal funds being maintained in the trust account to cover bank service charges. Available records reflected a total balance below what should have been in the account for three clients. Mr. Wick's conduct violated ER 1.15 of the Arizona Rules of Professional Conduct, requiring a lawyer to properly safeguard client funds, to keep the lawyer's funds separate from client funds on deposit in the trust account, and to maintain complete trust account records for a period of five years; Rule 43 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Arizona (Ariz. R. S. Ct.), requiring a lawyer to properly maintain complete trust account records for a period of five years, exercise due professional care and proper internal controls in the maintenance of client trust accounts, to record all transactions to the trust account promptly and completely, and to conduct a monthly reconciliation of the trust account as required by the rule; and Ariz.

Vaagen (WSBA No. 23016, admitted 1993), of Spokane, was ordered to receive a reprimand on November 29, 2005, following a stipulation approved by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on her conduct between 2003 and 2005 involving trust-account irregularities.In 2002, Ms. Vaagen stipulated to having negligently failed to maintain complete and accurate records of her trust account, depositing earned fees into the account, and failing to properly supervise her staff regarding her trust account. Ms. Vaagen received an admonition and was placed on probation requiring reexamination of her trust account by a WSBA auditor. Although Ms. Vaagen made efforts to correct her trust-account records, these efforts were unsuccessful in alleviating the chronically inadequate state of her records. Ms. Vaagen cooperated with a further examination of her trust-account records for 2005. The examination disclosed that at various points in 2003, 2004, and 2005, inadequate trust-account records were maintained, funds held on behalf of clients were advanced on behalf of other clients, funds were disbursed from the trust account before the underlying deposits had cleared the banking system, inactive and unclaimed funds were held in the accounts, and the account was not properly reconciled. As a result of these errors, a July 2005 reconciliation of the client ledgers resulted in a negative balance of $1,528.65. Although no evidence was found of clients losing money or any intentional misappropriation of funds, chronic errors in Ms. Vaagen's trust account records subjected clients to potential harm. Since June 2005, Ms. Vaagen has worked with a WSBA auditor to identify all funds in the trust account and has resolved all negative balance items in the account. In October 2005, Ms. Vaagen retained the services of an accountant to supervise the maintenance of her trust-account records and to perform on a monthly basis a reconciliation of the check register and the bank balance and a reconciliation of the client ledgers to the reconciled balance. Ms. Vaagen stipulated to a two-year period of probation, which includes periodic monitoring of her trust-account records by a WSBA auditor.Ms. Vaagen's conduct violated RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or a law firm be deposited into an interest-bearing trust account and that no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein; and RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to the client regarding them.Randy V.

776.html,26569,Victoria Smith,,Suspension,3/16/2006,,"Victoria N. Smith (WSBA No. 26569, admitted 1996), of Kirkland, was suspended for one year, effective March 16, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on her conduct between 2000 and 2004 in four matters involving, inter alia, lack of communication, lack of diligence, failure to communicate the basis or rate of her fee, trust-account irregularities, failure to comply with local court rules, and failure to cooperate with disciplinary investigations.Matter 1: Ms. Smith represented a client in connection with the dissolution of his marriage, which was finalized in August 2000. At the conclusion of the case, Ms. Smith did not file a notice of intent to withdraw. After the dissolution was finalized, the clientâ€™s ex-wife was involved in an accident while driving an automobile awarded to her under the terms of the dissolution. As a result, an insurance company attempted to collect from Ms. Smithâ€™s client. For approximately 16 months following the accident, the client tried to contact Ms. Smith to discuss the insurance problem, but Ms. Smith did not return his phone calls or respond to his efforts to contact her. Eventually, the client hired another lawyer to resolve the matter.Matter 2: In June 2001, Ms. Smith began representing a client in a dissolution proceeding. She had not previously represented the client in other matters. The fee agreement between Ms. Smith and the client provided that Ms. Smith would represent the client until entry of temporary orders for a flat fee of $2,500, which the client paid in early June. It also provided that Ms. Smith and the client would discuss further action and additional fees after the temporary orders were entered. After the court entered temporary orders in March 2002, Ms. Smith never discussed with the client how her fees would be calculated, but she continued to represent the client until a decree of dissolution was entered in May 2003. Also, in March 2002, the court awarded Ms. Smithâ€™s client $3,000 in legal fees, to be paid by the clientâ€™s husband. Without advising her client, Ms. Smith deposited the $3,000 into her trust account and disbursed $2,000 to herself as earned fees for the month of March, even though according to her own records she had earned less than $1,600 for her work during that month. During the nearly two years that she represented the client, Ms. Smith did not, prior to disbursing fees to herself from the trust account, provide the client with any accounting of time spent on the case or of fees earned.Matter 3: Ms. Smith represented a client whose dissolution decree was entered in February 2002. As part of the decree, the clientâ€™s wife was awarded a monetary judgment, of which $30,000 was to be paid from the clientâ€™s pension account. The decree required that Ms. Smith prepare and have her client execute a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) for the pension portion of the judgment within 10 days after entry of the decree, which Ms. Smith failed to do until six months later. In October 2002, Ms. Smith sent the wife a Release of Lien for her to sign. The release stated that the wife had received the full monetary judgment due her under the terms of the dissolution decree, even though Ms. Smith knew that the QDRO had not yet been entered in court and that the wife had not received the $30,000 payment from her clientâ€™s pension account. Ms. Smith failed to understand that if the wife signed the release, it could have prejudiced her ability to collect the money that had been awarded under the terms of the dissolution decree. The QDRO was ultimately entered by the court in October 2002, though the delay cost the wife an estimated $2,000 in interest.Matter 4: In 2002, Ms. Smith was hired to represent a client in a dissolution action that involved custody of the clientâ€™s seven-year-old son. In addition to paying Ms. Smithâ€™s fee, the client also paid to Ms. Smith $2,000 to hire a second parenting evaluator in addition to the one the court had appointed. The second evaluator was never hired, and Ms. Smith never gave the client an accounting of the money the client paid for the costs of the second evaluator, or any accounting for the work done or fees earned in representing the client. After a continuance had been granted due to Ms. Smithâ€™s discovery violations, a bench trial was conducted in August 2002, to decide the custody issues. At trial, Ms. Smith was precluded from calling any witnesses to testify on her clientâ€™s behalf because Ms. Smith had â€œwillfully violated court rules by disregarding four previous deadlines to disclose her witnesses.â€ As a result, Ms. Smithâ€™s client was the only witness allowed to testify on her behalf. At the conclusion of the trial, the court followed the recommendations of the court-appointed parenting evaluator, giving primary custody to the father and awarding Ms. Smithâ€™s client visitation rights. After the trial, the client made an effort to retain primary custody of her son by hiring new counsel and filing a motion to reopen the judgment and take additional testimony, but her motion was denied.Matter 5: Ms. Smith failed to cooperate in the investigation of the grievances filed in Matters 1, 2, and 3. Specifically, she failed to appear for her deposition on more than one occasion after being subpoenaed, failed to produce documents in a timely manner as she had agreed to do  under oath, and failed to answer written questions propounded to her. Ms. Smith did not cooperate in the investigation of two of the grievances until a petition for interim suspension based upon her noncooperation was filed by disciplinary counsel. Ms. Smithâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(b), requiring a lawyer who has not regularly represented a client to communicate to the client the basis or rate of the fee or factors involved in determining the charges for services and the lawyerâ€™s billing practices; RPC 1.14(a), requiring all funds of clients be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein; RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding all client funds and other properties; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here, ELC 1.5 and 5.3(e)) in connection with a disciplinary matter.Natalea Skvir represented the Bar Association.

777.html,4977,Graeme Strickland,,Suspension,3/16/2006,,"Graeme H. Strickland Jr. (WSBA No. 4977, admitted 1973), of Lake Oswego, Oregon, was suspended for one year, effective March 16, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court imposing reciprocal discipline in accordance with an order of the Supreme Court of the State of Oregon following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2003 involving criminal convictions for improper use of the emergency reporting system, initiating a false report, and disorderly conduct.In August 2002, Mr. Strickland learned that the city of Lake Oswego was planning to build a reservoir across the street from his home. For a time, Mr. Stickland observed the construction workers, took pictures, and recorded notes in a journal. Mr. Strickland subsequently sent several letters to the cityâ€™s attorney and the cityâ€™s contractor to put them â€œon noticeâ€ of a potential tort claim. Mr. Strickland wrote at least 10 separate letters, complaining of disturbances from the construction workers and claiming that the construction workers were â€œretaliating against him.â€ In March 2003, Mr. Strickland felt vibrations in his home that he associated with the construction site. He drove his car near the construction site and parked in the middle of an intersection. A construction worker asked him to move the car because he was parked in a work zone. Rather than move his car, Mr. Strickland left it in the intersection and walked back to his home, where he dialed 911. He asked the dispatcher to send the police because he was surrounded by construction vehicles and being threatened. Mr. Strickland then returned to the intersection, and lunged at one of the construction workers. Although no physical contact occurred, Mr. Strickland fell backwards to the ground and began screaming that his back was injured. A Lake Oswego police officer arrived. Mr. Strickland told the officer that the construction worker had assaulted him and thrown him to the ground. The officer notified Mr. Strickland that making a false report is a criminal act, but Mr. Strickland persisted in his story and refused to leave. Paramedics arrived and Mr. Strickland told them that the construction worker had assaulted him. Mr. Strickland then appeared to have a seizure, stiffening and trembling. Immediately thereafter, he sat up, appeared alert, and said that he was going home. Although the attending paramedic believed that Mr. Strickland had feigned the seizure, the paramedics transported Mr. Strickland to the emergency room because he continued to state that he was in pain. There, doctors found no evidence of physical injury. In connection with these events, Mr. Strickland was charged with and convicted by a jury of three misdemeanors in Lake Oswego Municipal Court: violation of ORS 165.570, improper use of emergency reporting system; ORS 162.375, initiating a false report; and ORS 166.025, disorderly conduct. Mr. Stricklandâ€™s conduct violated Oregon DR 1-102(A)(2), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness to practice law; and DR 1-102(A)(3), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.

This discipline is based on her practicing law while her license was suspended.Matter 1: On June 18, 1996, a client went to Ms. Kolihaâ€™s home office and requested that she appear at a hearing for her the next day. Ms. Koliha prepared pleadings that evening and appeared in court the next day to represent the client. In August 1996, opposing counsel filed a motion requesting an order requiring Ms. Kolihaâ€™s client to produce discovery. Ms. Koliha delivered the discovery answers and documents to opposing counselâ€™s office before the date of the hearing. Opposing counsel did not strike the hearing, because counsel believed that the discovery was incomplete, nor did she tell Ms. Koliha that she had not stricken the motion.The arbitrator entered an order finding Ms. Kolihaâ€™s absence ""unexcused,"" imposing sanctions of $150 each against Ms. Koliha and the client, and rescheduling the arbitration. Opposing counsel filed a motion in superior court to have Ms. Koliha and her client held in contempt for failing to provide complete discovery and failing to appear at the prior hearing. Ms. Koliha did not inform her client of this motion. Between September 16 and September 24, 1996, the client was not able to reach Ms. Koliha. On September 26, 1996, the client asked Ms. Koliha to return the clientâ€™s original financial documents. Ms. Koliha told the client that she had produced the original documents to opposing counsel.Matter 2: Client X divorced two abusive husbands and then changed her name and the names of her children to prevent her former husbands from locating her. Although the clientâ€™s Office of Support Enforcement (OSE) file was marked confidential, the office twice disclosed her new identity to her former husbands.The Northwest Womenâ€™s Law Center referred client X to Ms. Koliha regarding her claim that OSE wrongfully revealed her identity. In April 1995, Ms. Koliha agreed to investigate the case, pro bono, and possibly file a negligence action. On August 30, 1995, the client signed a contingent fee agreement with Ms. Koliha. From June through November 1996, the client was not able to reach Ms. Koliha. In November or December 1996, shortly after discovering that Ms. Koliha had never filed suit against OSE, client X retained another lawyer.Ms. Kolihaâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; and 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep their clients informed about the status of their cases and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.Leslie Allen represented the Bar Association.

780.html,29360,Eric Hoort,,Reprimand,9/2/2005,,"Eric C. Hoort (WSBA No. 29360, admitted 1999), of Seattle, was ordered to receive a reprimand on September 2, 2005, following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2002 involving failure to commence an action prior to expiration of the statute of limitations.At a meeting on June 15, 2002, a client hired Mr. Hoort to represent him in a wrongful termination matter. The client's employment had been terminated for being absent without leave after his arrest and incarceration for attempted murder. The client was ultimately acquitted of the attempted murder charge and released from custody. While still incarcerated, the client had sent a letter to his union explaining that the termination was not justified and requesting that the union file a grievance on his behalf. By letter dated January 15, 2002, the union replied that it would not pursue a grievance relating to the termination. At the June 15 meeting, the client paid Mr. Hoort $200 and gave him a file containing documents relating to the dispute, including a copy of the January 15 letter from the union.Mr. Hoort knew that the statute of limitations for a ""hybrid"" action brought against an employer and a union is six months, beginning from when the employee first knew or should have known the union would not grieve the termination. At the latest, the six-month limitation period on the client's claim would run no later than mid-July 2002. Mr. Hoort neither clearly advised the client of the date on which the statute would run nor calendared a date for the expiration of the limitation period. Mr. Hoort did not write any letters to the client's former employer or the union, and he did not file a lawsuit on the client's behalf. In August 2002, the client sent to Mr. Hoort $500. In September 2002, the client wrote a letter to Mr. Hoort inquiring about the status of the case. By letter dated October 4, 2002, Mr. Hoort replied that, after extensive research, he had determined that the limitation period had lapsed some four months prior to the client contacting his office and, as a result, he would not be able to pursue a wrongful termination action on the client's behalf. Enclosed with the letter were file materials and a money order for $500. Mr. Hoort's statement in the October 4 letter about the timing of the expiration of the statute of limitations was incorrect. Mr. Hoort's conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; and RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client.

781.html,22465,Donna Light,,Disbarment,3/29/2006,,"Donna J. Light (WSBA No. 22465, admitted 1993), of Renton, was disbarred, effective March 29, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on her conduct between 2003 and 2005 in multiple matters.Ms. Lightâ€™s conduct establishing grounds for discipline included the following:â€¢ Failing to competently and diligently represent clients in 16 matters, including failing to timely file pleadings and other paperwork, failing to adequately review the contents of and correct inaccuracies in filed pleadings, failing to perform adequate research, failing to prepare for or appear at hearings and trials, and failing to appear for scheduled meetings with clients.â€¢ Filing bankruptcy schedules, a bankruptcy plan, and other pleadings known to Ms. Light to contain false and misleading information in violation of 11 U.S.C. Â§152; filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan for a client without the clientâ€™s knowledge or consent; and filing bankruptcy schedules and a statement of financial affairs that were never reviewed by the clients.â€¢ Failing to keep clients informed about the status of their cases, failing to maintain an adequate telephone system or address where clients and opposing counsel could reach her, disregarding telephone messages and letters from clients requesting information about their cases, and intentionally concealing her whereabouts from clients.â€¢ Charging unreasonable fees for the amount of work performed, failing to refund unearned fees to clients after having failed to provide legal services, and failing to return documents or files upon client request following termination of representation.â€¢ Losing or destroying most or all of a client file in a bankruptcy matter.â€¢ Misrepresenting case status to clients, falsely representing to clients that she would refile or had already filed pleadings when she had not, deceptively promising to refund fees as a means to lure clients into rehiring her, and deceptively obtaining fees from clients without intending to perform legal services for them (constituting theft by deception).â€¢ In connection with the disciplinary investigation and proceeding, failing to attend a scheduled deposition and failing to deliver client files and records to disciplinary counsel as required by a scheduling order and an order to compel.In February 2005, Ms. Light was personally served with an order to show cause issued by the Washington State Supreme Court. The order directed Ms. Light to appear in March before the Washington State Supreme Court, which she failed to do. In March 2005, the Supreme Court issued an order immediately suspending Ms. Light from the practice of law. Disciplinary counsel sent Ms. Light a notice of duties upon suspension pursuant to ELC 14.1. Ms. Light continued to engage in the practice of law and failed to comply with the duties upon suspension, which included notifying all clients of the suspension, notifying the tribunal of the inability to act in pending matters, filing an affidavit of compliance, and returning unearned fees and client files.Ms. Lightâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.2(d), prohibiting a lawyer from counseling a client to engage, or assisting a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fees to be reasonable; 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests upon termination of representation; RPC 3.1, prohibiting a lawyer from bringing or defending a proceeding, or asserting or controverting an issue therein, unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous; RPC 5.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction where doing so violates the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction; RPC 8.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(j), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order directing him or her to do or cease doing an act which he or she ought in good faith to do or forbear; RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here, ELC 1.5, 10.11(g), 14.1(a) and (c), 14.2, and 14.3); and RPC 8.4(n), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law.Jonathan H.

782.html,373,Norman Cohen,,Disbarment,3/29/2006,,"Norman W. Cohen (WSBA No. 373, admitted 1965), of Seattle, was disbarred, effective March 29, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 1998 and 2000 involving failure to abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation, lack of diligence, failure to communicate with the client, and improperly attempting to withdraw from a representation.In April 1998, a client hired Mr. Cohen to commence a lawsuit in an employment matter. Mr. Cohen filed the lawsuit, and trial was initially set for September 1999. At a pretrial conference in July 1999, Mr. Cohen and the defendants' lawyer stipulated to transfer the case to mandatory arbitration. Mr. Cohen neither informed his client about the pretrial conference nor explained to him what mandatory arbitration meant. The arbitration was set for December 1999. Rule 5.2 of the Mandatory Arbitration Rules (MAR) required Mr. Cohen to file a pre-hearing statement of proof 14 days before the arbitration, which he failed to do. Citing MAR 5.2, the defendants requested that Mr. Cohen's client be barred from presenting testimony or evidence at the hearing. Mr. Cohen responded to the request by faxing a very brief pre-hearing statement to the defendants' lawyer and the arbitrator. Mr. Cohen also faxed a letter to the arbitrator stating that he had no excuse for failing to file the pre-hearing statement. Because of his failure to file a pre-hearing statement, Mr. Cohen agreed in a pre-arbitration conference call with opposing counsel and the arbitrator to allow the entry of an award in the defendants' favor as long as it stated that there was no finding that Mr. Cohen's client failed to participate in the hearing. Mr. Cohen did not consult with his client or obtain client's consent to entry of an arbitration award in the defendants' favor. Mr. Cohen told his client that the arbitration had been cancelled because opposing counsel was sick. The arbitrator entered the award and Mr. Cohen filed a request for trial de novo. Mr. Cohen did not inform his client that, by filing a request for trial de novo, the client could be liable under MAR 7.3 for the defendants' costs and attorney's fees incurred after filing such a request. In March 2000, the defendants' lawyer offered to settle the case for $2,000. Although Mr. Cohen's office forwarded a copy of the offer to the client, Mr. Cohen did not respond to the offer. A trial date was set for November 6, 2000, and a scheduling order was issued by the court requiring disclosure of primary witnesses and exhibits by June 5, 2000, and exchange of witness lists by October 16, 2000. Although the client had provided Mr. Cohen with one or more lists of witnesses shortly after hiring him, and had updated the information prior to the arbitration date, Mr. Cohen failed to contact the witnesses, including a witness that the client considered critical to the case. During a telephonic pretrial conference on October 13, 2000, the court ordered Mr. Cohen to communicate a settlement offer to the defense attorney that day, to arrange a mediation by October 20, and to exchange witness and exhibit lists by October 23. The court subsequently memorialized this in a written order. Mr. Cohen failed to do any of these things. On October 13, 2000, the defendants' lawyer offered to settle the case for $1,000. Although Mr. Cohen's office forwarded a copy of the offer to the client, Mr. Cohen again did not respond to the offer. The defendants' lawyer called Mr. Cohen's office on three different occasions, but did not receive any return calls. On October 24, he faxed Mr. Cohen a letter informing him that he would be requesting exclusion of witnesses and exhibits because Mr. Cohen had not complied with the pretrial order. On October 26, the defendants' lawyer filed a motion to exclude evidence and to dismiss the case with prejudice. On November 1, 2000, five days before trial, without having informed his client of his intentions, Mr. Cohen filed a motion seeking to withdraw on short notice. On the day before trial, Mr. Cohen's secretary informed the client that Mr. Cohen was in the process of withdrawing from the case. The client attempted to find another lawyer to represent him, but none of those he contacted were willing to take on the case so soon before the trial. On November 7, the court held a hearing on the pending motions. The court denied Mr. Cohen's motion to withdraw as untimely and granted the defense counsel's motion to exclude evidence, permitting only limited testimony. After hearing this limited testimony, the court entered a judgment for the defendants and a judgment against Mr. Cohen's client for $8,118.75 in attorney fees. Throughout the representation, Mr. Cohen had not telephoned or in any way communicated with the client regarding key issues in the case, and he did not return the client's phone calls.Mr. Cohen's conduct violated RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation and to consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.15, governing the circumstances in which a lawyer may withdraw from representation; and RPC 8.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct.Anne I.

Goyak (WSBA No. 15289, admitted 1985), of McMinnville, Oregon, was suspended for six months, effective April 5, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court imposing reciprocal discipline in accordance with an order of the Supreme Court of the State of Oregon. This discipline is based on his conduct between 1998 and 2000 involving the crime of negotiating a bad check, trust-account irregularities, and failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation.In July 1998, after experiencing financial difficulties, Mr. Goyak, a solo practitioner, stopped practicing law regularly. His income became irregular, and he would often meet his obligations with loans from family members and business associates. Between April 1998 and April 1999 Mr. Goyak wrote four checks payable to the City of Portland on his business and personal accounts. Mr. Goyak knew that he had insufficient funds in these accounts to cover the checks. City employees contacted Mr. Goyak about his delinquent account several times, both by telephone and by personally delivering bills. Each time, Mr. Goyak promised to pay, but failed to keep his promises. Thereafter, Mr. Goyak failed to respond to several attempts by the city to contact him, and his account was sent to the City Attorneyâ€™s Office for formal collection. It was not until after the City Attorneyâ€™s Office complained to the Oregon State Bar and threatened litigation that Mr. Goyak settled his account.When the Oregon State Bar received the complaint from the City Attorneyâ€™s Office, disciplinary counsel attempted unsuccessfully to make contact with Mr. Goyak six times between March and August 2000. During the investigation of the complaint, Mr. Goyak did not produce requested records for over a year, and disciplinary counsel was ultimately required to subpoena them from Mr. Goyakâ€™s bank. Mr. Goyak admitted that, between 1998 and 2000, he deposited his personal funds into his trust account, used the account as a personal bank account, and failed to keep or maintain adequate records of his trust account transactions.Mr. Goyakâ€™s conduct violated Oregon DR 1-102(A)(2), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, negotiating bad checks) that reflects adversely on a lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness to practice law; DR 1-103(C), requiring a lawyer who is the subject of a disciplinary hearing to respond fully and truthfully to inquiries from and comply with reasonable requests of a tribunal or other authority empowered to investigate or act upon the conduct of lawyers; DR 9-101(A), requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited or maintained in one or more identifiable trust accounts and that no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein; DR 9-101(C)(3), requiring a lawyer to promptly notify a client of the receipt of the client funds, securities, or other properties; identify and label securities or other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and place them in a safe deposit box or other place of safe keeping as soon as is practicable; maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to the lawyerâ€™s client regarding them; and promptly pay or deliver to a client as requested by the client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive.Felice P.

This discipline was based on his conduct between 1997 and 2000 in multiple client matters.     Between August 1997 and January 2000, Mr. Cochran engaged in the following conduct that established grounds for discipline:â€¢ Misrepresenting to a client that he had commenced a lawsuit on her behalf;â€¢ In three instances, failing to prepare and file documents in dissolution cases;â€¢ In two instances, misrepresenting to clients that court hearings had been scheduled when they had not;â€¢ In 18 instances, failing to communicate to clients by not responding to messages and reasonable requests for information;â€¢ In 11 instances, failing to take any action to further clientâ€™s cases;â€¢ In 13 instances, accepting client payments, failing to perform the agreed upon services, and retaining possession of and misappropriating the money for his own use; â€¢ In 13 instances, failing to refund unreasonable and unearned fees to clients and failing to account to clients regarding their funds;â€¢ In 11 instances, failing to return client files to clients upon request;â€¢ Failing to provide requested information to the Bar Association and failing to appear at a deposition in the course of the ensuing disciplinary investigation.

787.html,17382,Randy Durham,,Suspension,4/14/2006,,"Randy L. Durham (WSBA No. 17382, admitted 1987), of Tacoma, was suspended for two years, effective April 14, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct in three matters between 2000 and 2004 involving lack of diligence, failure to abide by a clientâ€™s decision concerning the objective of representation, filing a non-meritorious claim, and misrepresentations to clients.Matter 1: Between 1997 and 2004, Mr. Durham represented a sheet-metal business. In January 1999, Mr. Durham commenced an action on behalf of the client to recover damages resulting from a breach of contract and to foreclose on a bond and retainage fund. The named defendants in the action included a general contractor, a governmental entity, and a bonding company. In October 2000, the presiding judge partially granted the clientâ€™s motion for summary judgment, awarding the client $5,500 against the retainage fund. No order was signed at the time of the hearing. In November 2000, Mr. Durham sent the general contractorâ€™s lawyer a proposed order for signature. The order was never signed and returned, but Mr. Durham did not pursue the matter further. In December 2001, the general contractor made an offer to settle all claims for $11,997.62. Mr. Durham did not respond to the offer. For a period of approximately two years, during which there was little activity on the case, Mr. Durham repeatedly misled the client about the status of the matter. In October 2002, the general contractor offered to settle for $13,727.48. Mr. Durham communicated the offer to the client, who told him to counter-offer $15,000. Mr. Durham instead counter-offered $17,003.48. The parties failed to reach a settlement. In November 2002, Mr. Durham filed a second motion for summary judgment seeking the identical relief sought in the October 2000 motion. As a result, the judge signed the order that Mr. Durham had prepared and circulated in November 2000.Matter 2: Mr. Durhamâ€™s client was hired by a general contractor to install metal sidings at a construction project for a university. The client did not receive full payment for its services. In May 2000, Mr. Durham commenced an action on the clientâ€™s behalf, naming the contractor, the bond, and the university as defendants. The bonding company tendered defense of the claim to the general contractor. In June 2001, Mr. Durham negotiated a settlement that included a â€œJoint Pursuit of Claimsâ€ agreement, under which Mr. Durhamâ€™s client obtained $40,446.49, assigned $25,000 of its claims against the university to the contractor and the bonding company, waived and released its claims against the bonding company and the university, and agreed to dismiss the contractor and the bonding company from the lawsuit. Mr. Durham advised the client to sign the agreement, erroneously assuring him that it would not jeopardize the clientâ€™s right to collect additional damages. In July 2001, in accordance with the settlement, Mr. Durham filed the stipulation and order voluntarily dismissing the contractor and the bonding company from the case. The client did not recover any damages above the amount paid pursuant to the agreement.The client subsequently expressed dissatisfaction about the outcome of the lawsuit. Mr. Durham suggested that the client file a suit to void the agreement on the basis of fraudulent inducement. In August 2002, Mr. Durham filed a second suit against the contractor, the bonding company, and the university. Lawyers for the bonding company and the university requested that Mr. Durham voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit for a number of reasons. Despite being notified that the bonding company would seek attorneyâ€™s fees and costs for a frivolous lawsuit, Mr. Durham did not dismiss either party. In March 2003, Mr. Durham advised the client that he would file a motion for default â€œto focus the court on our request for Arbitration.â€ In fact, no request for arbitration had ever been filed, the relief sought in the complaint exceeded the jurisdictional requirement for mandatory arbitration, and there was no contractual basis for arbitration.  In September and October 2003, all defendants filed motions for summary judgment. Mr. Durham erroneously advised the client that the defendantsâ€™ chances for success were â€œnominalâ€ and that the universityâ€™s motion was baseless. The court granted the defendantsâ€™ motions, noting in its order that the claims against the bonding company and the bond were frivolous in their entirety. The order included an award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs against Mr. Durhamâ€™s client under the frivolous claims statute. When the client told Mr. Durham that he was shocked to find out the lawsuit was frivolous, Mr. Durham told the client that he would pay the award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, which he did not immediately do.Mr. Durham told the client that it was still possible to execute on the default judgment obtained in the first lawsuit. In fact, this course of action was not viable, because the client had waived such a remedy when it settled and voluntarily dismissed the general contractor from the first lawsuit in July 2001. In February and March 2004, Mr. Durham repeatedly misled the client about the status of the matter. In March 2004, the bonding company garnished the clientâ€™s bank account to recover the attorneyâ€™s fees and costs previously assessed. In April 2004, Mr. Durham attempted to pay the fees and costs with his credit card, but the bonding companyâ€™s law firm was not set up to process credit cards and requested a check. Three weeks later, the bonding company again garnished the clientâ€™s bank account. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Durham mailed a check that fully satisfied the judgment.Matter 3: In March 2000, in an unrelated matter, the CEO of the sheet-metal business asked Mr. Durham to investigate and pursue claims against the CEOâ€™s business partner for breach of an agreement. Mr. Durham came to the conclusion that the CEO had no viable claims against the business partner because, among other reasons, the statute of limitations for such an action had already passed. He failed, however, to advise the CEO about this conclusion. The CEO believed Mr. Durham was actively pursuing the claims.

788.html,17041,Barbara Varon,,Reprimand,8/4/2005,,"Barbara E. Varon (WSBA No. 17041, admitted 1987), of Bellevue, was ordered to receive a reprimand, effective August 4, 2005, following a hearing. This discipline was based on her conduct involving failure to advise a tribunal of all relevant facts in an ex parte proceeding and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.In May 2000, Ms. Varon was hired to represent a client in a child-custody and visitation-rights matter involving the clientâ€™s son, who resided in Snohomish County with the clientâ€™s ex-wife pursuant to a parenting plan filed six years earlier in a King County dissolution action. The client advised Ms. Varon that the son was undergoing psychiatric treatment at a hospital in King County. Shortly after Ms. Varon was hired, the clientâ€™s ex-wife, acting pro se, obtained a temporary order for protection from the Snohomish County Superior Court (Snohomish County TRO). The Snohomish County TRO provided, inter alia, that the King County parenting plan was temporarily suspended, and that the client was restrained from having contact with his ex-wife and his two children except as authorized by the sonâ€™s psychiatrist. The clientâ€™s ex-wife then hired a lawyer, who notified Ms. Varon that he would be representing the ex-wife. The lawyerâ€™s letter to Ms. Varon stated that â€œ[t]he purpose of this letter is hopefully to ensure that there is no disruption to the treatment plan devised for [the son] by the doctors and social workers ....â€ After receiving the letter, Ms. Varon told her client that she would not contact opposing counsel until after she had obtained a restraining order against the clientâ€™s ex-wife. Ms. Varon then filed a petition seeking modification of the parenting plan in King County Superior Court. Among other things, the petition sought to name Ms. Varonâ€™s client as the primary residential parent for his son. Two days later, without notifying opposing counsel or the ex-wife of the hearing, Ms. Varon sought an ex parte temporary order to restrain the ex-wife from contacting her son. Ms. Varon believed that irreparable injury could result if the ex-wife was given notice of the proceeding. Ms. Varon also believed that the ex-wife was evading service. In support of the request, Ms. Varon submitted 84 pages of documents to the court, which included a copy of the Snohomish County TRO and opposing counselâ€™s letter announcing his representation. However, due to the exigencies of the ex parte calendar, the commissioner only skimmed through the exhibits, relying (pursuant to his established practice) on counsel to advise him orally of all relevant facts to permit him to render an informed decision. Ms. Varon did not orally inform the commissioner of the existence of the prior Snohomish County TRO, nor did she inform the commissioner that the opposing party was represented by counsel. Had she done so, the commissioner would have followed his usual practice and contacted the issuing court and the opposing counsel for a response prior to making his ruling. The commissioner issued the order (King County TRO) as requested by Ms. Varon, giving her client custody of his son and prohibiting the ex-wife from interfering with that custody or entering the clientâ€™s home or workplace, or his sonâ€™s daycare or school. Soon thereafter, to resolve the two conflicting orders, Ms. Varon and the ex-wifeâ€™s lawyer appeared before a King County commissioner at an emergency hearing, after which the King County TRO order was vacated. The lawyers also appeared before a Snohomish County commissioner at hearings in May and June. As a result, the Snohomish County TRO was vacated and the cause of action dismissed. The clientâ€™s King County petition for modification of the parenting plan was ultimately granted in the clientâ€™s favor.Ms. Varonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 3.3(f), requiring a lawyer in an ex parte proceeding to inform the tribunal of all relevant facts known to the lawyer that should be disclosed to permit the tribunal to make an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Natalea Skvir represented the Bar Association.

790.html,17151,Andrew Gala,,Disbarment,4/20/2006,,"Andrew R. Gala (WSBA No. 17151, admitted 1987), of Seattle, was disbarred, effective April 20, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2000 and 2003 involving misappropriation of law-firm funds, entering into loan transactions with a client without adequate disclosure or written consent, and other conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Mr. Gala worked at the Seattle branch of a law firm based in Portland, Oregon. By 2002, Mr. Gala managed the firmâ€™s Seattle office and was able to approve certain expenditures without further authorization. The firmâ€™s Shareholder Compensation Plan in effect during Mr. Galaâ€™s association with it specified that â€œeach Shareholder shall devote his or her entire time and attention to the practice of law for the benefit and account of the Corporation. No Shareholder shall engage in the practice of law other than for the benefit and account of the Corporation.â€ Mr. Gala was the primary billing attorney assigned to all matters involving Client A. Mr. Gala also represented multiple clients in a matter known as the consolidated claims litigation, which had generated large fees over several years.Matter 1: At intervals in 2002 and 2003, Mr. Gala asked his secretary to obtain three checks (totaling $12,300) for payments to a purported expert witness. Mr. Gala denominated the checks as cost items related to the consolidated claims litigation. The checks, signed by Mr. Gala, were actually made out to Mr. Galaâ€™s personal creditor and used to pay a debt owed following Mr. Galaâ€™s purchase of a residence on Mercer Island. To explain to the creditor why the check had been drawn on a firm account, Mr. Gala claimed that his firm had set up an escrow account for him. When the firmâ€™s accounting department asked for the expertâ€™s tax identification number (TIN), Mr. Gala concealed the fact that he was using firm funds to discharge a personal debt by providing the accounting department with an unwitting third partyâ€™s Social Security number. At the end of 2002, the firm completed an IRS 1099 form listing the $12,300 as income to the â€œexpert witnessâ€ paid by the firm. Sometime in 2003, the firm received notice from the IRS that the TIN it had provided for the â€œexpert witnessâ€ did not match IRS records. Consequently, the firm sent a notice to Mr. Galaâ€™s creditor requesting that he complete a form with his correct TIN. Upon receipt of the notice, an assistant in the creditorâ€™s office contacted the firm and explained that their only connection with Mr. Gala was through a purely personal debt for the purchase of his home. The firmâ€™s accounting department gathered information about the three checks and learned that Social Security number for the TIN did not in fact belong to an â€œexpert witness.â€ The accounting department determined that firm clients had contributed $10,455 towards Mr. Galaâ€™s house payment, while Mr. Gala had caused the firm to absorb the remaining $1,845 as part of a write-off. The firmâ€™s president immediately communicated with the affected clients and sent checks to reimburse those clients for the â€œexpert fees.â€Matter 2: In April 2003, Mr. Gala applied to rent an apartment for himself. He listed the firm name as well as his own as the â€œapplicant.â€ He directed his paralegal to request a check for $3,825, payable to the entity renting the property, to be drawn on the firmâ€™s client advance account and chargeable to Client A for a â€œproperty purchaseâ€ matter. Mr. Gala identified the reason for the â€œclient advanceâ€ as a â€œco-brokerage fee.â€ The firmâ€™s accounting department prepared the check drawn on the firmâ€™s Seattle client advance account. Mr. Gala signed the check and used it to prepay rent on the apartment. Mr. Gala listed the check as a cost item on a Client A matter. He asked the firmâ€™s accounting department to transfer fees and costs in that matter to a new probate file, which would not be subject to the firmâ€™s 60-day billing requirement. Matter 3: In June 2000, Mr. Gala signed a $100,000 promissory note to Client A for money that Client A had loaned to Mr. Gala. In approximately February 2002, Client A loaned Mr. Gala an additional $25,000. Mr. Gala did not provide written disclosure to, and did not obtain written waivers or consents from, Client A regarding potential conflicts of interest. After signing the promissory note, Mr. Gala provided over 200 hours of legal services to Client A for which he did not bill Client A in order to retire all or part of his debt. Under the terms of the firmâ€™s shareholder agreement, the firm, not Mr. Gala, was entitled to receive the value of the legal services provided by Mr. Gala to Client A. Mr. Gala also charged expenses for trips to California and Arizona on Client A matters to the firm, but did not bill Client A for those expenses. After discovering the situation and investigating further, the firm took prompt action to terminate its relationship with Mr. Gala.Mr. Galaâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to another client or to a third person or by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after a full disclosure of material facts; RPC 1.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer from entering into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquiring an ownership, possessory, security, or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless the transaction and its terms are fair and reasonable and fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client, the client is given opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel, and the client consents; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, corruption, or any unjustified act of assault or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law, whether the same be committed in the course of his or her conduct as a lawyer, or otherwise; and former RLD 1.1(a), prohibiting acts involving moral turpitude and acts reflecting disregard for the rule of law.Linda B.

793.html,3418,L. Hanson,,Reprimand,10/18/2005,,"L. Eugene Hanson (WSBA No. 3418, admitted 1968), of Goldendale, was ordered to receive a reprimand on October 18, 2005, following a stipulation approved by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on his conduct between 1997 and 2005 involving lack of diligence, failure to communicate with a client, and trust-account irregularities.In 1996, Mr. Hanson was hired to handle a real estate matter involving a client seeking assistance with a parcel of property located in White Salmon. At the time, Mr. Hanson maintained offices in both White Salmon and Goldendale. He agreed to take the necessary probate action to establish clear title to the property. Between 1996 and 1997, Mr. Hanson actively worked on the matter, but activity was interrupted in early 1997 when out-of-state witnesses failed to sign and return necessary affidavits. Later in 1997, Mr. Hanson closed his White Salmon office, consolidating it into the Goldendale office. At that time, the client's file was misplaced with closed files from the White Salmon office. Mr. Hanson took no further action in the case until after the client filed a disciplinary grievance in November 2002. In the interim, the client repeatedly called Mr. Hanson to inquire about the status of the matter. Although Mr. Hanson spoke to the client on some of these occasions, he did not locate the file, take further action on the matter, or properly advise the client as to the status of the matter. After the disciplinary grievance was filed, Mr. Hanson made a thorough search for the missing file and eventually located it. He filed a probate action in March 2003, and concluded the estate in October 2005 by establishing his client's ownership of the property.Prior to the closure of Mr. Hanson's White Salmon office, $970 of the client's funds were being held in Mr. Hanson's White Salmon trust account. In September 1997, Mr. Hanson transferred the balance of the White Salmon trust account into his Goldendale trust account, including the client's $970. Although Mr. Hanson closed out the client's White Salmon ledger, he failed to open a new client ledger for her in the records of his Goldendale trust account. He has never provided the client with a final accounting of the balance of her trust account funds. Mr. Hanson subsequently became aware that his combined trust account had an excess of funds. He consulted with his former bookkeeper to determine the reason for the discrepancy. They were unable to ascertain the reason for the excess but suspected that it was related to accounts acquired when Mr. Hanson had assumed the practice of a retiring lawyer. Mr. Hanson drew down the balance of the account so that the bank balance corresponded with what he believed were the client balances. As part of the investigation into the client's grievance, Mr. Hanson agreed to cooperate with an examination of his trust accounts. The WSBA auditor found that the reconciled bank balance exceeded the check register balance by $121.26 (reflecting a series of addition errors), that the client ledger accounts exceeded the reconciled bank balance by $1,793, that there were 20 client ledger accounts (totaling $1,965.93) that appeared to be inactive, and that failing to reconcile the client accounts with the reconciled bank balance had contributed to the account discrepancies. The auditor recommended, among other things, that Mr. Hanson restore the $1,793 to his trust account and seek to locate the clients to whom the $1,965.93 belong. Mr. Hanson agreed to comply with the auditor's recommendations.Mr. Hanson's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.14(a), requiring a lawyer to deposit all client funds into one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts; and RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the lawyer's possession and render appropriate accounts to the client regarding them.Randy V.

This discipline was based on her conduct between 2003 and 2005 involving lack of diligence, failure to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation, failure to provide an accounting, charging an unreasonable fee, and failure to refund unearned fees.In April 2003, Ms. Schwartz was hired by a client to provide representation in a dissolution action. The client specifically requested that Ms. Schwartz file a withdrawal of joinder and change of venue from Lincoln County to Skagit County. In May 2003, the client signed a â€œRetainer Agreementâ€ and paid Ms. Schwartz a $1,000 â€œminimum fee and retainer.â€ The agreement provided that Ms. Schwartzâ€™s hourly rate was $120 and that a portion of the â€œminimum fee and retainerâ€ could be refunded depending on the billings. In May 2003, Ms. Schwartz filed a notice of appearance and withdrawal of joinder. In July and September 2003, Ms. Schwartz wrote to her clientâ€™s estranged husband regarding a proposed property division and asked him to contact her. No other legal work was performed for the client. Between April and December 2003, the client called Ms. Schwartz weekly and spoke to Ms. Schwartz approximately five or six times. After December 2003, neither Ms. Schwartz nor anyone from Ms. Schwartzâ€™s office contacted the client. The clientâ€™s husband also contacted Ms. Schwartzâ€™s office on several occasions, but he was rarely able to speak to her. Ms. Schwartz made four appointments to speak with the husband regarding the dissolution, but Ms. Schwartz did not follow through on any of these appointments. The client hired a new lawyer to obtain the change of venue and to complete the dissolution. Despite multiple requests from the clientâ€™s new lawyer, Ms. Schwartz did not sign and return a substitution of counsel, provide an itemized billing, or refund any unearned fees to her client.Ms. Schwartzâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.2, requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions about the objectives of representation and to consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable; RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by a client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive; and RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

Kronenberg (WSBA No. 13979, admitted 1984), of Seattle, was suspended for two years, effective May 12, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on Mr. Kronenbergâ€™s conduct in 1996 involving a conflict of interest and refusal to refund the unearned portion of a fee. The stipulation incorporated by reference of the facts set forth in Cotton v. Kronenberg, 111 Wn. App. 258, 44 P.3d 878 (2002). Mr. Kronenberg was previously disbarred by Supreme Court order effective August 18, 2005. See In re Discipline of Kronenberg, 155 Wn.2d 184, 117 P.3d 1134 (2005).In March 1996, Mr. Kronenberg was hired by a client charged with three counts of felony rape of a child. The client signed a fee agreement prepared by Mr. Kronenberg which provided that attorney fees would be charged at the rate of $140 per hour. At the time, the client signed a statutory warranty deed granting a parcel of real property to Mr. Kronenberg. The client also transferred to Mr. Kronenberg title to a mobile home located on the property. A few days later, the client signed another agreement prepared by Mr. Kronenberg. The second agreement set forth the terms of a â€œnonrefundable feeâ€ for defense against the child rape charges. The agreement estimated that fees â€œcould be anywhere from $10,000 to $30,000.â€ The agreement further provided for the transfer of the realty and mobile home to Mr. Kronenberg in full satisfaction of all fees earned in the case. Within a week, Mr. Kronenberg recorded the deed, and within months he sold the property for $42,000.In July 1996, the trial court granted a motion by prosecutors to have Mr. Kronenberg removed from the case based on allegations of witness tampering. Thereafter, new counsel for the client negotiated a plea and sentence recommendation. As a result of these negotiations, no criminal charges went to trial. After Mr. Kronenbergâ€™s dismissal, the client requested a refund of the unearned balance of the fees generated by the sale of the realty and mobile home. Mr. Kronenberg denied the request.Mr. Kronenbergâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.5(a) requiring that a lawyerâ€™s fee be reasonable; RPC 1.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer from entering into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquiring an ownership, possessory, security or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless the transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client in a manner which can be reasonably understood by the client, the client is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel in the transaction, and the client consents thereto; and RPC 1.15(d), requiring that a lawyer take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests upon termination of representation, such as, inter alia, refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned.

This discipline was based on her conduct in 2004 and 2005 involving conflicts of interest and disclosure of confidential information.In 2004, Ms. Bowker was engaged to represent the lender in a loan transaction. The borrower in the transaction was Ms. Bowkerâ€™s former client in an estate-planning matter. The lender was the mother of the former client. Ms. Bowker believed that she was representing only the lender. However, based upon Ms. Bowkerâ€™s prior lawyer-client relationship with the borrower, meetings she had had with the borrower regarding the loan, and other circumstances, the borrower had a reasonable expectation that Ms. Bowker was representing the borrower in the matter. Ms. Bowker prepared a promissory note secured by a trust deed granting the lender an interest in the borrowerâ€™s home. The borrower subsequently executed a different promissory note prepared by another lawyer.In July 2005, Ms. Bowker met with both the borrower and lender regarding problems that had arisen in connection with the loan. Ms. Bowker undertook to represent the lender in collecting the loaned funds from the borrower without obtaining the informed consent of the former client.  In connection with her collection efforts, Ms. Bowker, at the lenderâ€™s instruction and despite objection by the borrower, sent the borrowerâ€™s brother a copy of the draft promissory note and trust deed she had prepared in 2004.Ms. Bowkerâ€™s conduct violated Oregon DR 5-105(E), prohibiting a lawyer from representing multiple current clients in any matters when such representation would result in an actual or likely conflict; Oregon RPC 1.9(a), prohibiting a lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter from thereafter representing another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that personâ€™s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing; and Oregon RPC 1.9(c)(2), prohibiting a lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter or whose present or former firm has formerly represented a client in a matter from thereafter revealing information relating to the representation except as the Rules would permit or require with respect to a client.Felice P.

Lehinger (WSBA No. 15544, admitted 1985), of Spokane, was suspended for one year, effective upon his return to active status, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2003 and 2005 involving practicing law while suspended, failure to inform clients of his suspension, and making false statements in connection with a disciplinary investigation.In August 2003, Mr. Lehinger received notice from the Washington State Bar Association that he had been suspended from the practice of law for failure to pay licensing fees. In September 2003, believing the statute of limitations applicable to the claim would soon expire, Mr. Lehinger filed a summons and complaint for damages in Spokane County District Court, signing the complaint as â€œAttorney for the Plaintiffs.â€ Mr. Lehinger did not inform his putative clients of his suspension.In October 2003, the Bar Association informed Mr. Lehinger that a grievance had been opened and requested his written response to the allegation that he practiced law while suspended. Mr. Lehingerâ€™s response included the following statements: â€œI filed the summons and complaint, even though I had not yet heard back from the Bar Association concerning my reinstatement. Subsequently, I learned that the check I sent in payment of the dues and penalty did not clear . . . .â€ These statements were false. The Bar Association had informed Mr. Lehinger the day before he filed the summons and complaint that his license would not be reinstated because his check had been returned for â€œNSF.â€ That day, a WSBA employee had informed Mr. Lehinger by telephone that he was required to make payment by cashierâ€™s check or money order and could not do so by credit card. After paying his license fees in December 2003, Mr. Lehinger was reinstated to active status. Mr. Lehinger has subsequently changed his status with the WSBA to inactive.

The discipline is based upon his entering a business transaction and conflict of interest with a client, and failure to adequately communicate with another client.Matter 1: Mr. Brunton and his wife assisted Mrs. H, a personal friend, for several years. Mr. Brunton also assisted Mrs. H with legal matters. In the 1980s, Mr. Brunton drafted Mrs. Hâ€™s will. In 1984, she requested that Mr. Brunton act as executor of her estate, and that he draft a Durable Power of Attorney naming himself as her attorney-in-fact if she became disabled. Mr. Brunton drafted these documents and Mrs. H executed them.In 1989, Mr. Brunton referred Mrs. H to another lawyer to change her will. Although Mr. Brunton shared office space with the other lawyer, they were not associated. The other lawyer discussed with Mr. Brunton potential conflicts that could exist because Mr. Brunton drafted Mrs. Hâ€™s earlier will and was named as executor. Additionally, the client now named Mr. Brunton as a residual beneficiary to one-third of her estate.In June 1991, Mrs. H asked Mr. Brunton to draft a new will for her. She requested that Mr. Brunton remain a residual beneficiary, but he refused. At Mrs. Hâ€™s request, Mr. Brunton removed himself as a beneficiary, but included his wife as a residuary beneficiary of the same one-third of Mrs. Hâ€™s estate. In July 1991, a bank trust officer wrote to Mr. Brunton about the conflicts related to his participation in drafting a will that provided for a gift to his wife.In 1991, Mr. Brunton again drafted a will for Mrs. H. He referred her to another lawyer to review the will because he was concerned about the conflict created by his wife being a beneficiary. The other lawyer read the will to Ms. H and she agreed that the will reflected her desire to give Mr. Bruntonâ€™s wife a substantial gift. In June 1993, after meeting with bank employees, Mrs. H requested that Mr. Brunton reduce the size of the general bequests in her will. Mr. Brunton assumed that these changes were made to reflect the size of the anticipated estate, but he did not know the exact size of her estate. Mrs. H died on January 4, 1997. Mr. Brunton administered her estate as the executor and as the attorney for the executor. He charged the $2,728.22 administrative expenses against the general bequests and the residuary pro rata. This provided a benefit of $909.40 to Mrs. Brunton.In 1990, Mrs. H told Mr. Brunton that she would like to sell her home to him. Mr. Brunton paid for two appraisals. The first stated the property was worth $93,000; the second, $110,000. Mr. Brunton showed both appraisals to Mrs. H. Mr. Brunton then purchased the house for less than the appraised value. The purchase and sale documents indicated that Mr. Brunton was a beneficiary under Mrs. Hâ€™s will, and that the additional $40,000 that could have been added to the purchase price was agreed to be a reduction in his portion of her estate. Mr. Brunton also paid the closing costs in the sale, even though they are usually paid by the seller. Mr. Brunton fully paid the purchase price in March 1994, including a 10 percent interest rate. There is no indication that Mr. Brunton pressured Mrs. H to sell her house to him. He did not, however, advise her to seek independent advice about the documents he drafted or the conflicts of interest created by selling her house to him.Matter 2: From 1981 through May 1997, Mr. Brunton leased office space to Mr. R. Mr. Brunton and Mr. and Mrs. R were long-time friends. In the 1980s, Mr. Brunton drafted a will and durable power of attorney for Mr. and Mrs. R. In late 1997 or early 1998, both Mr. and Mrs. R experienced health problems and asked Mr. Brunton to become more involved in their affairs. Mr. R asked Mr. Brunton to add his signature to the Rsâ€™ bank account so that Mr. Brunton could pay the Rsâ€™ bills. The form prepared by the bank teller made Mr. Brunton a co-signer and indicated the account was joint with right of survivorship. Neither Mr. Brunton nor the Rs realized that Mr. Brunton received an ownership interest in the account.In April 1988, Mr. Brunton started to pay the Rsâ€™ bills and pick up their bank statements. Mr. Brunton provided services to Mr. R regarding medical insurance, home refinancing, medical bills and home caregivers, and met with Mr. Râ€™s accountant. Mr. Brunton did not explain his billing rate or procedure to Mr. R. He also did not keep track of all of his time. Between March 30 and July 10, 1998, Mr. Brunton billed Mr. R $4,330.50. None of the bills reflect a breakdown for the amount of time spent or for an hourly rate charged. On June 5, 1998, Mr. Brunton issued two checks to himself from Mr. and Mrs. Râ€™s account totaling $1,972, significantly depleting the available funds in the account.Mrs. R died on June 11, 1998. Mr. Brunton paid himself for his remaining bills after Mrs. Râ€™s death. This left $174.59 in the Rsâ€™ account. Mr. Râ€™s caregiver told Mr. R about the checks Mr. Brunton had written to himself. Mr. R told the caregiver that Mr. Brunton did not have authority to pay himself from the checking account. On July 20, 1998, Mr. Brunton returned all of the money he had disbursed to himself to the Rsâ€™ checking account.Mr. Bruntonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.8(a), prohibiting entering a business transaction with a client, unless the transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client, and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client in a manner which can be reasonably understood by the client, the client is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel, and the client consents; RPC 1.8(c), prohibiting lawyers from preparing an instrument giving the lawyer or a person related to the lawyer, as a parent, child, sibling or spouse, any substantial gift from a client, including a testamentary gift, except where the client is related to the donee; RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting lawyers from representing a client if the representation will be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after a full disclosure; RPC 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent a client; RPC 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters; and 1.5(b), requiring lawyers to explain fee agreements to new clients.Jonathan Burke represented the Bar Association.

This discipline was based on Mr. Peterson's conduct involving communication with a person represented by counsel. Mr. Peterson is to be distinguished from Todd L. Peterson of San Francisco.In August 2004, a client terminated Mr. Peterson's employment as his lawyer in a personal-injury matter and hired new counsel. In September 2004, a dispute arose between Mr. Peterson and the former client over the amount of Mr. Peterson's fee and his entitlement to a lien against any proceeds from the settlement of the personal-injury matter. The new lawyer undertook to represent Mr. Peterson's former client in the fee dispute. Although he knew that his former client was represented by counsel in this dispute, Mr. Peterson communicated directly with the former client by letter on the subject of the personal-injury matter, the amount of the fee, and his entitlement to recover his fee from the proceeds of the personal-injury matter.Mr. Peterson's conduct violated Oregon RPC 4.2, which prohibits a lawyer, when representing a client or the lawyer's own interests, from communicating or causing another to communicate on the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by a lawyer on that subject unless (a) the lawyer has prior consent of the lawyer representing such other person, (b) the lawyer is authorized by law or by court order to do so, or (c) a written agreement requires a written notice or demand to be sent to such other person, in which case a copy of such notice or demand shall also be sent to such other person's lawyer.Felice P.

The resignation was based on his conduct between 2004 and 2005 involving sexual relations with a then-current client, conflicts of interest, and other conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.In August 2003, Mr. Junke began representing a client in a dependency action involving the client's son. The dependency action was initiated after the client was arrested for possession of controlled substances with intent to sell and child endangerment. As a result of the dependency action, the client's son was placed with relatives and the client was allowed only supervised visitation, with supervision to be provided by either the ""relative care giver"" or a person approved by the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS). In November 2003, the client hired Mr. Junke to represent her in her criminal matter. In August 2004, the client pleaded guilty and was sentenced. During the course of the representation, Mr. Junke and his client began a personal and intimate relationship, which included sexual relations. The relationship continued until approximately mid-2005. After the client was sentenced in 2004, Mr. Junke took her with him to Seattle on two occasions. On one of these trips, the client's son accompanied them. Although the client was not permitted to leave Walla Walla County without permission from her probation officer, Mr. Junke obtained permission from the probation officer for only one such trip. In addition, although the client was allowed only supervised visitation with her son, Mr. Junke never sought approval from DSHS to supervise the client's visits with her son during these trips.Mr. Junke's conduct violated RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer's own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes that the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after a full disclosure of material facts; RPC 1.8(k), prohibiting a lawyer from having sexual relations with a current client of the lawyer unless a consensual sexual relationship existed between them at the time the lawyer/client relationship commenced; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Joanne S.

Hunter (WSBA No. 29488, admitted 1999), of Olympia, was disbarred, effective July 21, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2004 and 2005 involving sending sexually explicit material to a minor client, asking the minor client to engage in sexual relations with him, the crime of attempted possession of depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, and the crime of tampering with a witness.In October 2004, Mr. Hunter began representing a 17-year-old client in a criminal matter. During the course of the representation, the minor client e-mailed Mr. Hunter about the status of her case.  Mr. Hunter responded via e-mail, and, over time, Mr. Hunterâ€™s e-mails to the client became sexually explicit. Among other things, Mr. Hunter asked the client to have sex with him, described different sexual acts he wanted to engage in with the client, and asked if he could take pictures and videos of the client performing sexual acts with him. Mr. Hunter also e-mailed the client sexually explicit pictures, including nude photographs of himself.In December 2004, a police detective interviewed Mr. Hunter about the sexually explicit e-mails and photographs sent to the client. Mr. Hunter denied sending them, claiming that they had been sent by his ex-girlfriend without his knowledge or permission. Sometime later, Mr. Hunter contacted his ex-girlfriend and asked her to falsely testify that she was the one who had sent the sexually explicit e-mails and pictures. In exchange for doing so, Mr. Hunter promised to provide certain monetary benefits. In November 2005, Mr. Hunter was charged with attempted possession of depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct (RCW 9A.28.020 and 9.68A.070), a gross misdemeanor, and tampering with a witness (RCW 9A.72.120(1) and 10.99.020), a felony.

Tezak (WSBA No. 23541, admitted 1994) of Mukilteo, was disbarred, effective July 25, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court, following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2000 leading to his conviction of the crimes of wire fraud and money laundering.Mr. Tezak was a principal of a purportedly tax-exempt charitable organization. He was also a director and officer of a limited liability company, which was purportedly a lender for a private development project. In May 2000, Mr. Tezak represented to various individuals that he had access to approximately $20 million in funds from a particular individual. Mr. Tezak participated in an interstate telephone call with a representative of an investment bank, during which he facilitated the issuance of a letter by that representative affirming the existence of more than $20 million in assets on deposit. In two letters dated May 11, 2000, Mr. Tezak affirmed the availability of those funds, plus $43 million in additional private financing, for investment in the development project. Mr. Tezak knew that his representations in the letters were false and fraudulent. Mr. Tezak had reason to know that one of the letters was faxed in interstate commerce. Prior to his making false representations concerning the availability of funding for the development project, Mr. Tezak had entered into an agreement to be paid $250,000 by the developer for up to five verifications of financing that he would provide. Pursuant to that agreement, and based on the verification of funds that Mr. Tezak performed, the private developer paid Mr. Tezak $50,000 for his services in the form of a cashierâ€™s check payable to Mr. Tezakâ€™s charitable organization. Thereafter, Mr. Tezak deposited the cashierâ€™s check into his brotherâ€™s bank account in Montana and later directed the funds to be transferred to the bank account of the charitable organization, which was also located in Montana. From that account, Mr. Tezak withdrew and used the funds for a variety of personal purposes knowing that the funds were derived from an underlying wire-fraud scheme and that the transaction was designed for the purpose of concealing the nature, location, source, and/or ownership of the funds.In May 2005, Mr. Tezak pled guilty as charged in federal court to the crimes of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1343 and 2, and money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C.

This discipline is based on his conduct in 1997 involving conflicts of interest.Mr. Patrick was close friends with an individual who had formed a trust that produced income by making loans. In two instances, Mr. Patrick referred potential borrowers to the trust and actively facilitated loan transactions from the trust by performing a number of legal services on behalf of each of the participants in the transaction. In one matter, Mr. Patrick negotiated and secured the loan on a friendâ€™s behalf and signed the promissory note as a guarantor. Mr. Patrick did not recognize that his judgment as a lawyer could have been affected by his own interests as guarantor of the loan and failed to make appropriate disclosures and obtain the borrowerâ€™s consent to the continued representation. Mr. Patrick also acquired a special power of attorney from the lender to allow him to conduct business on the lenderâ€™s behalf and to close the transaction in the lenderâ€™s absence. In a second matter, Mr. Patrick represented a client in negotiating, securing, and facilitating a loan from the trust. Mr. Patrick also reviewed draft documents in connection with the transaction sent to him by the lender and was aware that the lender was looking to him to ensure that the trustâ€™s interests were protected.Mr. Patrickâ€™s conduct violated Oregon DR 5-101(A), prohibiting a lawyer, except with the consent of the client after full disclosure, from accepting or continuing employment if the exercise of the lawyerâ€™s professional judgment on behalf of the lawyerâ€™s client will be or reasonably may be affected by the lawyerâ€™s own financial business, property, or personal interests; and DR 5-105(E), permitting a lawyer to represent multiple current clients in instances otherwise prohibited when such representation would not result in an actual conflict and when each client consents to the multiple representation after full disclosure.Felice P.

This discipline was based on his conduct between 1997 and 2004 involving improper withdrawal, neglect of a legal matter, failure to account for client funds, and failure to properly deliver client property.Mr. Jackson was hired by a client to represent her in a personal-injury matter. In March 1997, Mr. Jackson filed a complaint on behalf of the client. The court entered an order transferring the action to arbitration. Mr. Jackson requested that the client deliver $1,100 for costs incurred and to be incurred in the action, which he received in October 1997 and deposited into his lawyer trust account. In October 1997, Mr. Jackson withdrew $630.22 for expenses and costs incurred. In November 1997, the court issued a notice of pending dismissal of the action. The court dismissed the case in December 1997 and sent a copy of the judgment of dismissal to Mr. Jackson.

Huddleston (WSBA No. 18942, admitted 1989), of Seattle and Everett, has been disbarred, following a hearing, by order of the Supreme Court, effective April 8, 1999. The discipline is based upon his using misleading and false statements to obtain magazine publisher customer lists, and using these lists to solicit unauthorized subscription renewal fees using false statements.In 1990 and 1991, Mr. Huddleston started Northwest Subscription Service and Pinnacle Subscription Service, businesses purporting to be magazine tele-marketing services. Knowing that magazine publishers rented their subscriber lists for pre-approved mail marketing, Mr. Huddleston created a ""product."" He used a non-existent company name and created a flyer advertising an oak towel rack. Mr. Huddleston did not intend to mail the flyers or manufacture the products. He testified that he intended to ""trick"" the publishers into providing him their customer lists. Mr. Huddleston obtained approximately 300,000 customer names. Each customer list stated that it was to be used for a one-time mailing only.Using the publishersâ€™ customer lists, Mr. Huddleston and his agents (Huddle-ston) contacted the customers and solicited subscription renewals. Huddleston convinced the customers that the agents were authorized to solicit renewals, and falsely told the customers that if they did not renew immediately, the subscription prices would increase. Huddleston collected the renewal funds directly, retaining 75 to 85 percent of the funds, and forwarding the remainder to publishing clearinghouses. Mr. Huddleston admitted that he deprived the magazine publishers of hundreds of thousands of dollars.The publishers received many complaints about Huddleston and contacted him, requesting that he stop his unauthorized solicitation of their customers. Mr. Huddleston used many deceptive means to continue his business, including giving false and misleading information about how he obtained the customer lists and changing the companiesâ€™ names. During a lawsuit brought by a publisher, Mr. Huddleston twice filed bankruptcy petitions the week prior to the scheduled trial date. On the day the Court entered a non-dischargeable $825,000 judgment against Mr. Huddleston, he filed articles to incorporate his law practice and transferred assets to the corporation. Mr. Huddleston entered a payment plan with the publisher and made all required payments.Mr. Huddlestonâ€™s conduct violated Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) 8.4(a), violating RPCs, or doing so through the acts of others; 8.4(b), committing criminal acts that reflect adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer; and 8.4(c), engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. His conduct also violated RCW 9A.56.020-040, theft by deception and 18 U.S.C. 1341 and 1343, mail fraud. Mr. Huddle-stonâ€™s conduct also violated his Oath of Attorney.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 2001 and 2002 involving contacting parties known to be represented by counsel.Mr. Casey represented an injured client in a workersâ€™ compensation claim. In November 2001, Mr. Casey received a letter from a lawyer advising Mr. Casey that he represented the clientâ€™s employer and its workersâ€™ compensation claims administrator (Company A), and directing Mr. Casey to send all correspondence regarding the matter to him. Upon receipt of the letter, Mr. Casey sent the lawyer a letter acknowledging the lawyerâ€™s appearance. Although he disagreed with the assertion that he was precluded from contacting Company A, stating that it was common practice for the employeeâ€™s lawyer to communicate with the workersâ€™ compensation plan administrator, Mr. Casey agreed to limit his communications regarding the matter to Company Aâ€™s lawyer. In December 2001 and February 2002, having become frustrated with the manner in which the claim was being administered by Company A and its lawyer, Mr. Casey sent letters to a claims representative at Company A complaining about how the matter was being handled. Mr. Casey received a letter from Company Aâ€™s lawyer demanding that he cease communicating directly with his client. By letter, Mr. Casey agreed not to contact Company A directly and again advised the lawyer that he disagreed that RPC 4.2 prohibited him from contacting Company A. In August 2002, still frustrated with administration of the claim, Mr. Casey again wrote directly to Company A and sent a copy of the letter directly to the represented employer.Mr. Caseyâ€™s conduct violated RPC 4.2, prohibiting a lawyer, in representing a client, from communicating about the subject of the representation with a party that the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized by law to do so.Leslie C.

Curtis Hilton (WSBA No. 4028, admitted 1958), of Lakewood, was disbarred, effective September 18, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on conduct between 1996 and 2004 involving failure to communicate with a client, lack of diligence, attempting to settle a matter without client authority, failure to expedite litigation, failure to put a contingent fee agreement in writing, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.In May 1996, Mr. Hilton was hired to represent a client in a hearing involving the forfeiture of certain personal items seized by the county sheriffâ€™s office. The client believed Mr. Hilton was representing her pro bono. Mr. Hilton believed that he and the client had entered into a contingent fee agreement under which he was to be paid one-third of any recovery, but Mr. Hilton had neither prepared a written contingent fee agreement nor had his client sign one. After a hearing examiner upheld the forfeiture of the clientâ€™s property, Mr. Hilton filed a petition for judicial review. Mr. Hilton took no further action on the case and did not communicate with his client for the next 16 months. In March 1998, the court issued a notice of dismissal for want of prosecution. Mr. Hilton filed a response, signed under penalty of perjury, stating, â€œPetitioner will immediately proceed to prosecute this claim by her undersigned counsel.â€ Mr. Hilton took no action in the case for another 16 months. In July 1999, the court clerk again sought to dismiss the case for want of prosecution. Mr. Hilton filed another response again stating, â€œPetitioner will immediately proceed to prosecute this claim by her undersigned counsel.â€ Mr. Hilton filed a motion to set the briefing schedule, but did not file the brief as required. In November 1999, the defendant in the case filed a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution. The court denied the motion. For the next 19 months, Mr. Hilton took no action. In June 2001, the court clerk issued another notice of dismissal for want of prosecution. Mr. Hilton again filed a declaration stating, â€œPetitioner will immediately proceed to prosecute this claim by her undersigned counsel.â€In June 2001 and February 2003, the client sent Mr. Hilton letters in which she informed him of her current address and requested information about her case. Mr. Hilton did not respond. In August 2003, in response to another dismissal for want of prosecution from the court clerk, Mr. Hilton filed a motion requesting a briefing schedule. At that point, the deputy prosecuting attorney sent Mr. Hilton a letter indicating his willingness to discuss a settlement. The letter offered an equal distribution of the proceeds of the seized property, but stated that the offer would only be held open for a brief period. Mr. Hilton did not communicate the settlement offer to his client. In October 2003, the court clerk issued another dismissal notice. In December 2003, Mr. Hilton and the deputy prosecutor reached agreement on the terms of a settlement. Mr. Hilton did not tell his client of the settlement offer or that he was accepting it. Over the next two weeks, the deputy prosecutor twice sent Mr. Hilton a proposed agreed order of dismissal and a settlement agreement to be signed by both Mr. Hilton and his client. Mr. Hilton did not present the documents to his client or return them to the deputy prosecutor. Mr. Hilton informed the court that the case had been settled. On January 26, 2004, the court informed the parties that the case would be dismissed if settlement papers were not filed by February 13. The deputy prosecutor sent Mr. Hilton two letters advising him that the settlement offer would be withdrawn and that he would request the court to dismiss the case if the papers were not signed and returned to him. Mr. Hilton did not respond to either letter and did not inform his client about the situation. In April 2004, the court dismissed the case on its own motion. Mr. Hilton did not tell his client that her case had been dismissed. She learned about the dismissal after reviewing the docket for her case online. In response to an e-mail from the client, Mr. Hilton advised her that the case had been settled and that he held a bank draft in his file for $1,500. Mr. Hilton met with the client shortly thereafter, at which time Mr. Hilton admitted that he only had a draft of the settlement agreement and agreed order of dismissal in his file, not a bank draft for $1,500. Mr. Hilton then had his client sign the settlement agreement, without telling her that the settlement offer had been withdrawn. He transmitted the signed agreement to the deputy prosecutor with a request to remit settlement funds. The deputy prosecutor replied that the offer had been withdrawn in March 2004 and that he would no longer honor the settlement proposal.Mr. Hiltonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued, and to abide by a clientâ€™s decision whether to accept an offer of settlement of a matter; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(c)(1), requiring that a contingent fee be in writing; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; RPC 8.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.

815.html,34296,Karim Hamir,,Suspension,9/18/2006,,"Karim Hamir (WSBA No. 34296, admitted 2003), of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, was suspended from the practice of law for six months, effective September 18, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation. This discipline was based on conduct in 2004 involving misrepresentations to potential employers and false and misleading statements in advertising materials.In 2004, Mr. Hamir was seeking employment as a lawyer in the Seattle area. In e-mails sent to two unaffiliated solo practitioners, Mr. Hamir provided information regarding his background and credentials. This information included copies of his rÃ©sumÃ©, in which he represented that he had graduated from â€œMichigan Law,â€ implying that he had attended the University of Michigan Law School. Mr. Hamirâ€™s rÃ©sumÃ© also represented that he had graduated â€œwith honors,â€ was in the â€œtop five percentâ€ of his law school class, and had been â€œLaw Review Chief Editor.â€ In fact, Mr. Hamir had attended Thomas M. Cooley Law School in Lansing, Michigan, held a class rank of 142 out of 189, graduated from law school with no academic honors, and was not selected for the Law Review. Mr. Hamir also represented that he had obtained a â€œB.A. Honours Business Administrationâ€ degree from York University and that he had graduated from York with a grade point average of 3.96 out of 4.00. In fact, he had obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology at York University and had been an average student.In an e-mail message to one potential employer in June 2004, and in marketing materials he later disseminated to the public, Mr. Hamir represented that he was licensed to practice law in Canada â€œthrough the Upper Law Society of Canada.â€ In fact, Mr. Hamir was not licensed to practice law in Canada through any attorney-licensing entity.In 2005, Mr. Hamir entered into a partnership with another Washington lawyer for the purposes of practicing law. In advertising materials and on the firmâ€™s public website, Mr. Hamir represented that he had received a â€œBachelorâ€™s of Business Administration from New York University, summa cum laudeâ€ and had also obtained a Masterâ€™s degree. In truth, Mr. Hamir had never attended New York University, had not obtained a degree in business administration, never graduated with the academic distinction of summa cum laude, and never obtained a Masterâ€™s degree from any educational institution. Mr. Hamirâ€™s conduct violated RPC 7.1(a), prohibiting a lawyer from making a false or misleading communication about the lawyer or the lawyerâ€™s services; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Kevin M.

816.html,23058,Robert Brandt,,Disbarment,9/19/2006,,"Robert E. Brandt (WSBA No. 23058, admitted 1993), of Bothell, was disbarred, effective September 19, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. In entering into the stipulation, Mr. Brandt agreed that if the matter were to proceed to a public hearing, there was a substantial likelihood that the Bar Association would be able to prove, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, the facts and misconduct described therein (and summarized herein). The discipline was based on his conduct in 2004 involving conflicts of interest, trust account irregularities, failure to comply with discovery requests, false statements, failure to adequately supervise a nonlawyer employee, commission of a criminal act, dishonesty, and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.  Mr. Brandt operated a high-volume real estate escrow business, known as Escrow Authority, which was the assumed business name of Mr. Brandtâ€™s law firm/professional corporation. Escrow Authority was Mr. Brandtâ€™s primary business; he handled only a few legal matters for family and friends. Mr. Brandt used his law firmâ€™s trust account to receive and disburse funds associated with the real estate closings handled by Escrow Authority, which operated two limited liability corporations out of the Escrow Authority office, as well as several branch offices.In June 2005, the Kirkland Police Department executed a search warrant on Escrow Authorityâ€™s Kirkland office and seized some of its business records. Subsequently, it was discovered that there was a shortage of about $3 million in Mr. Brandtâ€™s trust account. This shortage was allegedly due to the theft by one or more of Mr. Brandtâ€™s employees. Mr. Brandt could not account for the shortfall, which resulted in the filing of a number of grievances against him. The following conduct, which did not arise from the theft of trust account funds, established grounds for discipline:â€¢ Failing to maintain complete records of client funds in the trust account and failing to provide an accounting of trust account funds; â€¢ Failing to reimburse funds to a client when requested;â€¢ Failing to maintain client funds in a trust account, to properly review trust account records, and to supervise his staff in handling these records;â€¢ Falsely stating under oath that he did not have malpractice insurance;â€¢ Permitting an employee to handle a real estate closing when the employee was the purchaser and reseller of the real property;â€¢ Failing to disclose to parties in three different matters that the limited liability corporation and Escrow Authority, to which they were paying various fees, were his businesses and that the fees were being paid to him;â€¢ Failing to ensure that the conduct of employees handling client escrow funds was compatible with Mr. Brandtâ€™s professional obligations as a lawyer, such as ensuring that documents were being notarized by persons having personal contact with the parties, that closing disbursements were not being made until after the recording of the deeds, and that tax payments and any promised reimbursement for tax penalties were promptly made;â€¢ Failing to promptly disburse funds from the trust account in accordance with escrow instructions.Mr. Brandtâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.5(b), requiring that when a lawyer has not regularly represented the client, or if the fee agreement is substantially different than that previously used by the parties, the basis or rate of the fee or factors involved in determining the charges for legal services and the lawyerâ€™s billing practices shall be communicated to the client, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation;  RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be affected and the client consents in writing after consultation and a full disclosure in writing of the material facts; RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm, including advances for costs and expenses, be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and that no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein; RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by a client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive; RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests upon termination of representation; RPC 3.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer, in pretrial procedure, from failing to make reasonably diligent efforts to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing party; RPC 4.1(a), prohibiting a lawyer, in the course of representing a client, from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; RPC 5.3(a), requiring that a partner in a law firm make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that a nonlawyer assistant's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; RPC 5.3(b), requiring a lawyer with direct supervisory authority over a nonlawyer assistant to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the person's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Debra J.

817.html,22519,Dennis Olsen,,Disbarment,9/19/2006,,"Dennis F. Olsen (WSBA No. 22519, admitted 1993), formerly of Everett, was disbarred, effective September 19, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2000 and 2004 involving violation of state and federal tax laws, dishonesty, lack of competence, lack of diligence, failure to communicate with a client, failure to expedite litigation, and failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation.Matter 1: Commencing in 1999, Mr. Olsen was a principal in a succession of law firms that operated a multi-state, low-cost bankruptcy practice. The firm hired local lawyers to practice within the jurisdictions of their respective bar admissions. In 2001, after suffering financial losses in the bankruptcy venture, Mr. Olsen terminated the employment of a firm lawyer working in Portland, Oregon. The lawyer agreed to handle the firmâ€™s Oregon cases if he had either met or provided representation to the client. When the lawyer refused to take over the representation of a client with whom he had had no contact, an argument ensued. During the argument, Mr. Olsen threatened that he would not pay taxes withheld from the lawyerâ€™s paychecks. As a result, the lawyer filed a grievance with the Bar Association. The lawyer did not receive a 2001 W-2 within the statutory time limit. After requesting that the firm provide him a W-2 for his 2001 earnings, the lawyer belatedly received a W-2 on which the employer was identified as a defunct predecessor firm and that reflected an invalid employer tax ID number and an incorrect employer address. A second W-2 was later issued for 2001, reflecting all of the tax withholding deductions from the lawyerâ€™s 2001 pay and the correct employer information. During the ensuing disciplinary hearing, Mr. Olsen admitted that he had not paid state or federal tax authorities the taxes withheld from the lawyerâ€™s salary in 2000 or 2001, and that he had not refunded the withheld money to the lawyer. The funds withheld totaled at least $11,398.70. Mr. Olsen also admitted to having filed amended returns that claimed under penalty of perjury that he had paid the lawyer the full amount of his gross wages when, in fact, withholding had occurred. These additional amended returns were filed by Mr. Olsen and submitted to the Bar Association in an attempt to mislead the Bar Association in its investigation.Matter 2: On April 7, 2000, Mr. Olsen met with and agreed to represent a client in an immigration matter for a $1,500 fee. In March 2000, the Board of Immigration Appeals had affirmed an immigration judgeâ€™s denial of the clientâ€™s asylum application and issued a deportation order. The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, which had been assisting the client through a volunteer lawyer, explained the clientâ€™s options in a letter dated March 30, 2000. The letter advised the client that although a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had been filed, the volunteer lawyer would no longer be available to assist the client. Other options mentioned in the letter included filing a motion to reopen a previous I-485 petition (application to register permanent residence or adjust status), or a motion to reopen the asylum application.The agreed purpose for the representation was for Mr. Olsen to seek an adjustment of the clientâ€™s immigration status and to assist him in obtaining a green card. Mr. Olsen did not prepare a fee agreement or any description of his duties. At the initial meeting, the client paid Mr. Olsen $750 and gave him a copy of his file, which included copies of previously filed pro se petitions and applications, as well the March 30 letter from the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.After undertaking the representation, Mr. Olsen did not take any steps to obtain the clientâ€™s INS file, to review the BIA legal files or any other public files, or to discern the action that needed to be undertaken prior to the expiration of the time to bring a motion to reopen. No motion to reopen was ever filed by Mr. Olsen, despite having had almost two months between the date hired and the deadline for filing the motion. In January 2000, the client paid Mr. Olsen $800. Mr. Olsen completed and filed a second I-485 application and had the client pay a second I-485 penalty fee of $1,000. This second application was a useless act, since the application would not be adjudicated unless and until the clientâ€™s immigration application had been reopened by motion, and Mr. Olsen had already allowed the time to bring such a motion to pass. Additionally, the application contained several significant errors, including the incorrect assertions that the client was not married and that the client was not involved in a deportation proceeding. After filing the second I-485 application, Mr. Olsen failed to do any legal work on behalf of the client during the next eight months he represented him, and he had little or no contact with the client. The client was subsequently referred to another immigration lawyer, who accepted the case on a pro bono basis and promptly moved to reopen the asylum issue based on the fact that the client had not received effective assistance of counsel from Mr. Olsen. After reviewing the facts surrounding Mr. Olsenâ€™s representation, INS agreed to a joint motion to reopen the earlier denial of the first I-485 application.Matter 3: During the disciplinary investigations and proceeding arising from the above-described matters, Mr. Olsen engaged in a pattern of knowingly and willfully failing to comply with Bar Association requests for information and documents and the hearing officerâ€™s orders regarding compliance.Mr. Olsenâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interest of the client; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, violation of federal and Oregon state tax laws, and theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any unjustified act of assault or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here, ELC 1.5; 5.3(e)(4); 5.5(c); 10.11(g); and 10.13(e)).Marsha A.

This discipline was based on his conduct involving violations of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act.In September 2005, Mr. Jurdy pleaded guilty in Spokane County Superior Court to three counts of possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) in violation of RCW 69.50.4013(1).Mr. Jurdyâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any unjustified act of assault or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law, whether the same be committed in the course of his or her conduct as a lawyer, or otherwise, and whether the same constitutes a felony or misdemeanor or not.Nancy Bickford Miller represented the Bar Association.

819.html,9634,George Ryan,,Reprimand,3/13/2006,,"G. Thomas Ryan (WSBA No. 9634, admitted 1979), of Puyallup, was ordered to receive a reprimand on March 13, 2006, following a stipulation approved by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2005 involving lack of diligence and failure to communicate with a client.In January 2005, Mr. Ryan was hired by clients who wanted to petition for custody of their grandchild. According to the clients, they asked Mr. Ryan to file the petition by January 24, 2005, and he agreed to do so. The clients paid Mr. Ryan $2,700 for advance fees and costs. Between January 24 and January 27, the clients called Mr. Ryanâ€™s office many times. He did not take or return any of their telephone calls. In early February, the biological father, who had custody of the child, took the child out of state to visit his parents. On February 9, Mr. Ryan filed the clientsâ€™ nonparental custody petition, noted a hearing on the petition for February 28, 2005, and obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order (TRO) immediately restraining the parents from having contact with the child and placing him in the clientsâ€™ custody. Mr. Ryan had the childâ€™s mother served with the petition, but the process server could not personally serve the childâ€™s father because he was out of state visiting his parents. Mr. Ryan had not obtained an order authorizing peace officers to remove the child from either of the parentsâ€™ custody (a pick-up order). Without a pick-up order, the TRO was unenforceable. The clients asked Mr. Ryan to obtain a pick-up order. Mr. Ryan declined to do so. He met with the clients and informed them that Child Protective Services (CPS) had filed a recommendation that the mother be awarded custody of the child. Mr. Ryan recommended that the clients strike the hearing date based on the CPS letter. The clients disagreed with his recommendation.A lawyer for the mother entered a notice of appearance in the proceeding and filed responsive pleadings, which were voluminous and contained several declarations refuting the allegations set for the in the clientsâ€™ nonparental custody petition. The mother asked the court to dismiss the petition and requested an award of attorneyâ€™s fees for having to respond to a frivolous petition. Mr. Ryan did not extensively review the responsive pleadings before the hearing. At the hearing, the commissioner determined that the nonparental custody petition could not be considered because Mr. Ryan had not provided the court with the clientsâ€™ DCFS/CPS background checks or criminal background checks as required by statute. The commissioner entered an order placing the child with his mother, directing Mr. Ryan to file the background checks, and ordering a new hearing to take place within 60 days. The motherâ€™s motion to dismiss and request for attorneyâ€™s fees was also to be heard at that time.After the hearing, the clients waited outside the courtroom to speak with Mr. Ryan, but they could not locate him. After waiting a week for Mr. Ryan to contact them and discuss the next steps, the clients made several attempts to contact Mr. Ryan. He did not return any of their telephone messages. During one attempt, Mr. Ryan answered the telephone, and the client expressed dissatisfaction with the representation and told Mr. Ryan to do the job correctly or refund the fee. Mr. Ryan told the client he would discuss the case with her after she calmed down. During the following week, he did not return any of their calls.In March 2005, the clients filed a grievance with the Bar Association. In Mr. Ryanâ€™s written response to the grievance, he stated that he intended to withdraw from the case. Mr. Ryan did not tell the clients he intended to withdraw and did not file a notice of withdrawal. He did not obtain the DCFS/CPS background checks or the criminal background checks as required by the commissionerâ€™s February 28 order.On June 2, the childâ€™s mother filed a motion to dismiss the case and for attorneyâ€™s fees, noting the motion for a hearing on June 10, 2005. Mr. Ryan did not immediately notify his clients about the pending hearing. On the afternoon of June 8, he mailed them a copy of the motion to dismiss and supporting documentation. Included in the mailing were Mr. Ryanâ€™s notice of intent to withdraw and his response to the motion to dismiss. The response consisted of a motion for a three-week continuance on grounds that Mr. Ryan was withdrawing as counsel of record. Under the terms of notice, Mr. Ryanâ€™s withdrawal was effective on July 22, 2005, although he did not intend to do any further legal work for the clients. The clients received this information the evening before the hearing.Meanwhile, on June 7, 2005, disciplinary counsel informed the clients about the hearing on June 10. The clients called several lawyers listed in the Yellow Pages, asking if any of them would represent them at the hearing. A lawyer agreed to accompany the clients to the hearing, although she told them she could not file a notice of appearance, as Mr. Ryan was still the attorney of record. Mr. Ryan did not appear at the June 10 hearing, at which the commissioner entered an order continuing the motion to dismiss in order to give the new lawyer time to respond. The order indicated that the court would grant the motherâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees. In August 2005, the commissioner entered an order dismissing the nonparental custody petition and awarding the mother $3,510.50 for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs incurred in defending against the petition.Mr. Ryanâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.Leslie C.

82.html,18949,Lloyd Jones,,Disbarment,5/8/2002,,"Lloyd M. Jones (WSBA No. 18949, admitted 1989), of Seattle, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court approving a stipulation, effective May 8, 2002. The discipline is based upon his conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice between 1995 and 2001.Mr. Jones and Ms. M met in 1995. In March 1998, Ms. M sold two condominiums for $254,000, and shortly thereafter purchased a duplex for $253,000 jointly in Ms. Mâ€™s and Mr. Jonesâ€™ names. In March 2000, Ms. M quit-claimed the duplex to Mr. Jones.Between January 1995 and April 2001, checks payable to Mr. Jones totaling over $41,000 were written on Ms. Mâ€™s bank account. Mr. Jones completed credit-card applications for Ms. M, and requested additional cards in his name. The cards were used for personal expenses.In September 2000, Ms. Mâ€™s son filed a petition asking for a guardian for his motherâ€™s person and estate because she suffered from blindness, short-term memory loss, and had demonstrated inability to care for herself and her affairs. In December, Ms. M executed a will, leaving all her property to Mr. Jones. On December 28, the court appointed a guardian ad litem, who interviewed Ms. M on February 5, 2001.On February 12, Ms. M and Mr. Jones were married. Several months later, Ms. M did not understand that she was married to Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones stipulated that he married Ms. M to circumvent the guardianship process. The court subsequently invalidated this marriage. On February 20, 2001, the guardian ad litem recommended that a neutral third party be appointed guardian for Ms. Mâ€™s person and estate; Partners in Care was appointed on March 6, 2001.The order appointing a guardian also ordered Mr. Jones to disclose to the guardian, within 60 days, all transactions on behalf of or with Ms. M, and provide documentation. Mr. Jones did not disclose the transactions or provide documentation, and on May 24, 2001, the court entered an order assessing sanctions against Mr. Jones for failure to comply, and requiring him to provide the documents in three weeks. On June 19, Mr. Jones provided the guardian with some documents and signed releases for records from his bank accounts. On June 22, the court entered an order finding Mr. Jonesâ€™s compliance was de minimus, and that he was attempting to hinder the guardian. The guardian and Mr. Jones subsequently agreed to a settlement approved by the court, in which Mr. Jones quit-claimed his interest in the duplex to Ms. M, agreed to entry of a judgment of $99,300, and permitted the guardian to obtain the remaining funds in a bank account in Mr. Jonesâ€™s name. At the time her property was transferred to Mr. Jones, Ms. M was not competent to agree to the transfers or to understand it.Mr. Jonesâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 8.4(b), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in criminal acts that reflect adversely on lawyersâ€™ honesty or trustworthiness; 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in acts involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; and 8.4(d), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.Anne Seidel represented the Bar Association.

This resignation was based on his 2005 conviction of first-degree attempted murder.On November 8, 2005, Mr. Joice was charged in King County Superior Court with the crime of first-degree attempted murder for attempting, with premeditated intent, to cause the death of lawyer Kevin Jung. At the time of the incident, Mr. Jung represented parties in litigation with Mr. Joiceâ€™s clients. On December 20, 2005, a jury convicted Mr. Joice of the charged offense.Mr. Joiceâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any unjustified act of assault or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law, whether the same be committed in the course of his or her conduct as a lawyer, or otherwise, and whether the same constitutes a felony or misdemeanor or not.Randy V.

822.html,5794,William Reseburg,,Resignation in Lieu of Disbarment,4/3/2006,,"William R. Reseburg (WSBA No. 5794, admitted 1974), of Seattle, resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective April 3, 2006. This resignation was based on ongoing conduct involving trust-account irregularities.Commencing in the mid-1980s, Mr. Reseburgâ€™s solo practice involved representing insurance companies in collection suits against at-fault uninsured motorists. Mr. Reseburg would obtain default judgments against the at-fault motorists and enforce the judgments by having the Department of Licensing revoke the motoristsâ€™ driver licenses until the motorists satisfied the judgments against them. Motorists who satisfied the judgments against them, either by making a one-time payment or entering into installment agreements with Mr. Reseburgâ€™s office, could be eligible to get their drivers licenses reinstated. Mr. Reseburg generally had hundreds of cases open.In late 2002, while searching for a missing file, Mr. Reseburgâ€™s legal assistant discovered about 20 files in Mr. Reseburgâ€™s desk drawers. The legal assistant was unaware that Mr. Reseburg stored any files in his desk drawers. Review of one of the files revealed that there was no record of payment of settlement proceeds to the client. After additional investigation, the legal assistant became aware of a number of other files in which a satisfaction of judgment had been entered but there was no evidence of settlement proceeds being disbursed to the client. After confronting Mr. Reseburg, who denied knowledge of the files, the legal assistant filed a grievance with the Bar Association. The Bar Association conducted an audit of Mr. Reseburgâ€™s trust account for the period of December 1998 through August 2004. The audit disclosed the following conduct, which constituted grounds for discipline:â€¢ Mr. Reseburg failed to maintain adequate records and render appropriate accounts to clients. This included depositing over $66,000 of unidentified funds into the trust account, recording $26,000 of funds in his check register that were never deposited into the trust account, and failing to note in the check register two check disbursements to himself totaling $7,500. At the time of the auditorâ€™s report in November 2005, a number of checks written on the trust account remained outstanding, including two written in October 2003 that were unaccompanied by any records of the settlements. When accounting for installment payments, Mr. Reseburg did not reconcile receipts reported to clients with sums deposited into his trust account, resulting in failure to pay his clients almost $19,000 in settlement proceeds.â€¢ Mr. Reseburg deposited earned fees into his trust account and made inappropriate disbursements of fees from the trust account. This included depositing over $100,000 of earned fees into the trust account, 24 instances in a three-year period where Mr. Reseburg issued checks to himself with no client identification other than â€œattorneyâ€™s fees,â€ several instances where settlement checks had bounced after Mr. Reseburg had disbursed his one-third fee to himself, and incurring over $5,000 of unreimbursed bank charges to the trust account.â€¢ On at least 13 occasions, Mr. Reseburg failed to deposit settlement funds into his trust account, although he continued to pay himself his one-third fee in each of these cases. A total of $104,831 was deposited in this fashion. As of the date of the audit, Mr. Reseburg owed these clients $62,518.68.â€¢ At the time the audit commenced, Mr. Reseburg had a shortfall of $85,547 in his trust account, which he tried to ameliorate in late 2003 by depositing a check for $35,000. Mr. Reseburg did not wait for this check to clear before disbursing amounts owed to his clients. When Mr. Reseburgâ€™s check did not clear, there was an interim period where he used other clientsâ€™ funds to cover his disbursements before depositing a second check.Mr. Reseburgâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of a client paid to a lawyer be deposited into an identifiable interest-bearing trust account and that no funds belonging to the lawyer be deposited therein except as expressly permitted by rule; RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by a client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude or corruption, or any unjustified act of assault or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law.Kevin M.

824.html,12294,Stephen Blanchard,,Suspension,10/12/2006,,"Stephen B. Blanchard (WSBA No. 12294, admitted 1982), of Edmonds, was suspended for six months, effective October 12, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in two matters involving lack of diligence, failure to communicate with clients, trust account irregularities, failure to refund unearned fees, and failure to cooperate with disciplinary investigations.Matter 1: In January 1997, a married couple [Mr. and Mrs. W] hired Mr. Blanchard to help them collect on $187,592.87 in loans owed to them by one of Mrs. Wâ€™s sons. The loans were consolidated into a single promissory note secured by deeds of trust on three pieces of property. In 1996, the son had filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and had failed to make payments on the promissory note. Through the bankruptcy, two of the properties were sold, while the third property [Lot A] remained part of the bankruptcy estate. Mr. Blanchard told the clients that he would charge an hourly fee for the collection matter. At the end of January, Mr. Blanchard sent Mr. W a $1,578.92 bill for fees relating to a prior representation. Mr. W sent Mr. Blanchard a check for $1,500, which contained the handwritten note â€œAdvance on Legal Service.â€ Mr. Blanchard deposited the check into his general account, not his trust account. At the end of February 1997, Mr. Blanchard sent Mr. W a $229.71 bill for additional fees.In October 1998, Mr. Blanchard requested $1,000 from Mr. and Mrs. W so that he could seek authorization for the sale of Lot A. Mr. Blanchard received the check and deposited it into his general account, but he did not pursue the foreclosure on Lot A. In April 1999, Mr. W died. Mrs. W and her other son met with Mr. Blanchard in August 1999, during which she requested paperwork regarding the money her husband had paid to Mr. Blanchard. Mr. Blanchard said he would send an accounting. He did not provide an accounting or any paperwork regarding the money paid, and he had no further contact with Mrs. W.Between 1999 and 2001, Mrs. Wâ€™s son wrote five letters to Mr. Blanchard requesting an accounting and a refund. Mr. Blanchard received all five letters, but failed to respond or provide an accounting or refund. Mr. Blanchard did not have any records to demonstrate that he earned the $770.29 difference that was paid in October 1998 in excess of the $229.71 billed. In March 2001, Mrs. Wâ€™s sonâ€™s bankruptcy closed and Lot A was distributed back to him. Subsequently, another lawyer assisted Mrs. W in foreclosing the deed of trust. In December 2001, Mrs. W filed a grievance with the Bar Association and was referred to fee arbitration. Mr. Blanchard failed to respond to Mrs. Wâ€™s fee arbitration petition, and she renewed the grievance in November 2002. Mr. Blanchard did not respond to the grievance until served with a subpoena duces tecum.Matter 2: In August 2002, a client hired Mr. Blanchard to represent him in a dissolution action. The client informed Mr. Blanchard that he wished the dissolution to move along as quickly as possible. The primary issue was the division of the partiesâ€™ property. Mr. Blanchard and the client agreed that Mr. Blanchard would charge an hourly fee of $175 per hour. No written fee agreement was executed. The client paid Mr. Blanchard an initial $750. At the end of August, Mr. Blanchard had the client sign dissolution pleadings he had prepared. On the same day, Mr. Blanchard filed the summons and petition for dissolution. However, the petition did not contain the clientâ€™s signature. Mr. Blanchard never filed a petition that was signed by the client.The lawyer representing the opposing party informed Mr. Blanchard that her client would not accept service of the summons and petition and that he needed to properly serve her client. Between October and December 2002, the opposing attorney sent Mr. Blanchard three letters reminding Mr. Blanchard that her client had yet to be served. Mr. Blanchardâ€™s client repeatedly informed Mr. Blanchard that he wanted the case to move forward quickly and that he would not put up with stalling tactics. The client also repeatedly asked Mr. Blanchard to take action to secure personal items that remained in the opposing partyâ€™s possession. Mr. Blanchard did not serve the opposing party and did not file a motion for the return of his clientâ€™s personal property.Around October 2002, Mr. Blanchard requested $1,500 from the client without providing a billing statement. The client, thinking the money was for the costs of a deposition of the opposing party, provided the sum to Mr. Blanchard, who deposited the payment into his general account. Mr. Blanchard attempted to schedule the deposition, but opposing counsel would not allow her client to be deposed until the summons and petition had been properly served. When the deposition was canceled, Mr. Blanchardâ€™s client learned for the first time that the summons and petition had never been served.After hiring a new lawyer, the client also learned that the petition for dissolution was unsigned and invalid. In January 2003, the client sent a letter to Mr. Blanchard informing him that he no longer wished to use his services and requesting a refund. Although Mr. Blanchard originally indicated that he would give the client a refund, he later informed him that he would not refund any money. The client filed a grievance with the Bar Association. Because Mr. Blanchard failed to respond, disciplinary counsel was obliged to issue a subpoenas duces tecum in order to obtain the requested information.Mr. Blanchardâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable; RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm, including advances for costs and expenses, be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and that no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein; RPC 1.14(b), requiring a lawyer to promptly notify a client of the receipt of his or her properties, identify and label client property on receipt and put it in a safe deposit box or other place of safekeeping as soon as possible; maintain complete records of all client property coming into the lawyerâ€™s possession, and promptly pay or deliver to the client property in the lawyerâ€™s possession which the client is entitled to receive; RPC 1.15(d); requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct [here, ELC 1.5 and 5.3].Natalea Skvir and Marsha A.

This discipline was based on his conduct in multiple matters involving the communication of false information to clients and commission of multiple acts of forgery. Mr. Adams is to be distinguished from William Douglas Adams of New Berlin and William Grey Adams of Carnation.Between 2003 and 2005, Mr. Adams represented clients in four unrelated matters. Two of the matters were adoptions, and two were marital dissolutions. Mr. Adams took little or no action to pursue or complete the cases. In two of the matters, Mr. Adams never filed papers to initiate the cases and did not tell the clients that there were no pending proceedings. Eventually, Mr. Adams persuaded each client that the matter was final by fabricating and providing the client with a fake decree, in some instances bearing the forged signature of a superior court judge.In 2006, Mr. Adams pleaded guilty to four felony counts of forgery. He was sentenced to serve a total of four months in jail and to pay restitution to the clients.Mr. Adamsâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any unjustified act of assault or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law.Joanne S.

This discipline was based on his conduct involving allegations of neglect, trust account violations, conflicts of interest, practicing law while suspended, and non-cooperation in a disciplinary investigation. For more information, see Oregon State Bar Bulletin, Discipline (November 2004), available at www.osbar.org/publications/bulletin/archive.html.Mr. Gallagherâ€™s conduct violated Oregon DR 1-102(A)(3), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; DR 1-103(C), requiring a lawyer who is the subject of a disciplinary investigation to respond fully and truthfully to inquiries from and comply with reasonable requests of a tribunal or other authority empowered to investigate or act upon the conduct of lawyers; DR 3-101(B), prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction where to do so would be in violation of the regulations of the profession in that jurisdiction; DR 5-105(C), prohibiting a lawyer who has represented a client in a matter from subsequently representing another client in the same or a significantly related matter when the interests of the current and former clients are in actual or likely conflict; DR 5-105(E), prohibiting a lawyer from representing multiple current clients in any matter when such representation would result in an actual or likely conflict; DR 6-101(B), prohibiting a lawyer from neglecting a legal matter entrusted to the lawyer; DR 9-101(A), requiring all funds paid to a lawyer or law firm to be deposited or maintained in one or more identifiable trust accounts in the state in which the law office is situated; and DR 9-101(C)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to the lawyerâ€™s client regarding them.Felice P.

828.html,29192,Carlos Valero,,Disbarment,4/6/2006,,"Carlos Valero (WSBA No. 29192, admitted 1999), of Spokane, was disbarred, effective April 6, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on Mr. Valeroâ€™s conduct in 2003 and 2004 in a number of matters involving multiple acts of misconduct.It is pertinent to several of the matters that Mr. Valero was previously suspended from the practice of law by order of the Supreme Court dated October 22, 2003, effective December 1, 2003.Matter 1: Between May and September 2003, Mr. Valero, who was not licensed to practice law in Idaho, met with a client on seven different occasions regarding a family law action filed in Idaho, accepted a $100 fee from the client, and appeared on the clientâ€™s behalf in Idaho court. Mr. Valero told the Idaho court that he would be filing a notice of appearance, a pro hac vice application, and the necessary pretrial documents by mid-November 2003, all of which he failed to do. Mediation was set for December 1, 2003, and trial was set for December 8, 2003. Mr. Valero failed to meet any of the pretrial deadlines. He subsequently advised the mediator that he would file a pro hac vice motion, associate with Idaho counsel, and represent his client through the mediation. Mr. Valero did not advise the court, the mediator, or opposing counsel about his imminent suspension. After December 1, 2003, Mr. Valero did not cease practicing law. On December 2, Mr. Valero faxed a number of trial documents to opposing counsel. By letter on his law office letterhead, Mr. Valero subsequently advised opposing counsel that he would no longer be representing his client.Matter 2: In a family law action pending in late 2004, Mr. Valero did not notify the opposing lawyer, his client, or the court of his imminent suspension. Mr. Valero did not file a notice of withdrawal with the court after he was suspended. Following the commencement of his suspension, Mr. Valero had several telephone conversations with his client, during which they substantively discussed the case. Mr. Valero told the client that he was very busy and that another lawyer had agreed to assist him on the case. Until she received a fee agreement from the new lawyer and telephoned the new lawyerâ€™s office in early 2004, the client had no knowledge that Mr. Valero was suspended.Matter 3: In January 2003, Mr. Valero was hired by clients to pursue a breach-of-contract claim against a Spokane business. The clients signed a fee agreement and paid Mr. Valero $10,000, characterized in the fee agreement as a â€œnon[-]refundable advance flat fee retainer.â€ The clients believed the payment to be an advance fee that would be refunded if Mr. Valero did not do the work for them. Mr. Valero deposited the money into his own account. During the representation, Mr. Valero failed to return several phone calls from the clients and did not appear for scheduled meetings. At one point, he told the clients that he hired a detective, that the detective had discovered that the defendants owned 13 pieces of real property, that he was working on placing liens on these properties, and that he had served the defendants with a notice to appear in court. Mr. Valero had done none of these things. After receiving a letter from the clients in which they requested an itemized bill, copies of the liens, and the return of some original documents, Mr. Valero denied having ever told the clients that a detective had discovered property owned by the defendants. In August 2003, the clients went to Mr. Valeroâ€™s office to demand the return of their original documents and property, some of which he failed to return. Subsequently, the clients again demanded an itemized billing statement. As Mr. Valero did not keep track of the time he had spent on their legal matter, he recreated a billing statement showing that he had spent $9,292.50 of attorney time on their case, and he sent the bill to the clients. He also sent them a copy of a proposed complaint, which he asked the clients to sign and return to him. The clients refused to sign the complaint, did not authorize the complaint to be filed, and did not communicate further with Mr. Valero. In November 2003, Mr. Valero filed the complaint in superior court. The complaint named a number of individuals as defendants, along with a business and several insurance and bonding companies. None of the individual defendants were served, and owing to lack of specificity in naming the business-entity defendant, the incorrect bonding company was served. On or after December 1, 2003, a claims representative contacted Mr. Valero and advised him that they had had no business dealings with the named plaintiffs and were therefore wrongfully served. Mr. Valero responded that he would investigate the matter, but took no further steps to ensure that the incorrectly named party was dismissed from the action. He later told the representative that another lawyer was representing his clients, which was untrue. Mr. Valero did not inform the representative, his clients, any opposing party or counsel, or the court that he was suspended from the practice of law. In December 2003, a lawyer wrote a letter to Mr. Valero asking him to dismiss the lawsuit against the incorrectly named party. Mr. Valero did not respond or take any action after receiving the letter, nor did he inform the lawyer that he was suspended. In January 2004, Mr. Valero told the lawyer that he would agree to dismiss the lawsuit after consulting with his clients, but he took no further action. The lawyer then informed Mr. Valero that if the suit was not voluntarily dismissed, he would commence summary judgment proceedings and seek attorney fees. In a subsequent telephone conversation, Mr. Valero told the lawyer that he would dismiss the lawsuit, but that he was withdrawing from the case and another lawyer would be taking over. He did not provide a reason for withdrawal or identify the new lawyer. A summary judgment motion was filed against Mr. Valeroâ€™s clients and served on Mr. Valero, as he was still the clientsâ€™ attorney of record. Mr. Valero did not tell the clients about the motion. Neither Mr. Valero, nor anyone else on behalf of Mr. Valeroâ€™s clients, responded to the motion or appeared at the hearing. After determining that Mr. Valero was suspended, the judge rescheduled the hearing. Mr. Valero was sent a notice indicating that the motion had been rescheduled. Mr. Valero did not tell the clients that the motion had been rescheduled. Neither Mr. Valero, nor anyone else on behalf of Mr. Valeroâ€™s clients, responded or appeared at the rescheduled hearing, and the judge dismissed the complaint with prejudice, awarding the moving party attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. In June 2004, opposing counsel began garnishment proceedings against the clientsâ€™ bank account for a total of $955.00. The clients subsequently paid the judgment against them.Matter 4: In August 2004, Mr. Valero agreed to represent a client in a criminal matter for a $2,000 flat fee. Mr. Valero did not tell the client that he was suspended from the practice of law. After meeting with the client several times and offering legal advice about the case, Mr. Valero accepted a $200 payment towards the flat fee. When the client requested that Mr. Valero appear with him at an upcoming court hearing, Mr. Valero explained that another lawyer would be more successful before the assigned judge and would appear at the hearing. While waiting in the courtroom for his lawyer to appear, the client heard the court commissioner tell another defendant that Mr. Valero was suspended from the practice of law. Neither Mr. Valero, nor the other lawyer Mr. Valero had named, arrived in the courtroom by the time the clientâ€™s case was called. The clientâ€™s subsequent attempts to contact Mr. Valero were unsuccessful.Matter 5: In July 2004, while Mr. Valero was suspended from the practice of law, a client hired him to handle both a criminal and a child custody matter. The client paid to Mr. Valero at least $800 towards an agreed-upon $1,500 flat fee. In late July or early August 2004, Mr. Valero prepared and signed a variety of pleadings in the case, which had previously been commenced in superior court. Mr. Valero drove the client and his mother to the courthouse to attend the clientâ€™s dependency hearing. During the drive, Mr. Valero and the client substantively discussed both of the clientâ€™s cases. While at the courthouse, Mr. Valero identified himself as the clientâ€™s lawyer to a Child Protective Services representative, the appointed GAL, his clientâ€™s court-appointed lawyer, and the assigned assistant attorney general. Mr. Valero engaged each of these persons in conversation about his clientâ€™s case and proposed changes to the parenting plan. He did not tell any of these persons, or his client, that he was suspended from the practice of law. At the courthouse, Mr. Valero accompanied his client and clientâ€™s mother to the clerkâ€™s office to file the pleadings he had prepared. Prior to filing the pleadings, Mr. Valero used white-out to cover his signature and directed his client to sign the documents in the area over which he had used white-out. The clientâ€™s pretrial hearing on the criminal charges was set for September 2004. Mr. Valero told his client that he would appear with him at the hearing and advised him to plead not guilty to the charges. On the day of the hearing, Mr. Valero did not meet with his client at the courthouse at the appointed time. When Mr. Valeroâ€™s client told the court the name of his lawyer, the presiding judge informed the client that Mr. Valero was suspended from practicing law and could not represent him. In October or November 2004, Mr. Valero contacted his client and asked him to come to his house, where he asked him to sign a declaration. The declaration stated that the client had been confused when he told the court that he had hired Mr. Valero to represent him on his criminal case. The client refused to sign the declaration because it was false.Matter 6: Between January and August 2004, the Bar Association directed Mr. Valero to respond to the grievances filed against him in Matters 1, 2, and 3. Because Mr. Valero failed to respond, disciplinary counsel was obliged to issue subpoenas duces tecum in order to obtain the responses.Mr. Valeroâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.2, requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable; RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer be deposited into an interest-bearing trust account; RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by a client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive; RPC 1.15(a)(1), requiring a lawyer to withdraw from representing a client if the representation will result in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law; RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer upon termination of representation to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests; RPC 5.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction where doing so violates the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction; RPC 5.5(e), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in the practice of law while on inactive status, or while suspended from the practice of law for any cause; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, theft in the second degree, witness tampering, and attempting to suborn perjury) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any unjustified act of assault or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; RPC 8.4(j), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order directing him or her to do or cease doing an act which he or she ought in good faith to do or forbear; RPC 8.4(k), prohibiting a lawyer from violating his or her oath as an attorney, and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here, ELC 1.5, 5.3(e), 14.1, and 14.2).Leslie C.

829.html,21239,Robert Hayes,,Reprimand,9/29/2006,,"Robert L. Hayes (WSBA No. 21239, admitted 1991), of Tacoma, was ordered to receive a reprimand on September 29, 2006, following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2003 involving a conflict of interest.In May 2003, a Washington resident died intestate leaving three adult children:  Child A, Child B, and Child C.  The three children had grown up in the same neighborhood with Mr. Hayes, and Child A had maintained contact with Mr. Hayes after high school.  To save money, the siblings initially did not retain the services of a lawyer to help them prepare court papers or assist them with the administration of the estate.  On May 21, a superior court commissioner appointed Child B, who had no prior experience administering an estate, to be the administrator. Soon after that, Child A began calling and writing to Child B, demanding a full accounting and requiring her to perform services. In June 2003, Child A telephoned Mr. Hayes and asked Mr. Hayes to assist both him and Child C by reviewing the superior court probate file and intervening with Child B to require her to provide an accounting. In a letter confirming the telephone call, Child A informed Mr. Hayes that both he and Child C decided they needed Mr. Hayesâ€™s â€œhelp and assistanceâ€ in dealing with Child B. Child A enclosed a personal check in the amount of $250. Child A signed the letter as â€œyour friend, although now I guess client.â€ Mr. Hayes went to the courthouse, reviewed the probate file, and confirmed by telephone with Child A that he had received the check for $250. Mr. Hayes reported to Child A that there had been no new activity in the court file since the probate documents were filed in May. Mr. Hayes then wrote a letter to Child B on behalf of Child A requesting a full accounting of the estate assets, a copy of a power of attorney the decedent had executed to Child B before her death, and information about transactions under the power of attorney. At the end of June, Child B wrote to her two siblings and included some receipts and summaries of their motherâ€™s assets. She also forwarded to them a letter that she had sent to Mr. Hayes asking him to represent her as administrator of the estate.In July 2003, Child A and Mr. Hayes talked by phone. At Mr. Hayesâ€™s direction, Child A confirmed in writing that the $250 check was â€œan advance prepayment . . . for legal representation of the estate of [the decedent] where [Child B] is the Administrator.â€ That same month, Mr. Hayes and Child B entered into a written fee agreement which referenced the $250 as a â€œretainer fee paid . . . in advance.â€ In July 2003, Child A wrote to Mr. Hayes and thanked him for helping Child B as administrator of the estate. In August, Child A wrote to Child B that he was â€œglad that [Mr. Hayes] is helping you.â€ Child A was aware that Mr. Hayes was no longer his personal lawyer but was performing legal services on behalf of Child B as the estate administrator. By these actions, Child A expressly agreed and consented to Mr. Hayesâ€™s representation of Child B as administrator.Two months later, Child A wrote Child B a letter stating that she was being unfair and had still not provided a full accounting of the estate assets to him.  He also filed a pro se petition to remove Child B as administrator of the estate. Mr. Hayes, on behalf of Child B, filed a declaration in opposition to the petition. In November 2003, the court commissioner ordered the appointment of a substitute independent administrator. In December, Mr. Hayes signed a fee agreement and filed a notice of appearance to represent Child B â€œin her individual capacity as an heir to her motherâ€™s estate.â€ Child A never consented to Mr. Hayesâ€™s representation of Child B in her individual capacity as heir.In January 2004, Child A wrote to Mr. Hayes asking him for a refund of the $250 he had sent him in June 2003. Child A stated that Mr. Hayesâ€™s bill to the estate indicated that he had only spent one hour drafting the letter to Child B on Child Aâ€™s behalf, and therefore Mr. Hayes should only be entitled to receive $90 (his hourly fee). Mr. Hayes responded that he did not owe him a $160 refund and that the $250 payment had been credited equally among the three heirs to the estate. Child A filed a motion in the probate proceeding in which he raised the issue of Mr. Hayesâ€™s representation of Child B by stating that he and Child C would not release or waive Mr. Hayesâ€™s potential conflict of interest arising from his representation of Child B individually in the probate matter.In January 2004, the commissioner appointed a new personal representative. An order approving final account and a decree of distribution were filed in March 2005. As part of the distribution, Child A was refunded the $250 fee paid to Mr. Hayes.Mr. Hayesâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.9(a), prohibiting a lawyer from representing another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that personâ€™s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client consents in writing after consultation and a full disclosure of the material facts.Kevin M.

83.html,18979,Peter Lukevich,,Censure,3/28/2002,,"Peter M. Lukevich (WSBA No. 18979, admitted 1989), of Seattle, received a censure on March 28, 2002, following a hearing. This discipline is based upon his failure to explain a matter to his client to the extent necessary for the client to make informed decisions, and failure to act with diligence and promptness from 1996 to 1999.On May 31, 1996, Ms. P retained Mr. Lukevich to represent her in an employment claim against the Municipal Court of Seattle. Ms. P and Mr. Lukevich entered a contingency-fee agreement with a $5,000 nonrefundable retainer.Prior to hiring Mr. Lukevich, another lawyer represented Ms. P and filed a lawsuit on her behalf, alleging wages owed and gender discrimination. The case proceeded to a bench trial in 1995, but was declared a mistrial when a witness was found to be a close acquaintance. The trial was rescheduled for June 1997. Ms. P informed Mr. Lukevich that she wanted a jury trial, and Mr. Lukevich agreed to file a jury demand, but did not do so.In March and April 1997, Ms. P left messages for Mr. Lukevich inquiring about her case status, but he did not respond in a timely manner. Shortly before June 1997, one of Ms. Pâ€™s experts suffered a stroke, and Mr. Lukevich asked for a continuance, which the court denied. With Ms. P, Mr. Lukevich discussed going to trial without the expert, or dismissing and refiling the lawsuit. Mr. Lukevich advised Ms. P she had additional time under the statute of limitations to refile, though the three-year statute of limitations had expired. Ms. P agreed to dismiss and refile.On June 5, 1997, Mr. Lukevich filed a motion and stipulation of the parties for voluntary nonsuit, and the suit was dismissed. On August 13, 1997, Mr. Lukevich refiled the lawsuit and trial was set for January 1999. Ms. P asked Mr. Lukevich to file an amended complaint to include incidents of retaliation after the initial lawsuit, to file a jury demand, and to depose witnesses regarding her retaliation claims. Mr. Lukevich agreed to do all three, but did not do so. Ms. P specifically asked Mr. Lukevich to depose Court Administrator K because he was very ill and was unlikely to survive until the time of trial. Mr. Lukevich agreed, but he did not depose Mr. K before his death in December 1998.Ms. P wrote to Mr. Lukevich at least six times between February and November 1998, and repeatedly made calls expressing her concerns regarding his representation and requesting information. Mr. Lukevich did not respond in a timely manner and did not provide complete responses. In response to one message on October 19, 1998, Mr. Lukevich assured Ms. P everything was under control.On October 22, 1998, the city filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing in part that Ms. Pâ€™s claims were barred by the three-year statute of limitations. On October 26, Mr. Lukevich left a message for Ms. P assuring her he would work on the motion. Concerned that Mr. Lukevich was not attending to her case, Ms. P hired attorney Ms. R. Ms. P asked Mr. Lukevich to work with Ms. R, but he did not respond.On November 9, 1998, Mr. Lukevich and Ms. R filed separate responses to the motion for summary judgment. Ms. Râ€™s response included a request for continuance based on Mr. Lukevichâ€™s alleged inadequate representation. On November 16, the court granted the continuance. On November 22, Mr. Lukevich wrote to Ms. R, stating he intended to withdraw from representation. On November 23, Ms. P wrote to Mr. Lukevich requesting a refund of $5,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees; however, Mr. Lukevich did not refund her fees. On November 30, Mr. Lukevich filed a notice of withdrawal and substitution of counsel. On May 24, 1999, the court issued an order partially granting the motion for summary judgment, and dismissed with prejudice all of Ms. Pâ€™s claims based on acts prior to August 13, 1994. The lawsuit was settled in June 1999.Mr. Lukevichâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3 and 1.4(b), requiring lawyers to act with diligence and explain matters to the extent reasonably necessary to permit clients to make informed decisions; 1.4(a), requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters and to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and 1.2, 1.3 and 3.2, requiring lawyers to abide by clientsâ€™ decisions regarding the objectives of representation, act with diligence, and expedite litigation.Marsha Matsumoto represented the Bar Association.

830.html,23508,Sandra Zupanski,,Suspension,11/14/2006,,"Sandra M. Zupanski (WSBA No. 23508, admitted 1994), of Seattle, was suspended for three years, effective November 14, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on her conduct between 1996 and 2005 involving trust-account irregularities, misrepresentations to clients, false statements in connection with a disciplinary investigation, and failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation.From July 1996 through August 2005, Ms. Zupanski maintained an IOLTA trust account and was solely responsible for maintaining her trust-account records. During this period, Ms. Zupanski used only a handwritten check register to keep track of trust-account funds and did not record all the transactions in the register. Many of the recorded transactions were incomplete, did not indicate a client matter, or were illegible. Ms. Zupanski wrote approximately 230 checks to herself with no client referenced on either the check or the check register. For most of this time period, Ms. Zupanski did not keep a running balance on her check register. She did not maintain client ledgers, did not reconcile her IOLTA checkbook register to the bank statements, and kept only some of the bank statements she received for her trust account. On approximately 46 separate occasions, Ms. Zupanski deposited her own funds into the trust account. She either deposited into the trust account or failed to promptly remove approximately $85,475 in earned fees. For a substantial period of time, Ms. Zupanski did not have any bank accounts other than her trust account. Ms. Zupanski repeatedly used the trust account to pay for personal expenses and arranged for automatic monthly deductions for personal expenses.Between 1999 and 2005, Ms. Zupanski represented a client in connection with a Labor and Industries (L&I) claim. The agreed-upon fee entitled Ms. Zupanski to 10 percent of each time-loss payment. The remaining 90 percent of each time-loss payment belonged to the client. Ms. Zupanski failed to pay the client his share in a timely fashion and did not pay the client his share of 16 L&I payments, totaling $10,157.01. Between September 2001 and August 2002, Ms. Zupanski indicated on the clientâ€™s checks a time-loss period earlier than that of the most recent L&I check she had received. In August 2002, Ms. Zupanski was over two months behind in her payments to the client and, in a letter, made misrepresentations to the client about the status of the funds in her possession.Between 1998 and 2000, Ms. Zupanski settled personal-injury matters for three clients. Settlement statements in each matter reflected that funds would be withheld to reimburse third-party creditors. The checks Ms. Zupanski sent to the third parties were for amounts less than what was listed on the settlement statements. Ms. Zupanski did not pay the clients in each of these matters the full difference between the amount reflected in the settlement statements and the amount actually paid to the third party. In a statement submitted to the Bar Association, Ms. Zupanski falsely stated that she had used non-trust-account funds to reimburse one of the clients for the difference between the amount withheld and the amount paid to the third party.In August 2005, the Bar Association deposed Ms. Zupanski in connection with a trust-account overdraft notice. Ms. Zupanski did not timely provide all the information or documents requested by disciplinary counsel.Ms. Zupanskiâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm, including advances for costs and expenses, be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and that no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein; RPC 1.14(b)(1), requiring a lawyer to promptly notify a client of the receipt of his or her funds, securities, or other properties; RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by a client the funds, securities, or other properties to which the client is entitled to receive, RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter (here, ELC 5.3).Anne I.

831.html,18816,Joe Wickersham,,Reprimand,9/21/2006,,"Joe Wickersham (WSBA No. 18816, admitted 1989), of Renton, was ordered to receive a reprimand on September 21, 2006, following a stipulation approved by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2005 involving an unreasonable fee and a prohibited division of fee.In January 2005, Mr. Wickersham agreed to represent a defendant in three criminal cases pending in municipal court. Mr. Wickersham was hired by the defendantâ€™s father, who signed a fee agreement indicating that Mr. Wickersham was to be paid a total of $5,000 for the representation. The defendantâ€™s father paid $1,500 that day. The fee agreement indicated the remaining $3,500 was to be paid within 30 days and included the following relevant paragraphs:1. The Client hires the Attorney [Law Office of Joe Wickersham] and have [sic] entered into a contract wherein the Client has agreed to pay the attorney $5,000 for Des Moines DV charges â€“ 3. If the case proceeds to Jury/Bench Trial, including the preparation and appearing at court on day of trial, an additional fee of $350.00 per hour will be charged . . . .7. The Client also agrees to allow the attorney to associate with another attorney and delegate any work to another attorney, as the attorney is inclined to do. Neither Mr. Wickersham, nor anyone who worked in his office, ever met or spoke with the defendant, filed a notice of appearance in the defendantâ€™s case, or did any work on those cases. Mr. Wickersham contacted a sole practitioner working in another office and asked her to appear at the defendantâ€™s next court hearing. This lawyer (hereinafter â€œsurrogate lawyerâ€) agreed to handle the defendantâ€™s cases. She appeared in court and filed a notice of appearance on the defendantâ€™s behalf. These notices made no mention of Mr. Wickersham. In February 2005, Mr. Wickersham sent the surrogate lawyer a letter that read as follows:Enclosed is a check in the amount of $500.00 for your representation of [defendantâ€™s] three Des Moines DV matters.As discussed, this payment represents all fees that will be paid to you by our office for your representation. Per the Fee Agreement, you can bill the client $350.00 per hour for trial and trial preparation.The surrogate lawyer was unaware of the specifics of the fee agreement between Mr. Wickersham and the defendantâ€™s father. She understood that she was representing the defendant up to trial for $500 and could bill him for additional fees if a case went to trial. Mr. Wickersham never spoke with the defendant and the defendantâ€™s father about this arrangement, did not assume joint responsibility for representation of the defendant, and did not perform any duties on the defendantâ€™s behalf. Nonetheless, Mr. Wickersham kept $1,000 of the original fee payment. Mr. Wickershamâ€™s office sought payment of the remaining $3,500 from the defendantâ€™s father by sending him monthly amount-due notices. Mr. Wickersham was not aware that his staff was sending these bills. The surrogate lawyer continued to represent the defendant until June 2005, when another lawyer substituted for her. Subsequently, a public defender was appointed to represent the defendant.Mr. Wickershamâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.5(a), requiring that a lawyerâ€™s fee be reasonable; and RPC 1.5(e)(2), allowing a division of fees between lawyers who are not in the same firm to be made only if the division is in proportion to the services provided by each lawyer or, by written agreement with the client, each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation, the client is advised of and does not object to the participation of all the lawyers involved, and the total fee is reasonable.M.

832.html,24044,Michael Karber,,Reprimand,3/22/2006,,"Michael R. Karber (WSBA No. 24044, admitted 1994), of Tempe, Arizona, was ordered to receive two reprimands on May 22, 2006, following a stipulation approved by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on his conduct involving failure to put a contingent-fee agreement in writing and trust-account irregularities.Mr. Karber represented a client in a lawsuit to recover for damage to the clientâ€™s pond. The client had been previously represented by another lawyer in the matter. Mr. Karber and the client agreed to a 25 percent contingent fee with a cash advance of $4,000. Although Mr. Karber was aware of the requirement that agreements for contingent fees be in writing, he neglected to put the contingent-fee agreement in writing. In April 2004, the matter settled at mediation when two insurance carriers agreed to pay $25,000 each. As part of the mediation, the client agreed to give her previous lawyer a lien of $1,500 on the settlement proceeds. An environmental expert involved in the matter agreed to limit her charges to $13,000, provided that the remaining balance of $9,000 would be paid out of the proceeds of the settlement. Mr. Karber agreed to reduce his fees if necessary to ensure there would be sufficient funds to repair the clientâ€™s pond. At the time, Mr. Karber believed the repairs could be accomplished for a sum that would allow him to collect the full 25 percent contingency fee of $12,500.Mr. Karber deposited the first $25,000 check into his trust account. Mr. Karber paid the environmental expert $9,000, and, with the clientâ€™s consent, he withdrew an additional $1,000 as a fee advance. The second $25,000 check was sent directly to the client. Out of the $15,000 remaining in the trust account, Mr. Karber was entitled to the remainder of his fee, which could have been up to $7,500. However, the exact amount of Mr. Karberâ€™s fee was indeterminate until the cost of repairing the clientâ€™s pond was determined. Mr. Karber intended to assist his client in getting the work contracted. Owing to a medical condition, Mr. Karberâ€™s ability to assist his client was impaired at the time. This, coupled with the unavailability of the environmental expert during this period, led to a failure to obtain a contractor to do the work. Although he was not able to determine the amount of additional fee to which he was entitled, Mr. Karber made a series of disbursements to himself between April and June 2004, totaling $8,100. Mr. Karber did not maintain individual client ledgers or a check register for his trust account, other than carbon copies of the check stubs. Consequently, Mr. Karber had no running balance of his clientâ€™s funds apart from periodic bank statements. Due to his medical condition and the inadequacy of his records, Mr. Karber was not aware that he had taken $600 more than the maximum of fees to which he could have become entitled.In late June 2004, Mr. Karber left the area to seek medical treatment. In November 2004, he relocated to Arizona. Feeling remorse for his inability to assist his client in arranging for the pond repairs, Mr. Karber decided he would refund the client all of her fees absent the $5,000 advances. To accomplish this, Mr. Karber deposited $8,100 of his own funds into his trust account, representing the $7,500 of his fee that he was forgoing and the $600 excess fee disbursement he had taken. Mr. Karber subsequently issued a $13,500 check to the client, retaining $1,500 in his trust account pending resolution of an apparent dispute between his client and her previous lawyer over a $1,500 lien.Mr. Karberâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.5(c)(1), requiring that a contingent-fee agreement be in writing; RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm, including advances for costs and expenses, be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and that no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein; and RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other property of a client coming into the possession of a lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them.Randy V.

834.html,26665,Richard Corbin,,Suspension,1/16/2007,,"Richard H. Corbin (WSBA No. 26665, admitted 1997) of Everett, was suspended for two years, effective January 16, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2004 and 2005 in three matters involving failure to communicate with clients, trust account irregularities, failure to protect a clientâ€™s interests following termination of representation, misrepresentations to clients, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and non-cooperation with a disciplinary investigation.Matter 1: Mr. Corbin prepared a will for a client. The client died in 2004. The clientâ€™s daughter (Child A) provided Mr. Corbin with original documents. She told Mr. Corbin that her brother (Child B) was the estate executor and should be contacted regarding billing. Mr. Corbin agreed to do so, estimating that the probate would take about six months. Over the next few months, Child A attempted to contact Mr. Corbin. He did not respond until November 2004, when he called to say the probate had not been filed because he had not been paid. During this time, Mr. Corbin never communicated with Child B, except to send him a copy of the will. In November 2004, Child A gave Mr. Corbin a check for $1,500, which Mr. Corbin cashed. Over the next few months, Child A and Child B left numerous voicemail and e-mail messages for Mr. Corbin, but were never able to speak to him directly. In both January and April 2005, Mr. Corbin left messages on Child Aâ€™s voicemail informing her that the probate would be taken care of in a few weeks. In fact, Mr. Corbin had not filed the probate and his representations about the status of the probate were untrue. After Child B filed a grievance with the Bar Association, Mr. Corbin left him a message asking if he or his sister was the executor (something they had told him many times) and for a list of his motherâ€™s creditors (which Child A had previously provided). Child B responded promptly and tried repeatedly to contact Mr. Corbin, but was unable to reach him. Occasionally, Mr. Corbin would leave a message stating he was working on the case and that things were progressing well. In August 2005, the Supreme Court suspended Mr. Corbin for nonpayment of dues. At that time, Mr. Corbin had still not filed the probate, nor had he refunded any legal fees or returned any original documents to Child A or Child B. Child B hired a new lawyer, who attempted to contact Mr. Corbin. Mr. Corbin failed to respond or turn over the original documents. As a result, the estate incurred additional fees because the new lawyer had to file the probate documents using duplicates attested to by witnesses of the original will. Subsequently, Mr. Corbinâ€™s family refunded Child A and Child B the $1,500 in legal fees paid to Mr. Corbin.Matter 2: In 2004, Mr. Corbin was hired to assist a client with estate planning for her parents. In Mr. Corbinâ€™s office, the client signed a quitclaim deed as attorney in fact for her mother, who was affected by Alzheimerâ€™s disease, but Mr. Corbin did not record it. The client also provided Mr. Corbin with a spousal agreement signed by her parents and a durable power of attorney. In April 2005, the clientâ€™s father died and she became executor of his estate. The client tried many times to communicate with Mr. Corbin to obtain her original documents. The client subsequently hired a new lawyer, who tried to communicate multiple times with Mr. Corbin. Occasionally, Mr. Corbin would leave voicemail messages indicating that he had received the calls, but he did not return the clientâ€™s documents. The new lawyer ultimately filed a petition with the superior court seeking an order requiring Mr. Corbin to return the clientâ€™s original documents. The court issued a citation for Mr. Corbin to appear at a show cause hearing. Mr. Corbin did not appear. The court issued a second citation directing Mr. Corbin to appear at a hearing with the documents and show cause why he should not be required to pay the clientâ€™s legal fees. Mr. Corbin did not appear. The court found Mr. Corbin in contempt and issued a bench warrant. The clientâ€™s new lawyer proceeded with the probate based on the available documentation, resulting in additional expense to the client. The Bar Association subsequently obtained the clientâ€™s file and provided it to her, at which time the bench warrant was quashed. Mr. Corbin entered into a stipulated judgment to pay the client $8,803.15 in restitution. Mr. Corbin satisfied the judgment.Matter 3: In April 2004, clients hired Mr. Corbin to file an offer and compromise with the IRS because they owed back taxes. They paid Mr. Corbin $1,500. Over the next 18 months, the clients repeatedly tried to reach Mr. Corbin by phone, in person, and through letters. Mr. Corbin responded only once, stating he had family problems and would attend to their case promptly. Because Mr. Corbin failed to take any action on the clientsâ€™ behalf, the IRS began garnishing one of the clientâ€™s monthly Social Security disability payments. The clients needed original papers in Mr. Corbinâ€™s possession in order to address the garnishment issue, but they were unable to retrieve them from him. The clients eventually hired a tax professional, who wrote to Mr. Corbin to request the client file and a refund of the fee. Mr. Corbin did not respond. The Bar Association subsequently obtained the file and provided it to the clients. Mr. Corbinâ€™s family refunded the $1,500 fee.After failing to promptly respond to the grievances that arose out of the above-described matters and failing to appear at a deposition as required by subpoena, Mr. Corbin was suspended by the Supreme Court for failure to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation.Mr. Corbinâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as, inter alia, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter (here, ELC 5.3(e)).Joanne S.

836.html,21452,Michael Riley,,Disbarment,1/17/2007,,"Michael O. Riley (WSBA No. 21452, admitted 1992) of Tukwila, was disbarred, effective January 17, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2004 and 2005 in three matters involving lack of diligence, failure to communicate with clients, unreasonable fees, trust account irregularities, failure to refund unearned fees and return property to a client, commission of a criminal act, dishonesty, and non-cooperation with disciplinary investigations.Matter 1: Mr. Riley was hired to represent a client in a dissolution matter. When the case was resolved, Mr. Riley and the client agreed that Mr. Riley would receive $4,000 from the proceeds to cover unpaid attorneyâ€™s fees and fees for possible future representation in connection with post-dissolution motions. In July 2004, Mr. Riley received two checks from the counsel for the opposing party. One check was payable to Mr. Riley for $4,000 and the other, for the balance of the proceeds, was payable to the client. Although he had only earned at most $2,916.65, Mr. Riley deposited the entire $4,000 into his business account. After July 2004, Mr. Riley did not earn any fees from the client or expend any funds on her behalf. The client terminated Mr. Rileyâ€™s services and requested a refund of the balance of her funds. Mr. Riley did not refund any money to her. At the end of July 2004, Mr. Riley was suspended from the practice of law for nonpayment of dues. He did not notify the client of his suspension or respond to numerous messages left by the client in August and September. In October 2004, Mr. Riley told the client that a refund of $1,093.35 would be available at the beginning of November. In November 2004, the client filed a grievance with the Bar Association. Mr. Riley intentionally did not provide the client with her funds until February 2005. Matter 2: In March 2004, a client hired Mr. Riley regarding a contractorâ€™s lien on the clientâ€™s property. Although Mr. Riley advised the client that the problem would be resolved by July, Mr. Riley neither performed any work that benefited the client nor responded to numerous requests for information on the status of the matter. Mr. Riley also did not inform the client in writing of his July 2004 suspension. During the summer of 2004, the client went to Mr. Rileyâ€™s office four times to determine the status of his matter. Mr. Riley was present only on one of those four occasions and informed the client that he could not talk to him because his license had temporarily been suspended.Matter 3: In February 2005, a Texas resident hired Mr. Riley to handle a probate matter. The clientâ€™s father had died the previous year. The client was named as personal representative in the will. Mr. Riley agreed to handle the probate matter for $2,000, and he sent the client a fee agreement describing the $2,000 as a â€œfully earned fee.â€ The client signed the fee agreement and sent it back to Mr. Riley with a check for $2,000, together with the original will. Even though he had not earned any of the funds, Mr. Riley deposited the $2,000 into his business account. Mr. Riley did not perform any work on behalf of the estate and did not respond to the clientâ€™s numerous attempts to contact him by phone, fax, e-mail, and letter. In September 2005, the client sent a certified letter requesting that Mr. Riley return the original will and the fee if he was unable to handle the matter. Mr. Riley did not respond. In October 2005, the client filed a grievance against Mr. Riley with the Bar Association.In the three above-described matters, Mr. Riley failed to cooperate with the Bar Association by not providing requested information and documents, by not responding to requests for responses to grievances, by not appearing at a scheduled deposition, and by not producing documents as required by subpoena. During the disciplinary investigation, it was determined that between at least August 2003 and November 2005, Mr. Riley maintained an IOLTA account for which he did not maintain complete records. During that period, Mr. Riley did not record or accurately record 63 trust account transactions, including at least $107,607 of withdrawals. Many of these withdrawals were payable to Mr. Riley or were used to pay for his personal or business expenses. After August 2003, Mr. Riley did not reconcile his trust account records to his bank statement and did not maintain client ledgers for his trust account. Mr. Rileyâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring that a lawyer act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring all funds paid to a lawyer or law firm, including advances for costs and expenses, be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts, and no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein; former RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by the client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any unjustified act of assault or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here, ELC 5.3(e) and 14.1(c)) in connection with a disciplinary matter.Anne I.

This discipline was based on her conduct between September 2001 and October 2002 involving the commission of a criminal act.On November 28, 2005, Ms. Ludington-Green pleaded guilty to theft in the first degree, in violation of RCW 9A.56.030(1)(a) and 9A.56.020(1)(a) and (b), in King County Superior Court. Ms. Ludington-Green was the executive director of a domestic-violence outreach service (DVOS). Between September 2001 and September 2002, Ms. Ludington-Green had sole control of DVOSâ€™s bank statements, debit cards, and PINs, and she was responsible for reconciling its account records. During that period, approximately $20,000 in undocumented or unauthorized withdrawals and expenditures were made from DVOSâ€™s funds. Ms. Ludington-Green used some of those funds to pay her personal debts and some to pay herself for unauthorized and unearned vacation leave, sick leave, and bonuses. Ms. Ludington-Green also forged a check to pay for a non-DVOS-related conference.Ms. Ludington-Greenâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any unjustified act of assault or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; RPC 8.4(k), prohibiting a lawyer from violating his or her oath as an attorney; and RPC 8.4(n), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law.Marsha A.

This discipline was based on his conduct involving submission of a false statement to a tribunal, providing false information during a disciplinary investigation, and trust account irregularities.Between 2002 and 2004, Mr. McCrumb engaged in the following conduct, which established grounds for discipline:â€¢ In a dissolution matter, Mr. McCrumb presented one or more written orders to a court containing significant discrepancies from the court's oral ruling.â€¢ During the Bar Association's disciplinary investigation, Mr. McCrumb intentionally prepared aletter with a false date in an attempt to establish compliance with RPC 1.8, provided falseinformation to a Bar Association investigator about the letter, and testified falsely in a depositionregarding the circumstances of the letter's creation.â€¢ As established by a Bar Association audit of his trust account addressing a period betweenNovember 2002 and December 2003, Mr. McCrumb failed to maintain complete recordsregarding client funds in his possession, failed to deposit client funds to his trust account,disbursed funds of one client on behalf of another client without authorization, on one or moreoccasions removed client funds from his trust account for his own benefit without establishingentitlement to those funds, commingled his own funds with client funds in his trust account, andfailed to render appropriate accounts to his clients regarding funds held in his trust account.Mr. McCrumb's conduct violated former RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited into one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and that no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein; former RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 3.3(a), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

This discipline was based on his conduct between 1998 and 2005 in a number of matters involving multiple acts of misconduct. Mr. Pandherâ€™s conduct establishing grounds for discipline included the following: â€¢ Failing to diligently pursue and protect client interests in three immigration matters and one boundary dispute matter.â€¢ Failing to communicate with clients, making misrepresentations to clients about the status of their cases, failing to respond to client requests for information, and instructing a client not to contact him or the tribunal in order to conceal his own nonfeasance.â€¢ Consulting with an individual about a dissolution matter and then representing the adverse party in the same proceeding without obtaining written consent after a full disclosure of material facts.â€¢ Communicating with a party represented by counsel about subject matter of the representation.â€¢ Continuing to represent a client in an immigration matter despite an inability to communicate with the client owing to a language barrier.â€¢ Misrepresenting facts to an adverse party.â€¢ Failing to communicate to a client the basis, rate, and factors involved in determining the fee charged, charging an unreasonable fee, and charging a fee for which no services were performed.â€¢ Failing to give a client reasonable notice that he was terminating the representation and failing to refund the unearned portion of the fee.

842.html,28994,Gail Schwartz,,Suspension,2/7/2007,,"Gail Schwartz (WSBA No. 28994, admitted 1999), of Spokane, was suspended for six months by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on her conduct involving lack of competence, lack of diligence, failure to expedite litigation, failure to communicate with a client, and failure to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions.In November 2000, a client hired Ms. Schwartz to represent her in a tort matter that had arisen in October or November 1999 when a pitbull terrier escaped from its ownerâ€™s yard, ran into the clientâ€™s yard, and attacked and injured the clientâ€™s dog. While trying to separate the dogs, the client fell and sustained physical injury. The attack occurred within the city limits of Almira, Washington, where a city ordinance prohibited pitbull terriers within the city limits. The client wished to file an action against the dogâ€™s owner and to pursue an action against the city of Almira for failure to enforce the ordinance. The statute of limitations for the clientâ€™s tort claim against the city expired three years from the date of her injury (October or November 2002). In January 2000, the client filed a â€œcitizen complaintâ€ with the city of Almira regarding the pitbull attack. Ms. Schwartz agreed to represent the client and bring an action against the city of Almira, its insurance carrier, and the pitbullâ€™s owner. The client informed Ms. Schwartz that she specifically wanted the matter filed in Spokane County because she felt that she would not receive a fair hearing in Lincoln County. Ms. Schwartz never informed the client that, owing to jurisdictional issues, the matter could not be filed in Spokane County. In October 2001, Ms. Schwartz filed a lawsuit against the pitbullâ€™s owner and the City of Almira in Lincoln County. Ms. Schwartz met with the client twice to discuss the case, but subsequently did nothing more on the matter. The client attempted to contact Ms. Schwartz several times without success. In early 2002, the client discussed the case with another lawyer. The lawyer informed Ms. Schwartz that the claim was probably deficient and that Ms. Schwartz should dismiss the lawsuit and refile it in an adjoining county in the proper form. The lawyer also recommended that Ms. Schwartz obtain the clientâ€™s medical records and communicate more with the client. Ms. Schwartz assured the lawyer that she planned to refile the matter in Spokane County and that she would contact the client and obtain the medical records promptly. In September 2002, the lawyer contacted Ms. Schwartz and found she had still not done anything on the clientâ€™s matter. After referring Ms. Schwartz to the appropriate court rule, the lawyer told Ms. Schwartz that she still thought there was time to take a voluntary nonsuit and refile the claim. She also told Ms. Schwartz that if she wanted to terminate representation, she should file the claim first to protect the clientâ€™s rights. In November 2002, Ms. Schwartz dismissed the Lincoln County action with the intent of refiling it in Spokane County, but she never refiled the lawsuit.Ms. Schwartzâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation; RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s directives concerning the objectives of representation; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; and RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client.Sachia Stonefeld Powell represented the Bar Association.

844.html,16421,Douglas Robertson,,Reprimand,12/13/2006,,"Douglas K. Robertson (WSBA No. 16421, admitted 1986), of Bellingham, was ordered to receive a reprimand on December 13, 2006, following a stipulation approved by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2001 and 2003 involving conflicts of interest and failure to withdraw from representation after a conflict of interest became apparent.In early 2000, Mr. Robertson began representing a real estate developer. A year earlier, another partner in Mr. Robertsonâ€™s firm had been hired to represent a lender/investor in a real estate development matter in which Mr. Robertsonâ€™s client was the developer. Conflict waiver letters were signed by the lawyers and clients providing that if a dispute arose, Mr. Robertson would withdraw from representing the developer while his partner would continue to represent the lender/investor client. During the fall of 2001, disputes arose between the two parties over a particular real estate development project. At a meeting in November 2001, the clients were informed that an actual conflict existed, that the lender/investor client had the right to request that Mr. Robertson cease representing the developer, and that both parties could consult independent counsel. The lender/investor client consented to Mr. Robertsonâ€™s continued representation of the developer.Between November 2001 and April 2002, each side sought to negotiate a settlement of the dispute and a draft agreement was prepared by Mr. Robertson. The draft settlement agreement included written disclosure of and waiver of any conflict of interest. In February 2002, a specific disagreement arose between the parties regarding the disbursement of proceeds from the sale of property in the development project, which the parties endeavored to resolve by oral agreement. In March 2002, Mr. Robertson wrote a letter to his law partner asserting that the lender/investors had reneged on an agreement about use of sale proceeds and stating that because the â€œsituation created an actual conflict,â€ an independent lawyer would be advising his client as to the relationship between the parties. Soon after that date (in March 2002), another lawyer took over representation of the developer regarding the settlement agreement. Thereafter, Mr. Robertson was not involved with the negotiation or representation of the developer regarding the settlement agreement. In early April, another lawyer acting as co-counsel for the lender/investor requested that Mr. Robertson withdraw from representing the developer on any projects involving the lender/investor. Mr. Robertson refused to completely withdraw, but subsequently withdrew from representing the developer on some matters related to the lender/investor.In mid-April, the two parties signed a settlement agreement. Though based on the earlier drafts prepared by Mr. Robertson, the final document was negotiated and modified by independent counsel or co-counsel for both parties. The April settlement agreement did not contain conflict consent language. The lender/investor was then asked to sign a new conflicts waiver regarding the involvement of Mr. Robertson, but refused to do so. Mr. Robertson continued to represent the client on certain projects involving the lender/investor through mid-2003.Mr. Robertsonâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.7(a), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client will be directly adverse to another client, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the relationship with the other client and each client consents in writing after consultation and full disclosure of the material facts; RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after a full disclosure of material facts; RPC 1.10(a), prohibiting lawyers associated in a firm from knowingly representing a client when any of the lawyers in the firm would be prohibited from the representation if practicing alone; and former RPC 1.15(a)(1), requiring a lawyer to withdraw from a representation if the representation will result in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.Nancy Bickford Miller represented the Bar Association.

847.html,1482,Kenyon Kellogg,,Reprimand,6/28/2005,,"Kenyon P. Kellogg Jr. (WSBA No. 1482, admitted 1971), of Bainbridge Island, was ordered to receive two reprimands on June 28, 2005, following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2001 and 2004 involving failure to adequately communicate the factors involved in determining the charges for legal services at the outset of the representation, attempting to charge an unreasonable fee, and failure to surrender papers belonging to the client upon termination of the representation.In 2001, Mr. Kellogg was hired by a client to represent him in the anticipated sale of his company. Before being hired, Mr. Kellogg told the client that he could do the work on an hourly basis at a rate of $200 per hour. Mr. Kellogg did not prepare a written fee agreement for his work on the sale of the clientâ€™s company. Mr. Kellogg had previously performed work for this client but had never employed a written fee agreement for that work, basing fees on time spent times an hourly rate. For prior legal work, Mr. Kellogg had occasionally reduced the amount of the original billing, but had never increased a bill over the hourly charges. In October 2001, Mr. Kelloggâ€™s invoice to the client totaled $10,160, charged at the $200 per hour rate, which the client promptly paid in full. Mr. Kellogg then told the client that the hourly rate would increase to $300 per hour, to which the client agreed. In November and December 2001, invoices sent to the client totaled $6,420 and $26,970 respectively, charged at $300 per hour. The client promptly paid each invoice in full. A buyer made a nearly full-price offer for the company, and the sale closed in December 2001. Mr. Kellogg worked long hours in connection with the matter, frequently at night. Mr. Kellogg served as the escrow agent, which required that he hold the purchaserâ€™s and sellerâ€™s respective documents until he received confirmation that the wire transfer had been accomplished. On December 31, the clientâ€™s comptroller e-mailed Mr. Kellogg seeking an estimate of Mr. Kelloggâ€™s December fees by January 4 in order to complete the clientâ€™s 2001 accounting. Mr. Kellogg responded that the sales price achieved included what he termed â€œa pot of â€˜found moneyâ€™â€¦classic â€˜value addedâ€™ out of which hopefully to be paid a fair fee,â€ and that â€œtrying to figure out what is â€˜fairâ€™ in such circumstances is a unique experience, and may take a bit longer than January 4th.â€Mr. Kelloggâ€™s next invoice, dated March 25, 2002, covered December 1, 2001, through February 22, 2002. It totaled $89,730, computed at a $300 per hour rate, and contained a blank following the line â€œPlus a fair feeâ€ for what Mr. Kellogg characterized as the â€œvalue added.â€ The client added $10,270 to the hourly charges of $89,730 for a total of $100,000. In an April 2002 letter transmitting â€œpayment in full,â€ the client explained why he thought the $100,000 was a fair amount and requested copies of his documents. Mr. Kellogg cashed the check. In May 2002, Mr. Kellogg wrote to his client that he was â€œvery angryâ€ and â€œyour apparent concept of fairness and mine are hundreds of thousands of dollars apart.â€ Mr. Kellogg promised to â€œfinish my invoiceâ€ and asked for final exhibit documents and for reconciliation to the final price â€œso that I can finish binding your agreement materials.â€In August, Mr. Kellogg reissued his last invoice and filled in the blank following â€œPlus a fair feeâ€ with $700,000. He noted that $100,000 had been paid and the balance due was $689,730. In September 2002, the client expressed sorrow â€œthat our relationship must apparently end on this noteâ€ and requested that all documents pertaining to his company and to himself be sent to him by September 15. The client offered to pay delivery costs. Nothing was delivered by the September 15 deadline. The client renewed his request for the documents in letters sent in October and December 2002. Mr. Kellogg did not respond until February 2003 in an e-mail to his client referencing â€œtwo, probably unrelated, pieces of â€˜unfinished businessâ€™: I need to finish and redeliver our closing documents,â€ and â€œYou owe me nearly $700K.â€ The client responded by indicating he would file a complaint with the Bar Association if he did not receive the requested documents by April. Mr. Kellogg did not comply with the deadline, and in May, he e-mailed the client suggesting a meeting in June. Mr. Kellogg added that â€œhe would be happy to interplead or otherwise escrow whatever you believe is properly yours pending a thoughtful final decision on the differences between us.â€ In June 2003, the client filed a grievance with the Bar Association. In October 2003, the client wrote to Mr. Kellogg, noting the â€œformal termination of our professional relationship,â€ and again requested the documents. In January 2004, Mr. Kellogg delivered the documents to his clientâ€™s former comptroller.Mr. Kelloggâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), requiring that a lawyerâ€™s fee be reasonable; RPC 1.5(b), requiring that when the lawyer has not regularly represented the client, or if the fee agreement is substantially different than that previously used by the parties, the basis or rate of the fee or factors involved in determining the charges for legal services and the lawyerâ€™s billing practices shall be communicated to the client, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation; RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to protect clientsâ€™ interests when withdrawing from representation, such as, inter alia, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled; and RPC 8.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct.Linda B.

The discipline is based upon his failure to avoid conflicts of interest, and submitting a declaration using a clientâ€™s secrets to her disadvantage in 1999.In 1999, Mr. Morales represented a husband in a criminal proceeding alleging that the client assaulted his wife.

He did not notify his clients, opposing counsel, or the courts of his suspension. In September 2004, Mr. Williams abandoned his law practice without making any arrangements for a lawyer to take over his active cases, which resulted in the following misconduct:Matter 1: In June 2004, a client hired Mr. Williams to defend him against possession of marijuana charges. The client paid to Mr. Williams $1,500. At arraignment on June 14, the court set a pretrial hearing for July 2004. Neither the client nor Mr. Williams appeared at the hearing.

Mr. Williams did not return the client's file to him, do any further legal work, or refund any unearned fees.Matter 2: In April 2004, Mr. Williams was hired by a client to assist her in a marriage dissolution proceeding. The client paid Mr. Williams $500 and gave him all of her original documents, including insurance papers, retirement papers, and an original stock certificate. The client did not keep copies of her documents. Mr. Williams reassured the client that he would send copies of the documents to her, which he did not do. Mr. Williams filed a notice of appearance and response to the petition on April 9. A status conference was held on May 27, and the next day, the court entered a case schedule with a November 2004 trial date. Mr. Williams took no further action in the case, did not respond to the client's many attempts to contact him, and did not arrange for substitution of counsel.Matter 3: In January 2004, a client hired Mr. Williams to obtain an order for post-secondary education child support while the client's daughter (then 16 years old) attended college. Mr. Williams encouraged the client to seek increased child support for both her daughters. The client paid Mr. Williams $1,000. In February 2004, Mr. Williams filed a motion and order for show cause, which was opposed. The hearing was continued until May, at which time Mr. Williams filed a summons and petition for modification of support, which was opposed.

The client gave Mr. Williams some original documents. At the time, Mr. Williams was an associate at a law firm. In October 2003, Mr. Williams left the law firm to form his own firm and took the client's file with him. Between August 2003 and June 2004, the client made installment payments on Mr. Williams's flat fee of $2,000. After June 2004, Mr. Williams did not respond to any of the client's telephone calls, e-mails, or correspondence. The client was unable to obtain any of his original documents or his client file from Mr. Williams.

Parry (WSBA No. 15203, admitted 1985), of Seattle, was suspended for one year, effective April 5, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct in several matters involving lack of diligence, failure to communicate with clients, conflict of interest, trust-account irregularities, fee improprieties, failure to supervise a nonlawyer employee, and use of a false firm name.Between 2001 and 2005, Mr. Parry engaged in the following conduct that established grounds for discipline:â€¢ For eight months, representing on all of his pleading paper, letterhead, business cards, and e-mail communications that he was practicing as a member of a law firm when no such firm existed.â€¢ In two personal-injury matters, collecting fees on the same day settlement checks were deposited in the firmâ€™s trust account and before the settlement checks had cleared the banking system, thereby using funds of other clients until the settlement checks cleared the banking process.â€¢ Paying his firm a fee based on one-third of the gross recovery when the fee agreement provided for one-third of the net recovery and without reviewing the proposed fee disbursement with this client.â€¢ Drafting a fee agreement that did not clearly indicate the manner in which the contingent fee was to be calculated.â€¢ Withdrawing trust-account funds that he was not entitled to collect, and failing to return overpayments to the trust account when the overpayments were brought to his attention.â€¢ Failing to promptly pursue resolution of a clientâ€™s medical-provider claim in a personal-injury matter.â€¢ In two personal-injury matters, using fee agreements giving him a power of attorney to execute settlement checks and releases on behalf of the clients without first obtaining the clientsâ€™ consent in writing after full disclosure.â€¢ Failing to return to the trust account funds collected for cost reimbursement when the client disputed entitlement to those funds.â€¢ Failing to advise a client whether the claims he was pursuing were the property of the clientâ€™s bankruptcy estate.â€¢ Failing to supervise his clerk so that the medical records necessary to pursue a clientâ€™s claim were obtained in a timely matter.Mr. Parryâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable; RPC 1.5(b), requiring a lawyer, when the lawyer has not regularly represented the client, or if the fee agreement is substantially different than that previously used by the parties, to communicate the rate of the fee or factors involved in determining the charges for legal services, preferably in writing; former RPC 1.5(c)(1), requiring a contingent-fee agreement to be in writing and state the method by which the fee is to be determined; former RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after consultation and a full disclosure of the material facts; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of a client paid to a lawyer be deposited into an identifiable interest-bearing trust account and that no funds belonging to the lawyer be deposited therein; RPC 5.3, requiring a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over a nonlawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the personâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; former RPC 7.1(a), prohibiting a lawyer from making a false or misleading communication about the lawyer or the lawyerâ€™s services, including a communication that contains a material misrepresentation of fact; RPC 7.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from using a firm name, letterhead, or other professional designation that violates RPC 7.1(a); and RPC 7.5(d), providing that lawyers may state or imply that they practice in a partnership or other organization only when that is the fact.Randy V.

Graham (WSBA No. 15290, admitted 1985), of Renton, was disbarred, effective October 5, 2006, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct between 2000 and 2005 involving commission of criminal acts with intent to defraud a client, dishonesty, failure to keep a client reasonably informed, lack of competence, lack of diligence, failure to expedite litigation, failure to maintain appropriate records of client funds, and failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation.From 1995 until early 2005, Mr. Graham lived in a furnished apartment in Renton. Mr. Graham paid no rent during the time he lived there, instead performing legal work for the building owner (â€œclientâ€) and her family. Under their arrangement, Mr. Graham did not charge the client any legal fees, but would charge her for costs incurred in connection with litigation and other legal matters. Mr. Graham did not provide his client with actual bills, court receipts, or an accounting of how he spent the money she gave him for costs. He also did not maintain records of his receipts and disbursements. Between May 2000 and September 2004, Mr. Graham provided the client with eight forged documents, including falsified court orders, judgments, and other correspondence, thereby fraudulently inducing her to give him money for nonexistent legal costs.In November 2004, in a matter pending in superior court, the judge dismissed the case with prejudice because Mr. Graham had failed to comply with a discovery order and failed to respond to the adverse partyâ€™s third motion to dismiss. Mr. Graham never informed his client that her case had been dismissed.In February 2005, disciplinary counsel transmitted to Mr. Graham a copy of the clientâ€™s grievance and requested a response.

This discipline was based on his conduct between 2002 and 2004 involving a conflict of interest.In March-April 2002, Mr. Poole requested and obtained a personal loan from a private lender. At that time, Mr. Poole was representing a client in a litigation matter involving property on which the lender held a secured interest. Mr. Poole was in regular contact with the lender on his clientâ€™s behalf. In April, Mr. Poole executed a promissory note and deed of trust to secure a loan from the lender, which required him to make monthly interest payments and then a balloon payment that would pay the loan in full after one year. Mr. Poole, on his own behalf, subsequently proposed another business transaction with the lender related to property in Bothell that he wanted to develop. At that time, his clientâ€™s litigation matter involving the lender had not been completely resolved. Mr. Pooleâ€™s client was not involved in nor informed about the Bothell property proposal. The lender did not make a loan to Mr. Poole in connection with the Bothell property.Mr. Pooleâ€™s loan payments became past due. A representative of the lender wrote to Mr. Poole and left telephone messages, but received no answer. In September 2003, the lender filed for bankruptcy. During the time that Mr. Pooleâ€™s loan was outstanding, he continued to communicate and negotiate with the lender on his clientâ€™s behalf in regard to financing other projects and in an attempt to delay foreclosure of the lenderâ€™s security interests in his clientâ€™s properties. In October 2003, Mr. Poole communicated with the lender about its bankruptcy and its effect on the lenderâ€™s business relationship with his client. In April 2004, on his clientâ€™s behalf, Mr. Poole communicated with the lender regarding a loan secured by his clientâ€™s boat. At the time, Mr. Poole was delinquent on his own loan from the lender. Mr. Poole never disclosed to the client his independent business relationship with the lender or explained to the client the implications of this relationship, and he failed to obtain consent in writing from the client.Mr. Pooleâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after consultation and a full disclosure of the material facts.M.

Plowman (WSBA No. 21823, admitted 1992), of Bellevue, was suspended from the practice of law for three years, effective April 13, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2005 involving the commission of a criminal act.In 2005, one of Mr. Plowmanâ€™s clients, who has since been convicted of narcotics trafficking in federal court, became interested in acquiring a laundromat located in Seattle. The laundromatâ€™s negotiated price was in excess of $150,000. Mr. Plowman provided legal assistance to the client in purchasing the laundromat. Mr. Plowman received two cashierâ€™s checks from the client, which were in the names of third parties and totaled approximately $56,000. Mr. Plowman deposited these checks in his client trust account to be used in partial payment for the laundromat. Mr. Plowman then met with the client at a residence in Seattle and received from the client approximately $120,000 cash in paper bags to pay the balance for the laundromat. Mr. Plowman brought the money to his Bellevue law office and stored it in a safe. The currency was proceeds derived by the client from his participation in cocaine trafficking in Seattle. Mr. Plowman did not document his receipt of this currency in any way and willfully failed to file a â€œReport of Cash Payments Over $10,000 Received in a Trade or Businessâ€ with the Internal Revenue Service, as required by law, indicating the identity of the individual from whom the cash was received, the person on whose behalf the such transaction was conducted, and a description of the transaction and the method of payment. In June 2005, Mr. Plowman met with the seller of the laundromat and delivered a check drawn on his client trust account in the amount of approximately $60,000. Mr. Plowman also delivered approximately $100,000 of the cash received from his client to the seller to pay the balance due on the laundromat. The purchase and sales agreement reflected a total sales price of $60,000, whereas the true sales price was approximately $160,000. Of the remaining cash, some was used to pay laundromat expenses and some was taken by Mr. Plowman as his fee.In October 2006, Mr. Plowman pleaded guilty to the felony crime of failure to file a currency transaction report (Form 8300), in violation of 31 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a) and 5322(b).Mr. Plowmanâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.Francesca Dâ€™Angelo represented the Bar Association.

86.html,19443,Zachary Kinneman,,Disbarment,9/1/2000,,"Zachary A. Kinneman (WSBA No. 19443, admitted 1990), of Lakewood, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective September 1, 2000, approving a stipulation. The discipline is based on his practicing while suspended, abandoning his practice without notice to his clients, and removing client money from his trust account.Suspension: In 1998, Mr. Kinneman failed to file the required compliance report demonstrating compliance with the Continuing Legal Education (CLE) requirements for 1995 through 1997. On February 1, 1999, The Supreme Court suspended Mr. Kinnemanâ€™s license to practice law in Washington for failure to comply with the CLE requirements.On February 17, 1999, by certified mail, disciplinary counsel notified Mr. Kinneman of his duties upon suspension including the requirement that he file an affidavit of compliance within 25 days of the suspension. Mr. Kinneman does not recall receiving this notice. As of the date of the stipulation, Mr. Kinneman had not completed the required CLE credits or filed the affidavit of compliance regarding his suspension.At the time of his suspension, Mr. Kinneman was counsel of record for the plaintiffs in a lawsuit. Mr. Kinneman did not notify his clients, opposing counsel, or the court that his license had been suspended and that he could no longer represent them. On April 14, 1999, Mr. Kinneman signed a stipulation in the case allowing the defendants to amend their answer.Abandonment of Practice: In early 1999, Mr. Kinneman closed his law office without providing notice to his clients, opposing counsel or courts. He allowed his phone line to be disconnected with no forwarding information, and did not provide a forwarding address to clients or the Bar Association. At this time, Mr. Kinneman represented several clients who were affected by his actions.Matter 1: In September 1996, Mr. Kinneman agreed to represent clients in a dispute with the personal representative (PR) of their auntâ€™s estate. The clients believed that the PR had sold a parcel of real property at below-market value. Mr. Kinneman assisted the clients in removing the PR and obtaining a $20,000 distribution of estate assets.On September 30, 1998, Mr. Kinneman told the clients that the case was set for trial on February 15, 1999, and that he believed they could recover the entire value of the property. The clients were not able to contact Mr. Kinneman after this date.Matter 2: In April 1998, Mr. Kinneman agreed to represent two condominium residents in a dispute with the management company. The clients believed that the management company employees had made defamatory statements about them. The clients paid a $1,000 retainer, which Mr. Kinneman agreed would cover commencing a lawsuit. Mr. Kinneman drafted a declaration based on the clientsâ€™ letters, but took no further action. The clients were not able to contact Mr. Kinneman.Matter 3: In September 1997, Mr. Kinneman agreed to represent a client who was one of several defendants in a real property case. The plaintiffâ€™s case had settled, but there was a cross-claim pending against Mr. Kinnemanâ€™s clientOn June 12, 1998, the court entered a judgment against the client on the cross-claim. Mr. Kinneman agreed to appeal the judgment. A month later, the client had not heard from Mr. Kinneman and was unable to contact him. The clientâ€™s lawyer in another matter did contact Mr. Kinneman, and he told her that he had filed the appeal and would send copies of the documents. Mr. Kinneman did not file the appeal and the time period for filing expired. The judgment creditor aggressively pursued collecting the judgment, and the client was forced to file a petition for relief in bankruptcy.Matter 4: In August 1997, Mr. Kinneman agreed to represent a residential construction company in a suit to enforce a claim of lien against a property owner. The construction company had performed remodeling work for the homeowner and had not been paid. In August 1997, Mr. Kinneman filed the lien, and his client notified him that he had misspelled the lien holderâ€™s name. Mr. Kinneman stated that he had refiled the lien under the correct name and had served the lien by certified mail. On October 8, 1997, the last day to file the lien, the client contacted Mr. Kinneman to verify that the lien had been properly filed. Mr. Kinneman did not respond to the clientâ€™s inquiry. In November 1997, the client retained new counsel. Because Mr. Kinneman could not establish that the homeowners had received the lien, the client agreed to settle his claim for less than the value of the original lien.Matter 5: In June 1997, Mr. Kinneman agreed to act as closing and escrow agent in a mortgage refinance transaction. Mr. Kinneman properly disbursed the loan fee and proceeds, but failed to pay off three prior mortgage lenders or obtain reconveyances of the prior deeds of trust. Mr. Kinneman did not account for approximately $125,000 of the funds. He used approximately $30,000 of these funds to pay his personal debts. It appears that, contrary to the escrow instructions, Mr. Kinneman disbursed the remaining funds to an unrelated third party.Believing that the underlying mortgage had been paid off, the property owner stopped paying the monthly payments on the original loans. The prior mortgage lenders commenced trusteeâ€™s foreclosure proceedings on the properties involved. The property owner lost one property in nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings and stopped the remaining proceedings by filing for bankruptcy relief.Matter 6: Mr. Kinneman failed to cooperate with the Bar Associationâ€™s investigation of these matters. He did not respond to written requests for information pursuant to RLD 2.8 in several matters. He also failed to comply with a subpoena duces tecum issued by disciplinary counsel.Mr. Kinnemanâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud or misrepresentation; 1.15(a)(1), requiring lawyers to withdraw from matters if the representation will result in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPCs); 5.5(a), prohibiting lawyers from practicing in jurisdictions where doing so violates the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction; 8.4(d), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; 1.3, requiring lawyers to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing clients; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed of the status of their matters and to comply with reasonable requests for information; 1.5, requiring lawyers to charge reasonable fees for representation; 1.15(d), requiring lawyers to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests when withdrawing from representation; 1.14, requiring lawyers to preserve the identity of client funds or property in the lawyerâ€™s possession; RLDs 8.1(a), requiring suspended lawyers to notify their clients and others of their suspension; 8.2, requiring suspended lawyers to discontinue practicing; and 8.3, requiring suspended lawyers to file an affidavit indicating compliance with the duties upon suspension within 25 days of the suspension.Douglas Ende represented the Bar Association.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 2004 and 2005 involving the practice of law while suspended, failure to communicate with clients, misrepresentations to a third party, trust account irregularities, and noncooperation with a disciplinary investigation. On November 29, 2004, Mr. Ordinartsev was suspended from the practice of law for a period of two years by order of the Washington State Supreme Court. In two personal injury matters, Mr. Ordinartsev failed to notify the clients that he was suspended and unable to act as their lawyer. During the period of his suspension Mr. Ordinartsev continued communicating with insurance company representatives regarding his clientsâ€™ claims and negotiated settlements of both matters.In one of the matters, following receipt of the settlement check, Mr. Ordinartsev disbursed funds to himself and the client before the deposited check had cleared the banking system. Mr. Ordinartsevâ€™s accounting to the client reflected that he was disbursing funds to the clientâ€™s insurance company to discharge a subrogation interest. Mr. Ordinartsev repeatedly falsely represented to an insurance company representative that he had issued a check to discharge the subrogation interest. He instead used the funds to pay personal and/or business expenses.During the Bar Associationâ€™s investigation of an ensuing grievance, Mr. Ordinartsev failed to promptly respond to the grievance and testified falsely during a deposition taken during the investigation.Mr. Ordinartsevâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.15(a)(1), requiring a lawyer to withdraw from representation of a client if the representation will result in the violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law; RPC 4.1, prohibiting a lawyer, in the course of representing a client, from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; RPC 4.4, prohibiting a lawyer, in representing a client, from using means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person; RPC 5.5(a), prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction where doing so violates the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction; RPC 5.5(e), prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law while on inactive status, or while suspended from the practice of law for any cause; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, the unauthorized practice of law and theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; RPC 8.4(j), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order directing him or her to do or cease doing an act which he or she ought in good faith to do or forbear; RPC 8.4(k), prohibiting a lawyer from violating his or her oath as an attorney; RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (here, ELC 1.5, 5.3, 14.1(c), and 14.2) in connection with a disciplinary matter; and RPC 8.4(n), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law.Marsha A.

This discipline was based on his conduct in 2006 involving filing a false report with a law school committee.In January 2005, Mr. Jepson was admitted to practice law in the state of New Hampshire. Mr. Jepson worked full-time as a tenured professor of law at the Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord (Pierce Law). For the academic year 2005-2006, Mr. Jepson was appointed to serve on a faculty committee charged with assessing the performance and qualifications of another law professor in connection with that professorâ€™s application for tenure. As part of his committee responsibilities, Mr. Jepson was required to attend classes conducted by the professor and to submit a report of his observations to the committee chair. Mr. Jepson prepared and submitted a report describing two of the professorâ€™s classes in detail. The report was a fabrication. Mr. Jepson had not attended any of the professorâ€™s classes. In response to initial informal inquiries of other committee members, Mr. Jepson reiterated falsely that he had attended the professorâ€™s classes. Once it was established that the report was a fabrication, Mr. Jepson admitted his misconduct and apologized to the faculty. Mr. Jepsonâ€™s misconduct did not prejudice the professorâ€™s candidacy for tenure. Mr. Jepson resigned from the law school faculty.Mr. Jepsonâ€™s conduct violated New Hampshire RPC 8.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from violating the Rules of Professional Conduct; and New Hampshireâ€™s RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Joanne S.

866.html,15830,Bradley Marshall,,Suspension,5/10/2007,,"Bradley R. Marshall (WSBA No. 15830, admitted 1986), of Seattle, was suspended for 18 months, effective May 10, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. This discipline was based on his conduct between 1996 and 2000 involving conflicts of interest, failure to communicate with clients, failure to maintain complete records of client funds and to provide clients with an accounting, filing an appeal without client authority, charging excessive costs, and instructing a third party to create a deceptive invoice to conceal the nature of a fee arrangement. For additional information, see In re Discipline of Marshall, 160 Wn.2d 317, 157 P.3d 859 (2007).Commencing in 1996, Mr. Marshall represented a number of longshoreman clients in a federal district court action alleging racial discrimination against several local unions. During the course of and following the representation, Mr. Marshall engaged in the following conduct that established grounds for discipline:â€¢ Mr. Marshall did not explain to each of the clients the implications of, or the advantages and risks involved in, common representation, and he did not obtain written consent from the clients to multiple representation;â€¢ Mr. Marshall filed an appeal of the dismissal of one of the defendants without the knowledge or authorization of several of his clients, and following commencement of the appeal he did not provide the clients with a meaningful explanation of the facts of the appeal and its consequences for each of them;â€¢ Mr. Marshall instructed a nonlawyer who had initially referred the case to his office, and to whom the clients owed 10 percent of the final settlement proceeds as a consultantâ€™s fee, to create an hourly invoice in an attempt to conceal the appearance of fee-sharing [Note that because the nonlawyer had a pre-existing agreement with the clients to pay a 10 percent fee, the Supreme Court concluded that Mr. Marshall did not split a fee in violation of RPC 5.4(a)];â€¢ Mr. Marshall improperly charged contract attorney fees as costs in violation of the written fee agreement and treated a refund of a $41,000 cost advance as an expense chargeable to the client; andâ€¢ Mr. Marshall did not maintain complete records of the receipt and disbursal of settlement proceeds or provide an appropriate accounting to the client regarding the distribution of the funds.Mr. Marshall violated RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and to consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; former RPC 1.2(f), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully purporting to act as a lawyer for any person without the authority of that person; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable; RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after consultation and full disclosure of the material facts; former RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; former RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client the funds, securities, or other property in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Special Disciplinary Counsel Carolyn Cairns represented the Bar Association at the hearing.

Desper III (WSBA N. 18012, admitted 1988), of Seattle, was suspended for 60 days, effective June 7, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2004 involving an act of assault on another lawyer.In 2004, Mr. Desper was representing a criminal defendant charged with two felonies in superior court. During an omnibus hearing in June 2004, a disagreement arose between Mr. Desper and the prosecuting attorney about the terms of a potential plea agreement. There ensued a heated verbal exchange that became loud and escalated into a physical confrontation lasting about 10 seconds. The dispute concluded when Mr. Desper drew back his right arm, made a fist, and delivered a forceful blow to the prosecuting attorneyâ€™s chest. The prosecuting attorney stumbled backwards into the bailiff, who was standing with her back to the two men and who was thrown onto her computer. The bailiff then stepped between the two lawyers. Mr. Desper and the prosecuting attorney were escorted out of the courtroom.Mr. Desperâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any unjustified act of assault or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law, whether the same be committed in the course of his or her conduct as a lawyer, or otherwise, and whether the same constitutes a felony or misdemeanor or not.Debra Slater represented the Bar Association.

868.html,11123,Christopher Meleney,,Suspension,4/13/2007,,"Christopher C. Meleney (WSBA No. 11123, admitted 1980), of Everett, was suspended for six months, effective April 13, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on his conduct in 2004 involving failure to communicate with clients, taking action without client authority, conflict of interest, and filing a bankruptcy petition in violation of the federal bankruptcy rules.In July 2004, Mr. Meleney met with two principals of a company that operated a casino, restaurant, and inn (hereinafter â€œCompany Aâ€) and that was an operating subsidiary of an LLC. Company A was experiencing serious financial difficulties and a hearing concerning the revocation of its business license was scheduled to take place the following day.Mr. Meleney advised the principals that if Company A filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition, or if an involuntary petition was filed against it, the automatic bankruptcy stay would stop the license revocation hearing from taking place and give Company A the time it needed to obtain an infusion of funds. Mr. Meleney advised the principals that he would not represent Company A in filing a voluntary petition. Furthermore, it was unlikely that the consent of all of the owners could be obtained in time to stop the license revocation hearing. One of the principals agreed to make contact with Company Aâ€™s creditors regarding filing an involuntary petition.On the morning of the license revocation hearing, Mr. Meleney met with the two principals, and they decided to pursue the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy petition. One of the principals paid Mr. Meleney $2,500 as attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to file the involuntary petition. Representatives from three of Company Aâ€™s creditors telephoned Mr. Meleney. He did not adequately explain to these creditors that they would be the petitioning creditors initiating bankruptcy proceedings against Company A. In July 2004, Mr. Meleney filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against Company A on behalf of these three creditors. In the petition, and later in an amended petition, Mr. Meleney stated that he was attorney for the petitioning creditors. In September 2004, Mr. Meleney filed a motion for an order of default and default judgment against the debtor, Company A, for failure to file schedules. In the motion, Mr. Meleney again indicated that he was the attorney for the petitioning creditors. The companyâ€™s bankruptcy case was dismissed in October 2004 for failure to file schedules. Other than the telephone conversation that took place before the bankruptcy petition was filed, Mr. Meleney had no contact with the petitioning creditors until he sent them a letter in November 2004 advising them that the bankruptcy had been dismissed.In January 2005, in response to a United States trusteeâ€™s motion for sanctions, Mr. Meleney stipulated, in order to settle pending hearings, that he had violated Bankruptcy Rule 9011 by filing the bankruptcy petition. Rule 9011 provides that by presenting a petition to the court, an attorney certifies that to the best of his knowledge, formed after reasonable inquiry, the petition is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. Mr. Meleney also agreed to pay $2,161 to the State of Washington, to be distributed to former employees of Company A whose ability to collect owed wages was negatively impacted by the filing of the bankruptcy petition. Mr. Meleneyâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and to consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; RPC 1.2(d), prohibiting a lawyer from counseling a client to engage, or assisting a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent; former RPC 1.2(f), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully purporting to act as a lawyer for any person without the authority of that person; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.8(f), prohibiting a lawyer from accepting compensation for representing the client from one other than the client unless the client consents after consultation and there is no interference with the lawyerâ€™s independence of professional judgment or with the client-lawyer relationship, and information relating to the representation of a client is protected as required by RPC 1.6; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Debra Slater represented the Bar Association.

This discipline was based on her conduct in 2002 involving falsely testifying in a court proceeding. For more information see In re Discipline of Dornay, 160 Wn.2d 671, 161 P.3d 333 (2007).In 2001, Ms. Dornay began an extramarital affair with a King County Deputy Sheriff (hereinafter â€œDeputyâ€). When the affair began, Ms. Dornay, a partner with a law firm and a contract prosecutor for the city of Kenmore, was living with her husband and daughters. The Deputy was in the process of divorcing his wife. During the course of the affair, the couple took trips out of town together. During a trip in November 2001, the Deputy became enraged after an argument and slammed his head on a nightstand, cutting open his forehead. On another occasion, the Deputy put his service revolver in Ms. Dornayâ€™s hand and told her to pull the trigger because if she did not love him, he wanted to die. Ms. Dornayâ€™s relationship with the Deputy continued.In February 2002, Ms. Dornay testified under oath at the Deputyâ€™s divorce trial. She was called to testify regarding the child visitation exchanges she had witnessed between the Deputy and his wife. The Deputyâ€™s lawyer did not know about Ms. Dornayâ€™s ongoing affair with the Deputy. Ms. Dornay testified and answered a series of background questions about how well she knew the Deputy. While on the stand, Ms. Dornay was asked whether she had ever seen the Deputy â€œrageful at any timeâ€ or whether she had seen him â€œrant and raveâ€ or â€œberate.â€ Ms. Dornay answered no to these questions. In its opinion, the Supreme Court found that: â€œIf the judge had the benefit of Dornayâ€™s truthful testimony at the time she testified on [Deputyâ€™s] behalf, her testimony could have affected the judgeâ€™s decision regarding the parenting plan for [Deputyâ€™s] three-year-old child.â€In March 2002, Ms. Dornay broke off relations with the Deputy. Soon after, she informed members of her family about the affair. At this time, she confessed that she was not truthful when she testified in court that she had never seen the Deputy in a rage. In May 2002, Ms. Dornay petitioned for an order of protection against the Deputy, alleging he was abusive and threatening to her and her family. At the protection order hearing in June 2002, Ms. Dornay testified under oath that the Deputy had screamed at her, raged at her, and ranted and raved during the course of their relationship, including the time period prior to the February 2002 dissolution trial. After the hearing, Ms. Dornay signed a sworn declaration that she â€œmade the decision to perjureâ€ herself at trial in February 2002. This sworn declaration was filed by the Deputyâ€™s former wifeâ€™s lawyer in superior court in support of a petition to suspend the Deputyâ€™s visitation rights with his child. In 2003, during a deposition taken in the course of the Bar Associationâ€™s disciplinary investigation, Ms. Dornay testified under oath that her February 2002 trial testimony was false.In its opinion, the Supreme Court held â€œ[t]he Washington Legislature and the courts of this state have recognized the profound impact of intimate partner violence. While the nature of Dornayâ€™s relationship with [Deputy] does not excuse Dornayâ€™s actions, it is a mitigating factor that merits substantial weight.â€Ms. Dornayâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Kevin M.

This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to take any action in a client matter, lack of communication, trust account irregularities, failure to return client funds when requested to do so by the client, and failure to file a trust account declaration.In January 2003, Mr. Stilwill was hired by a client to research and prepare for him, if possible, an expungement of a criminal conviction. Mr. Stilwill received $750 by check for his fee, which he did not deposit into his trust account. On several occasions in the winter of 2003, the client asked Mr. Stilwill about the status of the matter. Mr. Stilwill started the research and compiled information, but did not communicate the results of his efforts to the client and completed no work that benefited the client. In March, Mr. Stilwill closed his law practice and began to work as a court commissioner. When closing down his office, Mr. Stilwill did not inform his client that he would no longer be able to represent him. The client continued to call Mr. Stilwill to find out the status of his case. The client never heard back from Mr. Stilwill and, eventually, the telephone number for Mr. Stilwill's office was disconnected. In approximately May 2004, the client sent a letter to Mr. Stilwill by certified mail asking for an accounting or a refund. Mr. Stilwill subsequently telephoned the client and told him he was leaving town and would check his files when he returned and refund his fee to him. Mr. Stilwill did not provide an accounting or refund to the client. The client wrote to Mr. Stilwill again in April 2005, with no response. The client filed a grievance with the Bar Association in May.When Mr. Stilwill closed his trust account in August 2005, he had no trust account records to document the ownership of the balance he removed from his trust account. In a letter to the Bar Association, Mr. Stilwill stated that ""[w]ith the exception of $37.00 (which was part of the initial deposit to open the account), I cannot inform you as to the source of the funds in the accountâ€¦. However, I am confident that I was the owner of the balance of the money and had not billed for it yet."" The $699.95 that Mr. Stilwill removed from his trust account in August 2005 had been in the trust account since at least January 2002. From approximately April 2003, when he closed his practice, until August 2005, when he closed his trust account, Mr. Stilwill did not maintain complete trust account records and did not reconcile his trust account ledger cards to his trust account statement. The Bar Association had been unable to identify the ownership of the funds in Mr. Stilwill's trust account at the time he closed it. No clients complained about missing funds or funds Mr. Stilwill should have been holding in their behalf.Former Rule 13.5(a) of the Rules for Lawyer Discipline (RLD) required each active lawyer to complete, execute, and deliver to the Bar Association a trust account declaration annually. In 2002, the deadline for filing the trust account declaration was February 1, 2002. Mr. Stilwill did not file a trust account declaration in 2002. The Bar Association sent him letters in May and June reminding him of his obligation to file the declaration, regardless of whether he had a trust account. Mr. Stilwill did not respond to these letters.Mr. Stilwill's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein; former RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client promptly upon receipt; former RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by a client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive; and former RLD 13.5(a), requiring a lawyer to file a trust account declaration with the Bar Association.

876.html,20603,John Walsh,,Suspension,7/18/2007,,"John A. Walsh (WSBA No. 20603, admitted 1991), of Bellevue, was suspended for eight months, effective July 18, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation by the Disciplinary Board. This discipline was based on conduct involving lack of communication, charging unreasonable fees, and conflicts of interest. John A. Walsh is to be distinguished from John P. Walsh of Seattle.Matter 1. In August 2004, Mr. Walsh was hired to represent a client who had been booked into jail on suspicion of violating a no-contact order. The clientâ€™s father gave Mr. Walsh his credit card number, to which Mr. Walsh charged his $5,000 fee. Mr. Walsh did not tell the clientâ€™s father that the fee was non-refundable or that there would be additional fees should the case go to trial. Mr. Walsh never attempted to communicate with the client about his fee or billing practices. When Mr. Walsh learned that no charges had been filed and that the client would be released from jail, Mr. Walsh met with the clientâ€™s father at the courthouse and had him sign a written fee agreement providing that the $5,000 paid was a â€œretainerâ€ and â€œnon-refundable fee earned upon receipt.â€ In the course of the representation, Mr. Walsh answered phone calls from the clientâ€™s family, but never met with the client and spoke with him only once, which was by telephone. During that one phone call, the client requested that Mr. Walsh assist him in getting the no-contact order with his wife lifted. Mr. Walsh advised the client to stay away from his wife, but made no attempt to get the order lifted. No further work was done on the case. Mr. Walsh refused to refund any part of the $5,000 fee.Matter 2. In July 2004, a client hired Mr. Walsh to represent her following an altercation with her husband on a U.S. military base. Mr. Walsh told the client that he would represent her for $2,000. In October 2004, the client was charged in U.S. District Court with a misdemeanor assault for scratching her husband. By the time the charge was filed, the clientâ€™s husband had been deployed to Iraq. In a written statement he made before his deployment, the clientâ€™s husband stated that the scratches he incurred were â€œpurely accidental.â€ The morning of the clientâ€™s arraignment in December 2004, Mr. Walsh provided her with a written fee agreement indicating that the $2,000 he had already received was a â€œnon-refundable fee earned upon receipt.â€ The terms of the fee agreement, which had not been communicated to the client prior to that day, also indicated that additional fees would be necessary should the case go to trial. The client signed the agreement before going into the courtroom. Mr. Walsh advised the client of her options. He did not include dismissal as an option. When she informed him that she wished to get the matter resolved quickly, Mr. Walsh did not explain to her the governmentâ€™s speedy trial limitation or the evidentiary problems that existed in the case. The client pleaded guilty at arraignment rather than setting the case for trial. The court appointed the federal public defender to represent the client in post-conviction proceedings, and she filed a stipulated motion with the assistant United States attorney to vacate the judgment and dismiss the charges.Matter 3. In August 2005, an individual charged with a Hit and Run Unattended hired Mr. Walsh to represent him. The clientâ€™s mother delivered to Mr. Walsh a check from her son for $900 to cover the representation. Just before leaving his office, Mr. Walsh had the clientâ€™s mother sign a fee agreement that provided for a $4,000 â€œnon-refundable fee earned upon receiptâ€ on a line above the words â€œThird Party/Guarantor.â€ In September 2005, while in court with Mr. Walshâ€™s associate, the client signed the fee agreement on a line above the word â€œclient.â€ Neither the client nor his mother was given a copy of the fee agreement. Mr. Walsh never consulted with the client about obligating the clientâ€™s mother to pay his legal fee, and the client never agreed to such an arrangement. In November 2005, Mr. Walsh telephoned the clientâ€™s mother several times to demand that she pay her sonâ€™s legal fee and threatened to sue her if she did not. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Walsh signed a complaint form alleging Breach of Contract against the clientâ€™s mother and caused the complaint to be served on her, although the complaint was never filed.Mr. Walshâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), requiring that a lawyerâ€™s fee be reasonable; RPC 1.5(b), requiring that when a lawyer has not regularly represented a client, or if the fee agreement is substantially different than that previously used by the parties, the basis or rate of the fee or factors involved in determining the charges for legal services and the lawyerâ€™s billing practices shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation; RPC 1.8 (f)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from accepting compensation for representing a client from one other than the client unless (1) the client consents after consultation; (2) there is no interference with the lawyerâ€™s independence of professional judgment or with the client-lawyer relationship; and (3) information relating to the representation of the client is protected as required by the rules.Robert B.

Grashin (WSBA No. 19609, admitted 1990), of Seattle, has been suspended for 12 months by order of the Supreme Court effective March 4, 2002, following a hearing. This discipline is based on his failure to avoid conflicts of interest in 1997.In early September 1997, Mr. Grashin agreed to meet a client to make some minor changes to his existing will. The original will left one-third of the clientâ€™s estate to the following three organizations: United Services Organization, Jewish Welfare Board and Mason Relief Organization Grand Lodge of Washington State. The client, who intended that the new will leave $10,000 per year to each of two children, died September 12.The new will that Mr. Grashin had drafted included large gifts to a school and a synagogue that had not been included in the original will. Mr. Grashinâ€™s children attended the school, his family attended the synagogue, and he had served on both boards. The new will also left one-time gifts of $10,000 each to the two children mentioned in the first will. The hearing officer found that Mr. Grashin intentionally failed to draft the will in accordance with the clientâ€™s stated intentions, did not explain his personal interests in these institutions to the client, and did not read the names and amounts of these bequests to the client during the will-signing.Mr. Grashinâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.2 and 8.4(c) by failing to abide by the clientâ€™s decisions concerning the representation; and 1.7(b), prohibiting lawyers from accepting representation of a client if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the client consents in writing after a full disclosure.Becky Neal represented the Bar Association.

885.html,18311,David Hellenthal,,Suspension,9/6/2007,,"David R. Hellenthal (WSBA No. 18311, admitted 1988), of Spokane, was suspended for 18 months, effective September 6, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation by the Disciplinary Board. Upon meeting conditions for reinstatement, the suspension is to be followed by a three-year period of probation. This discipline was based on conduct in three matters involving failure to abide by a client's objectives for representation; lack of communication; charging unreasonable fees; conflicts of interest; prohibited transactions; improper conduct with a disabled client; and conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Matter 1: In October 2004, Mr. Hellenthal was hired by a client with a disability who was concerned about the potential effect of a recent inheritance on his continued eligibility for government benefits. Mr. Hellenthal deposited the client's inheritance proceeds into his trust account. Between November 2004 and January 2005, Mr. Hellenthal transferred a total of $33,000 out of trust as legal fees. Mr. Hellenthal prepared a trust instrument by which he would inherit the client's trust assets if the client died without a will. Mr. Hellenthal knew the client did not have a will and did not consult with the client about any conflicts of interest. The trust prepared by Mr. Hellenthal did not comply with the Medicaid regulations for a qualified special needs trust, and could have subjected the client to several years of ineligibility for Medicaid benefits as a penalty or been rejected by the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS). The client did not understand the trust nor its potential negative ramifications and risks for him. In January 2005, the client hired a new lawyer who removed Mr. Hellenthal as trustee, hired a professional trustee, drafted a will for the client, and sought court approval for the trust. The client's new lawyer requested that Mr. Hellenthal reduce the $33,000 in attorney's fees. Mr. Hellenthal refunded a portion of the fees, retaining $7,130.87 for his services. Other Spokane-area lawyers charge $1,000 to $3,500 for the creation of a special needs trust.Matter 2: In March 2004, Mr. Hellenthal was hired to assist a married couple in qualifying the husband for Medicaid. The couple had been in a serious automobile accident in July 2003, which left the husband with a traumatic brain injury and physical impairments. Mr. Hellenthal did not meet with either client and never spoke to the husband. Mr. Hellenthal advised that the husband and wife should legally separate before applying for Medicaid. The wife agreed to have Mr. Hellenthal represent both herself and her husband. Mr. Hellenthal was aware of the client husband's extreme disabilities due to the accident. All communication with the clients was by telephone with either the wife or the wife's mother, who ran an adult-care home in which the husband resided. Mr. Hellenthal did not consult with the couple about any potential conflicts of interest, or the implications of common representation, and did not obtain any written conflict waivers. He prepared and filed for the couple legal documents that awarded the wife all of her husband's assets and all rights for any claims of damages from third parties as a result of the accident. The legal documents included a durable power of attorney which made the wife and her mother the attorneys-in-fact for the husband. Mr. Hellenthal did not inform the court in the pleadings of the husband's mental status. In June 2004, Mr. Hellenthal disbursed to the wife approximately $78,000 of funds obtained in recovery with respect to the couple's automobile accident. Meanwhile, marital difficulties arose between the husband and wife. The children of the husband subsequently retrieved him from the adult-care home and took him to see a new lawyer, who revoked the durable power of attorney. The husband eventually hired another lawyer to set aside the legal separation, recoup the husband's money, and begin dissolution proceedings. Matter 3: Mr. Hellenthal provided estate-planning services for a couple in 1994 and again in 2002. Among other things, he prepared a power of attorney making the wife the attorney-in-fact for her husband. In 2003, the husband suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. Mr. Hellenthal never spoke to the husband after his stroke. Mr. Hellenthal was informed that they were considering a nursing home for the husband. He suggested to the wife that the couple obtain a legal separation to qualify for Medicaid, even though the couple had substantial assets to pay for his care. The wife did not understand why Mr. Hellenthal wanted her to separate from her husband, but signed for her and her husband all the legal separation documents sent to her by Mr. Hellenthal. These documents awarded the wife all the couple's assets. In July 2003, the husband was found to be ""gravely disabled"" based on a diagnosis of longstanding dementia that had been worsened by the stroke, and was involuntarily transferred to a psychiatric ward. At about the same time the wife informed Mr. Hellenthal that her husband was in a psychiatric ward, she received a fee agreement stating that Mr. Hellenthal had ""explained to their satisfaction the advantages and disadvantages of common representationâ€¦."" Mr. Hellenthal had never explained the fee agreement to the wife and never told her there might be a conflict with his representing both her and her husband. Mr. Hellenthal filed the legal separation papers in Superior Court. The pleadings did not inform the court of the husband's mental status. Mr. Hellenthal had the wife sign quit claim deeds on various properties and began transferring assets into the wife's name. Approximately $1.6 million of assets were transferred, all while the husband was involuntarily detained in a psychiatric ward. The husband died shortly thereafter.Mr. Hellenthal's conduct violated RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation and consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyer's fee to be reasonable; RPC 1.7(a) and (b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client is directly adverse to another client, or materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client or to a third person, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the relationship with the other client and each client consents in writing after consultation and a full disclosure of the material facts; RPC 1.8(c), prohibiting a lawyer, in representing a client in a matter, from preparing an instrument giving the lawyer or a person related to the lawyer as parent, child, sibling, or spouse, any substantial gift from a client, including a testamentary gift, except where the client is related to the donee; former RPC 1.13, requiring a lawyer to determine whether a client's ability to make adequately considered decisions in connection with the representation is impaired because of minority, mental disability, or for some other reason; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.

Unbeknownst to him, the person with whom he had been communicating was an FBI agent, not a 14-year-old girl. In July 2004, Mr. Knowles was arrested in Portland at the location where the meeting had been arranged. Mr. Knowles was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2422(b) (Coercion and Enticement) and 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2423(b) (Interstate Travel with the Intent to Engage in Sex with a Minor), both of which are felonies. In August 2007, a jury found him guilty on both counts.Mr. Knowles closed his law practice in July 2004 after his arrest. Two of Mr. Knowlesâ€™s remaining clients at the time had hired him to represent them in employment matters. Mr. Knowles did not perform the specified services according to his fee agreement with each client and failed to refund unearned fees to these clients after his law firm closed. A third remaining client had hired Mr. Knowles to appeal a whistleblower complaint against his employer to the Merit Systems Protection Board. During the time Mr. Knowles represented this client, the client did not receive any billing statements or any indication of the time Mr. Knowles had spent on his case or how much of the fee had been expended.Mr. Knowlesâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyerâ€™s fee to be reasonable; former RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests upon termination of representation; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, coercion and enticement and interstate travel with the intent to engage in sex with a minor) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(i), which prohibits a lawyer from, inter alia, committing any act which reflects disregard for the rule of law, whether the same be committed in the course of his or her conduct as a lawyer.Joanne S.

889.html,3329,F. Taylor,,Reprimand,9/19/2007,,"F. Lawrence Taylor Jr. (WSBA No. 3329, admitted 1971), of Renton, received a reprimand on September 19, 2007, following approval of a stipulation by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on conduct involving unreasonable fees and improper use of attorney's liens.Mr. Taylor's practice consists mostly of plaintiff personal injury, and many of his clients are from Russia and the Ukraine. When clients hire him, Mr. Taylor has them execute a fee agreement written in English. If the client speaks little or no English, clients meet with one of Mr. Taylor's Russian-speaking or Ukrainian-speaking staff to ensure that they understand the agreement. Prior to March 2007, the fee agreement provided that in the event the client discharges the attorney or the attorney withdraws for cause, the client would agree to pay reasonable compensation for services rendered which would be calculated as ""not less than the time expended, or the agreed upon contingency percentage of the last offer received whichever is moreâ€¦. [C]lient understands that when attorney has been able to obtain the receipt of an offer, attorney has substantially performed the contingency herein."" Mr. Taylor asserts that he never enforced this provision in his fee agreement.In November 2004, Mr. Taylor terminated a bilingual paralegal. This paralegal later did contract work for a Bellevue law firm. Approximately 30 of Mr. Taylor's clients transferred their cases to the Bellevue firm. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Taylor sent some of these former clients a ""Bill for Services Rendered"" (bill). He included with the bill a ""Notice of Attorney Lien"" (notice), which indicated that a lien had already been recorded with the King County Recorder's Office by Mr. Taylor. Several of the bills included charges for preparing and sending out copies of the notice and, in one or more instances, the client whose real property could have been affected by the lien did not learn about Mr. Taylor's intention to file an attorney's lien until after he sent the client the notice. Mr. Taylor filed at least 20 such notices, ranging between $509.39 and $16,665.12, with the King County Recorder's Office. The notices were entered into the Recorder's Office public record. Mr. Taylor asserts that he filed the liens because there was no agreement to apportion fees between himself and the firm, who had assumed representation of the clients.In the fall of 2005, one of Mr. Taylor's former clients tried to refinance his home. The former client states that he was told by his mortgage broker that Mr. Taylor's lien would need to be satisfied from any loan proceeds received by the client in the refinance. The client asserts that because he disputed the amount claimed by Mr. Taylor, he was not willing to pay the lien and, as a result, he decided not to proceed with the refinance. The client maintains that he lost the opportunity to obtain a particularly favorable rate, and that it would cost him more to refinance now. Mr. Taylor subsequently released all his attorney's liens for the relevant clients and changed his fee agreement to remove the language regarding the contingency being substantially performed based on receipt of an offer by the opposing party. Mr. Taylor's conduct violated RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation and consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; RPC 1.5(a), requiring a lawyer's fee to be reasonable; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Kevin M.

This discipline is based on Mr. Byrdâ€™s direct contact with represented parties.Mr. Byrd represented a student and his parents regarding an individualized education program (IEP) for the student as required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.On August 24, 1999, the school districtâ€™s representative faxed Mr. Byrd a letter stating that RPC 4.2 prohibited him from making any direct contact with individuals in the school district regarding the case. Mr. Byrd immediately responded, stating that as the clientâ€™s agent, he had authority to communicate with some district personnel about educational issues.In September and October 1999, Mr. Byrd sent letters to district personnel asking that a meeting date be rescheduled, and questioning the qualifications of the members of a school district IEP review panel.On October 25, 1999, the school district representative sent a letter to Mr. Byrd objecting to his contacting the district regarding another student. Mr. Byrd responded that he had no intention of contacting the district representative for issues that were not directly in litigation at either an administrative or local court level.On January 21, 2000, Mr. Byrd sent his 10-day notice of intent to file due process litigation directly to the school district superintendent.Mr. Byrdâ€™s conduct violated RPC 4.2, prohibiting lawyers from communicating about the subject matter of the representation with persons the lawyer knows are represented by counsel, without consent of the other lawyer or legal authority to do so.Nancy Miller represented the Bar Association.

Doss (WSBA No. 25664, admitted 1996), of Portland, Oregon, was disbarred, effective October 4, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on conduct involving the practice of law while suspended. Effective August 3, 2005, Mr. Doss was suspended from the practice of law in Washington for failure to pay his license fee. In July 2005, Mr. Doss was sent a copy of the suspension order by certified mail along with a notice advising him that, inter alia, he must notify all clients of his suspension, he must serve an affidavit of compliance as required by the rules, he must cease to hold himself out as a lawyer until reinstated, and he must not practice law after the date of his suspension.At the time of his suspension, Mr. Doss had at least two active Washington clients whom he did not notify of his suspension. Mr. Doss never served an affidavit of compliance and continued to hold himself out as a lawyer licensed to practice in Washington. In November 2005, Mr. Doss signed and filed petitions for adoption, along with other related pleadings, in two Superior Court matters and noted both matters for December hearings. He delivered to the clerk two checks for filing fees, both of which were returned for insufficient funds. After the checks were returned for insufficient funds, the clerk learned that Mr. Doss was suspended and told him that he could not appear at the December hearings. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Doss wrote a letter to the WSBA that stated he ""would like to immediately resign from practice,"" and admitted that he had never served an affidavit of compliance, had not ceased holding himself out as a lawyer licensed to practice in Washington, had engaged in the practice of law after the date of his suspension, and had at least two active Washington clients whom he did not notify of his suspension.In December 2005, WSBA disciplinary counsel informed Mr. Doss that a grievance had been opened against him and requested a written response, along with copies of certain records, within three weeks. In January 2006, Mr. Doss requested a two-week extension, which he was granted. Mr. Doss has never provided a written response to the grievance and has never produced any of the records requested by disciplinary counsel.Mr. Doss's conduct violated former RPC 5.5(e), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in the practice of law while suspended from the practice of law for any cause; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, the unlawful practice of law) that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(j), prohibiting willfully disobeying or violating a court order directing him or her to do or cease doing an act which he or she ought in good faith to do or forbear; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Scott G.

This discipline resulted from conduct involving the filing of improper attorney liens.Between January 2004 and July 2005, to secure payment of attorney fees owed by clients in six different dissolution matters, Mr. Meader filed notices of attorneyâ€™s liens against the real property of clients, of clients and their spouses, and of third persons in violation of RCW 60.40.010.

This discipline was based on his conduct involving lack of diligence, lack of communication, failure to expedite litigation, charging an unreasonable amount for expenses, false statements, dishonesty, trust account irregularities, failure to take reasonably practicable steps to protect client interests upon termination of representation, and failure to cooperate with disciplinary investigations.

Jacobson (WSBA No. 26939, admitted 1997), of Redmond, was ordered to receive a reprimand on February 5, 2007, following approval of a stipulation by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on conduct in 2004 involving lack of diligence, failure to communicate, and failure to properly supervise a nonlawyer employee.Beginning in January 2004, Mr. Jacobson began representing a client in various matters, including a criminal case. The criminal matter came to trial in July, resulting in a hung jury. In October, after a second trial, the client was convicted of the criminal charges and sentenced to 400 months in prison. At some point prior to sentencing, Mr. Jacobson had a discussion with the client about how the client's assets and property should be handled in the event of his incarceration. Mr. Jacobson was instructed by the client to assist the client's girlfriend in removing and safeguarding the personal property located at a house they shared in Monroe. They also discussed liquidating some of the property. Mr. Jacobson did not clarify with the client who would be taking custody of the property or how the liquidation would be accomplished. The client maintains that he did not specifically authorize Mr. Jacobson to liquidate his property. At the time of the two trials in 2004, the client was separated from his wife and she had filed for dissolution proceedings. Mr. Jacobson began representing the client in the dissolution proceeding in October 2004. In the dissolution proceeding, the client's wife was claiming a share of the community assets, including items stored at the Monroe house. Mr. Jacobson sent his paralegal and some of her family members to assist the client's girlfriend in moving the client's personal property from the Monroe house to a storage facility. Mr. Jacobson paid his paralegal and her family members for providing these services. Mr. Jacobson did not provide his paralegal with any specific instructions to inventory, label, or otherwise account for the client's property. Neither Mr. Jacobson, nor his paralegal, nor anyone else from Mr. Jacobson's office ever prepared an inventory or any other accounting of the property that was removed from the Monroe house. Sometime in October, Mr. Jacobson, his paralegal, and the client's girlfriend visited the storage facility and Mr. Jacobson noticed there were some items not appropriate for storage. Following the visit, Mr. Jacobson advised his paralegal and the client's girlfriend that they should remove the items and store them ""someplace else."" Subsequently, without further instructions from Mr. Jacobson, his paralegal removed the items and took them to her residence. Mr. Jacobson was aware that his paralegal was storing some of the client's items at her residence, because he saw them there when he picked her up at her residence on one or more occasions.In October, without Mr. Jacobson's knowledge, his paralegal sold some of the client's property. She received a total of $440, which she retained. One of the items she sold, a Gibson-brand electric guitar, was worth considerably more than the $300 she received for it. In late October or November, Mr. Jacobson noticed that some of the property was missing and asked his paralegal about the missing items. She admitted she had sold them. Mr. Jacobson gave his paralegal funds to repurchase the items, but she was unable to purchase back the Gibson electric guitar.Sometime in October 2004, Mr. Jacobson took another of the client's guitars, from either the storage unit or from his paralegal's residence, intending to show it to his son's Boy Scout group. Mr. Jacobson kept the guitar in the trunk of his car for several weeks, but did not show it to the Boy Scout group. In November, Mr. Jacobson returned the guitar to his client's brother. In December, Mr. Jacobson terminated his paralegal's employment.Mr. Jacobson's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4(b), requiring a lawyer to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding representation; and RPC 5.3(b), requiring a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over a nonlawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the person's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer.Kevin M.

896.html,22141,Roger Ost,,Disbarment,12/7/2007,,"Roger D. Ost Jr. (WSBA No. 22141, admitted 1992), of Seattle, was disbarred, effective December 7, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court. This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to act with reasonable diligence; lack of communication; withholding client funds and property; failure to withdraw from representation; failure to expedite litigation; failure to comply with a discovery request; conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.In August 2002, a client hired Mr. Ost to represent her in her marriage dissolution. The client paid Mr. Ost an advanced attorneyâ€™s fee of $2,000 and provided him with documents supporting her claim that she invested money in her husbandâ€™s home. Mr. Ost agreed to represent the client in the dissolution and also suggested that he draft estate-planning documents for her. The documents that Mr. Ost drafted prematurely contained the clientâ€™s maiden name, which prevented her from getting them notarized.In September 2002, the client was served with a petition for dissolution of marriage. Although the client immediately gave the petition to Mr. Ost, he did not file a written notice of appearance until February 2003. Throughout 2002 and 2003, the client telephoned and mailed letters to Mr. Ost asking for information about her case. Mr. Ost did not return her telephone calls or answer her letters. The attorney representing the clientâ€™s husband filed a default motion, serving it on Mr. Ost on March 17, 2003. Mr. Ost filed an answer to the petition on March 27, 2003, but did not give a copy of the answer to his client or communicate with her about it. In April, the husbandâ€™s attorney served Mr. Ost with interrogatories, to which Mr. Ost did not respond or request an extension for a response. In June, Mr. Ost told the client that he had filed for and received a court date, which was false. The client discharged Mr. Ost and demanded an accounting of his time, a refund of any unearned fees, and the return of the documents she gave to him. Mr. Ost did not respond to the client and did not immediately withdraw from the representation.Through the efforts of the client and her husbandâ€™s lawyer, the decree dissolving the marriage was filed in August 2003. As a result of Mr. Ostâ€™s lack of action in the case, the client was unable to prove her total claim that she had invested money into her husbandâ€™s home and the husbandâ€™s legal fees were higher. Mr. Ost filed a notice of withdrawal in September 2003. The client filed a grievance against Mr. Ost in May 2003.In 2005, Mr. Ost misrepresented to Bar Association disciplinary counsel that he had paid restitution to the client, when in fact he had not paid restitution. He sent to disciplinary counsel a copy of a cashierâ€™s check as proof, which he later admitted to having altered in order to make it appear that he had paid restitution to the client. His failure to promptly pay restitution to the client caused the client serious injury.Mr. Ostâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; former RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by a client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive; former RPC 1.15(a)(3), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the lawyer is discharged; former RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; RPC 3.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer, in a pretrial procedure, from failing to make a reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing party; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.M.

897.html,17328,Robert Storwick,,Disbarment,12/6/2007,,"Robert M. Storwick (WSBA No. 17328, admitted 1987), of Mercer Island, was disbarred, effective December 6, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline resulted from conduct involving trust-account irregularities; commission of a criminal act; and conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.In late 2004 or early 2005, a client contacted Mr. Storwick regarding a European patent filing. The client had a provisional patent filing in the United States with a priority date of September 4, 2002. The client paid Mr. Storwick a $3,000 advance fee deposit as requested, which Mr. Storwick deposited into his client trust account. Mr. Storwick contacted a German lawyer about handling the European patent application for the client. Mr. Storwick told the client he would need an additional $4,325 to pay the German lawyer for services regarding the patent filing, which the client paid to Mr. Storwick in April. Mr. Storwick deposited the clientâ€™s check into his client trust account. Mr. Storwick paid none of the funds to the German lawyer, instead converting the $4,325 to his own use. In June 2005, the client received a letter from the German lawyer indicating that Mr. Storwick had not paid the fees and costs for the European patent application. The German lawyer had not been able to reach Mr. Storwick nor had any contact with him since early April. The client tried numerous times to contact Mr. Storwick by e-mail, telephone, fax, and mail without success. The client found that Mr. Storwickâ€™s office telephone and fax number had been disconnected. The client paid approximately $7,500 directly to the German lawyer in fees to pursue the European patent application and an additional â‚¬2,333.50 to the European patent office in penalties for late payment of patent fees. The client hired another U.S. patent attorney to revive his pending U.S. patent application, for which the client incurred $1,587 in fees and costs. Mr. Storwick did not respond to the clientâ€™s grievance or to attempts by the Bar Association to contact him. The Bar Association subpoenaed Mr. Storwickâ€™s bank records, which revealed that he had withdrawn most if not all of the clientâ€™s funds by May 2005. Bank records also revealed numerous telephone transfers between Mr. Storwickâ€™s personal or business accounts, including his IOLTA account, and that the majority of the funds in the IOLTA account had been transferred into his business and personal accounts. Mr. Storwick also issued checks from his client trust account to pay for his 2006 Bar Association dues and to the postmaster for post office box rental. Mr. Storwick deposited several checks designated as payment of invoices for earned client fees into his client trust account. Between January 2005 and June 2006, Mr. Storwickâ€™s business and personal accounts incurred approximately 20 NSF or overdraft charges.Mr. Storwickâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited into one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and no funds of the lawyer be deposited therein; former RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Nancy B.

898.html,27282,Dean White,,Reprimand,10/9/2007,,"Dean E. White (WSBA No. 27282, admitted 1997), of Spokane, was ordered to receive a reprimand on October 9, 2007, following approval of a stipulation by the hearing officer. This discipline was based on conduct in two matters involving failure to timely file bankruptcies, filing incomplete and inaccurate information, and failure to protect clientsâ€™ interests.Matter 1: In October 2004, Mr. White was hired to represent a client in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The client paid Mr. White a $350 flat fee and $210 for advance costs. In 2004, the client provided Mr. White with financial information, including client information worksheets. Mr. White delayed filing the bankruptcy for over six months. In May 2005, Mr. White filed the bankruptcy, but the petition, schedules, and other documents were incomplete and inaccurate. The petition did not include the clientâ€™s complete address. Mr. White was later informed that the client did not receive notices sent to him by the bankruptcy court because the court did not have a correct mailing address for the client. Mr. White never informed the court of the clientâ€™s correct mailing address, which was readily accessible from the materials he received. The 341 meeting of creditors was scheduled for June 2005. Mr. White did not inform the client about the meeting and, not having received notice from Mr. White or the court, the client did not appear at the meeting. The 341 meeting was rescheduled for August. Mr. White did not inform the client about the rescheduled meeting and, not having received notice from Mr. White or the court, the client did not appear at the August meeting. The trustee filed a motion to dismiss the clientâ€™s bankruptcy for failure to attend the 341 meeting. Mr. White did not respond to the motion and did not contact the client to inform him about the pending motion. The court entered an order dismissing the clientâ€™s bankruptcy. Mr. White did not attempt to inform his client about the dismissal and did not return the clientâ€™s phone messages. The client finally contacted Mr. White after he discovered his bankruptcy was dismissed and requested a refund. Mr. White did not refund any fees.Matter 2: In December 2004, Mr. White was hired to represent a client in her bankruptcy and received $350 in attorneyâ€™s fees from the client. The client provided Mr. White with sufficient information to file the bankruptcy at the time he was hired. Between May and July 2005, the client sent Mr. White 10 e-mails expressing concern that he had not yet filed her bankruptcy and complaining about a creditor who was garnishing her wages. Mr. White did not respond to her until July 28, 2005. The next day, Mr. White filed her bankruptcy petition and schedules. The petition did not include her signature, as required by the Bankruptcy Code, and the schedules did not include some of her debts. Between August and October 2005, Mr. White received several pleadings from the U.S. Trustee regarding information that was not included in the clientâ€™s petition and bankruptcy schedules, including a complaint commencing an adversary proceeding seeking to deny the clientâ€™s discharge. Mr. White did not timely respond to the pleadings. In mid-December 2005, the client called and left several messages asking to discuss the U.S. Trusteeâ€™s Notice to Deny Discharge. The client then sent an e-mail demanding Mr. White contact her no later than the next day. Mr. White eventually spoke to the client in late December and told her he would promptly file an amendment to her bankruptcy petition, but did not do so. The client terminated Mr. Whiteâ€™s services in January 2006 and filed the amended schedules herself, paying an additional $30 to amend the schedules. The U.S. Trusteeâ€™s adversary proceedings were dismissed and the client discharged her debts.Mr. Whiteâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; and RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client.Jonathan H.

899.html,1695,James Holcomb,,Suspension,12/20/2007,,"James B. Holcomb (WSBA No. 1695, admitted 1967), of Bainbridge Island, was suspended for six months, effective December 20, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. This discipline was based on conduct involving conflicts of interest.In 1998, Mr. Holcomb agreed to represent a client for an hourly fee to review files and make recommendations regarding an equal employment opportunity action that the client had filed pro se. Mr. Holcomb and the client later signed a second fee agreement in which Mr. Holcomb agreed to represent the client in an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) hearing. When the EEOC denied the clientâ€™s claim and the client decided to appeal to the U.S. District Court, the client and Mr. Holcomb agreed to a contingent fee arrangement and signed a third agreement. In 2003, after the District Court dismissed the clientâ€™s appeal, Mr. Holcomb and the client entered into a fourth fee agreement in which Mr. Holcomb agreed to file a notice of appeal at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and seek mediation of the clientâ€™s claim. Sometime in early March 2003, the client and Mr. Holcomb reached an impasse regarding the representation in the appeal, and Mr. Holcomb withdrew.From December 1999 through March 2001, Mr. Holcomb borrowed from the client a total of $52,300 in 24 individual loans. The amount of each individual loan ranged from $750 to $3,500. Most of the loans were outstanding for no more than two weeks; the last loan was outstanding for over a year. Mr. Holcomb eventually repaid all of the loans. The loans were not subject to a written loan agreement, payment of interest, penalties or fees, or a schedule for repayment of the principal. Mr. Holcomb did not provide security for the loans, did not advise the client that his personal interests might conflict with the clientâ€™s interests, did not obtain a written waiver of a conflict of interest, did not provide the client with information about his current financial condition, and did not advise the client that he could seek independent counsel about the suitability of his loan request. Eleven of the loans were made by cashierâ€™s check to Mr. Holcomb and contained references to the client; 13 of the loans were made by personal check from an account in the name of the client and his wifeâ€™s trust and were signed by either the client or his wife. Mr. Holcomb repaid the loans by personal checks made payable to the client.Mr. Holcombâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after consultation and a full disclosure of the material facts; and former RPC 1.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer from entering into a business transaction with a client unless the transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client in a manner which can be reasonably understood by the client, the client is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel in the transaction, and the client consents thereto.M.

901.html,4858,Fernando Perez-Pena,,Suspension,10/4/2007,,"Fernando Perez-Pena (WSBA No. 4858, admitted 1973), of Seattle, was suspended for 60 days, effective October 4, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. This discipline was based on conduct involving an unjustified act of assault and failure to return an unearned fee. For further information, see In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Perez-Pena, 161 Wash.2d 820, 168 P.3d 408 (2007).In March 2001, a married couple (clients) hired Mr. Perez-Pena to help them in an immigration matter. The clients agreed to a $2,000 fee, which they paid via check. There was no written fee agreement. Due to a number of concerns, the clients decided not to proceed with the matter and asked for a refund. Mr. Perez-Pena agreed to return $1,500, charging a flat fee of $500 for the work he had done, and gave the clients a check in that amount. However, they were unable to deposit the check because the bank account had only the client wifeâ€™s maiden name on it. Mr. Perez-Pena had possession of the clientsâ€™ marriage certificate, so they went back to his office to obtain the certificate. Their demeanor was hostile and, after obtaining the certificate, they threatened lawsuits and WSBA complaints. Based on the threats and what he perceived as a lack of appreciation for his agreement to refund the money, Mr. Perez-Pena stopped payment on the check. He did not notify the clients, and the check bounced. After a series of hostile dealings, letters, and phone conversations, Mr. Perez-Pena agreed to give the clients a refund of $1,600 if they agreed to sign releases of liability (note: this arrangement potentially violates RPC 1.8(h)(1), but was not included in the formal complaint). The clients agreed and went to Mr. Perez-Penaâ€™s office with the releases and the bounced check. The client husband went into the office, where he was disruptive. Mr. Perez-Pena called the police and the client husband left.Mr. Perez-Pena ultimately agreed to go to his bank to obtain a cashierâ€™s check for the clients, and the parties met to exchange the documents. During the exchange, the client wife tried to keep the check and grab the releases back from Mr. Perez-Pena. Mr. Perez-Pena pushed or hit the client wife, who ended up with the check but tore the release document in half. Mr. Perez-Pena thereafter reported the check stolen, and it bounced. The city of Seattle charged Mr. Perez-Pena with misdemeanor assault, and a jury convicted him on January 30, 2002. In February, the court granted Mr. Perez-Pena a deferred sentence. Mr. Perez-Pena completed the conditions of his deferred sentence and, in July 2003, the court vacated his judgment and sentence and dismissed the complaint. In May 2005, in anticipation of his disciplinary proceedings, Mr. Perez-Pena filed a motion to clarify the docket entries of July 2003 asking, inter alia, for the court to vacate the jury sentence. The court clarified that it had vacated the judgment and sentence and dismissed the complaint but, notably, it would not vacate the jury verdict. In May 2002, the clients filed a claim against Mr. Perez-Pena in small claims court for the unearned portion of the fee they paid to Mr. Perez-Pena. The court awarded the clients $1,431.45, which Mr. Perez-Pena has not paid. Mr. Perez-Penaâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, assault) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any unjustified act of assault or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; and former RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests upon termination of representation, such as refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned.M.

Leahy (WSBA No. 10912, admitted 1980), of Tacoma, was ordered to receive a reprimand on September 12, 2007, following a stipulation approved by a hearing officer. This discipline was based on conduct in 2006 involving deceptive conduct.In July 2006, Mr. Leahy called the home of an individual (KB) who had been in an automobile accident while driving her parentsâ€™ car. Mr. Leahy asked for KB, identified himself as Patrick Leahy, and said he was a representative of her parentsâ€™ insurer. In fact, Mr. Leahy represented the driver of the other car involved in the accident. Mr. Leahy also told KB that he had some documents he wanted to deliver the next day and asked when would be a good time to have them delivered. The documents to which he was referring were a summons and complaint instituting a lawsuit against KB and her parents based on the accident. KB asked Mr. Leahy to hold on and got her mother. At that point, KBâ€™s mother knew Mr. Leahy was not an agent of the insurance company, that he represented the other driver in the auto accident involving her daughter, that negotiations had broken down, and that they might be sued. She questioned Mr. Leahy about his identity. He again identified himself as Patrick Leahy from their insurer and asked whether anyone would be home the next day to receive some documents. KBâ€™s mother asked Mr. Leahy about his relationship to the documents, to which he eventually answered by stating that he was working with a process server. When asked if he was a lawyer, Mr. Leahy said no. Mr. Leahy eventually hung up. KB and her parents were served with a summons and complaint by a process server in late August 2006.Mr. Leahyâ€™s conduct violated RPC 4.1(a), prohibiting a lawyer, in the course of representing a client, from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.Joanne S.

In connection with his resignation in lieu of disbarment, Mr. Szabo admitted that the WSBA could prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence sufficient violations of the Rules of Professional conduct to result in his disbarment, but did not admit any specific misconduct. The misconduct and violations described in the Statement of Admitted and Alleged Misconduct (none of which are specifically admitted by Mr. Szabo) are as follows:Mr. Szabo operated Escrow Authority II (EA II), a real estate escrow business in connection with his law practice. At all times relevant to these matters, Mr. Szabo had access to, control of, and responsibility for EA IIâ€™s trust account, including the passwords for the account. Substantial sums of money were deposited and disbursed from EA IIâ€™s trust account in connection with real estate closings. Mr. Szabo was responsible for maintaining and recordkeeping for the EA II trust account, including reconciling the account. Although he had possession of the bank statements, Mr. Szabo did not reconcile the trust account to the bank statements or to the client ledgers on a monthly basis.In April 2002, Mr. Szabo prepared the incorporation documents for Western Trustee Services LLC (Western Trustee), which was owned by his law partner. Western Trustee handled reconveyances for EA II. Mr. Szabo also prepared the incorporation documents for Sammamish Title in October 2002. Mr. Szabo was manager of Sammamish Title, which handled the recording of documents for EA II. Mr. Szabo maintained, controlled, and was responsible for the bank accounts for Western Trustee and Sammamish Title, to which he deposited fees payable to Western Trustee and Sammamish Title. Mr. Szabo withdrew money from the Western Trustee and Sammamish Title bank accounts to pay bills for EA II, and otherwise treated the accounts as though they were EA II accounts.Between April 2005 and March 2007, Mr. Szabo engaged in the following conduct, which involved one or more of the before-mentioned businesses and/or another real estate escrow business that Mr. Szabo later operated in connection with his law office, Action Escrow:â€¢ Failed to disclose to clients that Western Trustee and Sammamish Title were affiliated with Mr. Szabo and/or with EA II, and that amounts paid to Western Trustee and/or Sammamish Title were actually payments to Mr. Szabo; â€¢ Failed to maintain funds belonging to clients and other third parties in the EA II trust account;â€¢ Failed to promptly pay to clients or to third parties the money belonging to them;â€¢ Intentionally misappropriated funds belonging to clients, and thereby committing the crime of theft in the third degree, a violation of RCW 9A.56.050;â€¢ Falsely notarized signatures on documents in violation of RCW 42.44.160 (official misconduct), RCW 9A.72.040 (false swearing), RCW 9A.60.050 (false certification that individuals appeared before you), RCW 40.16.030 (false statement on recorded instrument), and RCW 9A.60.020 (forgery);â€¢ Assisted and/or induced two nonlawyer employees to falsely notarize documents and failed to properly supervise them;â€¢ Failed to file a trust account declaration with the Bar Association as required by ELC 15.5 and failed to provide a response to a grievance in compliance with ELC 5.3(e).

This discipline is based on conduct in two matters involving failure to communicate and failure to promptly pay clients funds belonging to the clients.Matter 1: Siblings (clients) hired Mr. Holeman in May 2002 to represent them in a lawsuit arising from a motor vehicle accident in May 1999. The case settled in April 2005. Under the terms of the settlement, $3,000 was paid to each client for their injuries. The checks were sent to Mr. Holeman, and he forwarded them to the clients with instructions to endorse the checks and return them to him. The clients endorsed and returned the checks on July 12, 2005. The clientsâ€™ mother made numerous attempts to contact Mr. Holeman to find out when the checks would be disbursed. Mr. Holemanâ€™s phone was disconnected, and he did not respond to mail or e-mail. In November 2006, after the mother filed a complaint with the Bar Association, Mr. Holeman disbursed $3,000 to each client from his trust account. The funds were held in trust from July 12, 2005, until they were disbursed on November 20, 2006.Matter 2: Mr. Holeman represented a client (client) in a personal injury lawsuit. The parties settled the matter in September 2005, and the auto insurance company sent a settlement check to Mr. Holeman for $54,250. The clientâ€™s health insurance company asserted a lien against the settlement for the clientâ€™s medical expenses. Mr. Holeman disbursed the settlement proceeds to the client, but withheld $3,402.40 in his trust account to pay the lien. Mr. Holeman did not pay the money to the health insurance company. In January 2006, the client received a letter from her health insurance company requesting payment. The client contacted Mr. Holeman. However, Mr. Holeman did not pay the lien or tell the client that he had not paid it. The client eventually hired another lawyer to handle the uninsured motorist (UM) portion of her personal injury claim. In March 2007, the client paid the health insurance companyâ€™s lien out of the settlement proceeds of her UM claim. In June 2007, after the client filed a complaint with the Bar Association, Mr. Holeman paid her the $3,402.50 that he was holding in his trust account. The funds were held in Mr. Holemanâ€™s trust account from September 7, 2005, until they were disbursed on June 16, 2007.Mr. Holemanâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; and former RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by a client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive.Francesca Dâ€™Angelo represented the Bar Association.

Abreu (WSBA No. 14241, admitted 1984), of Renton, was disbarred, effective November 20, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on conduct involving two counts of theft.In January 2006, Ms. Abreu signed as escrow agent on a standby letter of credit escrow agreement for a financial transaction between a corporation located in Turkey (Corporation A) and a corporation located in Illinois (Corporation B). The purpose of the agreement was to allow Corporation B to obtain funds needed for construction of a power plant in India through lease of a standby letter of credit. Ms. Abreu's part in the transaction was simply to receive and hold the funds transmitted to her on behalf of Corporation B in her trust account and then to transmit them, less her fee, upon Corporation A's performance of its obligations under the agreement. To fulfill its obligations under the agreement, Corporation B went to outside investors and obtained $485,000, which was then wired directly to Ms. Abreu's account. The account that Ms. Abreu provided to receive the funds was not a trust account. Under the escrow agreement, Ms. Abreu was required to return the funds to the individual investors if Corporation A did not produce a required standby letter of credit within 45 international banking days of her receipt of the funds. Corporation A did not produce the letter within the required time. In November 2007, the president of Corporation B wrote Ms. Abreu demanding that the funds be wired to the individual investors no later than the third business day following his letter. Ms. Abreu failed to return the funds.  In April 2006, Ms. Abreu signed as escrow agent on a standby letter of credit escrow agreement for a financial transaction between the previously mentioned Corporation A and a biotechnology company located in Canada (Corporation C). The purpose of the agreement was to allow Corporation C to obtain funds needed for research through lease of a standby letter of credit. Ms. Abreu's part in the transaction was simply to receive and hold the funds transmitted by Corporation C in her trust account and then to transmit them, less her fee, upon Corporation A's performance of its obligations under the agreement. The agreement provided that if Corporation A did not perform its obligations under a related memorandum of understanding, the money was to be refunded less the escrow fee of $5,000. Pursuant to its obligations under the agreement, Corporation C wired $305,000 to Ms. Abreu. The account that Ms. Abreu provided to receive the funds was not a trust account. Corporation A did not perform its obligations and, in June 2006, the president of Corporation C wrote Ms. Abreu to request the immediate return of the company's money. Ms. Abreu returned $100,000 of the $305,000 in July 2006. Along with the funds, Ms. Abreu sent an e-mail stating that this amount was being sent ""while the accounting is concluded"" with the failed transaction. Corporation C informed Ms. Abreu, through outside counsel, of her obligation to refund the entire sum immediately upon notification that the transaction between the parties would not take place. Despite repeated requests, threats of bar complaints, and civil litigation, Ms. Abreu failed to return Corporation C's funds.In both matters, the majority of the funds associated with the transactions were either used by Ms. Abreu and transferred to her personal account or forwarded to individuals associated with Corporation A. Neither activity was authorized in either matter by the respective escrow agreements. Ms. Abreu's actions violated various state and federal prohibitions regarding theft and fraudulent use of wire transfers (including RCW 9.56.030 and 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1343) and deprived both Corporation B and Corporation C of needed funds.The Washington State Bar Association received grievances from Corporation C in October 2006 and from Corporation B in December 2006. Ms. Abreu avoided service in connection with these grievances and deliberately failed to cooperate with the disciplinary process.Ms. Abreu's conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any other act which reflects disregard for the rule of the law.Linda B.

912.html,24439,Thomas Juhl,,Disbarment,9/14/2007,,"Thomas Juhl (WSBA No. 24439, admitted 1994), of Seattle, was disbarred effective September 14, 2007, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation by the Disciplinary Board. In entering into the stipulation, Mr. Juhl agreed that if the matter were to proceed to a public hearing, there was a substantial likelihood that the Bar Association would be able to prove, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, the facts and misconduct described therein (and summarized herein). This discipline was based on his conduct in two matters involving neglect of legal matters, lack of communication, and making multiple misrepresentations to clients, to other attorneys, and to the court.Matter 1: In January 2004, a client hired Mr. Juhl to pursue a lawsuit against a former employer for back wages and they entered into a contingency-fee agreement. Mr. Juhl subsequently made the following misrepresentations to the client:â€¢  Mr. Juhl told the client that he filed a lawsuit on behalf of the client and served notice on the employer, filed and prevailed on a summary judgment motion against the employer, hired a private investigator to locate and freeze several of the employer's accounts, filed and prevailed on a motion to assess daily fines against the employer, and filed and prevailed on a subsequent motion to increase the daily fine against the employer. In fact, no lawsuit was filed, no judgments were obtained, and no motions were filed or granted.â€¢  Mr. Juhl gave the client two documents that appeared to be signed, conformed copies of court orders bearing a King County Superior Court cause number. The case number on the orders does not exist, and the orders had not been entered by the court.â€¢  Mr. Juhl told the client that he had received court approval for the sheriff to seize the employer's assets, that the sheriff's office was fined for not timely executing the seizure order, and that he collected a net recovery of $847,000 on behalf of the client. None of these statements were true.Between January 2004 and July 2005, the client filed for bankruptcy. The client's bankruptcy attorney informed the client that he had to list the ""recovery"" as an asset in his bankruptcy schedules and that Mr. Juhl had to file an application with the bankruptcy court for approval of any attorney fees he was owed from the ""recovery."" Mr. Juhl provided a sworn declaration for filing with the bankruptcy court indicating that, on a recovery of $847,000, he would be owed one-third for attorney's fees. The bankruptcy court entered an order directing Mr. Juhl to transfer $110,000 to the Chapter 13 trustee and to refund the remaining balance to the client. Mr. Juhl did not transfer the money, but later gave the client a check for $490,000 that appeared to be drawn on a personal account. There were insufficient funds in the account to cover the check. At a meeting in November 2005 with the client, and later in a phone call to the client's bankruptcy lawyer and in a sworn statement to the bankruptcy court, Mr. Juhl admitted that he had never filed the client's lawsuit, had not obtained a judgment, and had not collected any money for the client. Matter 2: In 2001, Mr. Juhl agreed to represent a client in an attempt to recover post-high school education expenses for the client's children from her ex-husband. Mr. Juhl did not charge the client a fee for this work. Mr. Juhl subsequently made the following misrepresentations to the client: â€¢  Mr. Juhl told the client that he had served her ex-husband with notice of a hearing they were seeking under an order of child support for the client's children entered in 1995. In fact, no matter had been filed or served.â€¢  Mr. Juhl gave the client copies of two documents, both of which appeared to be signed judgments indicating the client had been awarded judgments in the amount of $174,935 against her ex-husband. In fact, no judgments were obtained.Mr. Juhl told the client that she could have a lawyer from Maryland collect payment on the judgments (as the client's ex-husband lived in Maryland) and Mr. Juhl discussed with a Maryland lawyer subsequently hired by the client plans for a collection action against the ex-husband. Both the client and her Maryland lawyer requested certified copies of the judgments from Mr. Juhl. On one occasion, Mr. Juhl stated that he had sent the certified copies to the Maryland lawyer. In August 2005, the client went to Mr. Juhl's office, terminated his services, and requested her files. Mr. Juhl returned the files that had been given to him in 2001. The client subsequently hired another lawyer to represent her, who ascertained that no documents or judgments had been filed in the client's case after 1995. Mr. Juhl's conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; RPC 4.1(a), prohibiting a lawyer in the course of representing a client from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, forgery and unlawful issuance of a bank check) that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law.M.

Griffin (WSBA No. 16775, admitted 1987), of Santa Monica, California, was suspended for 30 days, effective February 12, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court imposing reciprocal discipline in accordance with an order of the Supreme Court of California following approval of a stipulation. This discipline was based on Ms. Griffin assisting in the transfer of correspondence between inmates in two different segregated sections of the same correctional facility without prior approval of the head of the facility. For more information, see the California Bar Journal (February 2008), available at http://calbar.ca.gov/state/calbar/calbar_home.jsp.Ms. Griffinâ€™s conduct violated the State of Californiaâ€™s Business and Professions Code, section 6068(a), which makes it the duty of an attorney to support the Constitution and the laws of the United States and of the state of California.Felice P.

915.html,14117,Thomas Sughrua,,Disbarment,2/20/2008,,"Thomas P. Sughrua (WSBA No. 14117, admitted 1984), of Seattle, was disbarred, effective February 20, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. Mr. Sughrua agreed that if the matter were to proceed to a public hearing, there was a substantial likelihood that the Bar Association would be able to prove, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, the facts and misconduct described herein. This discipline is based on conduct in four matters involving failure to maintain complete records of all clientsâ€™ funds coming into his possession and intentional misappropriation of clientâ€™s funds. Matter #1: Beginning in 2002, Mr. Sughrua represented a client in a dispute with a mortgage lender. The client gave Mr. Sughrua $10,000 in 2003 to be deposited in a court registry and then paid in whole or in part to the mortgage lender when the dispute was settled. Mr. Sughrua failed to maintain any records of the funds and intentionally misappropriated some or all of the funds for his own use. Beginning in 2004, Mr. Sughrua represented the same client in two separate personal-injury claims. Mr. Sughrua settled both of the clientâ€™s claims, one without her knowledge. In July 2005, Mr. Sughrua received settlement checks of $5,000 for the first claim and $8,750 for the second claim. Mr. Sughrua failed to notify the client of receipt of these funds and, without the clientâ€™s knowledge, endorsed the checks in the clientâ€™s name and deposited them into his lawyer trust account. Mr. Sughrua failed to maintain any record of these funds and intentionally misappropriated some or all of the funds for his own use. In January 2007, the client terminated the representation and the clientâ€™s new lawyer demanded that Mr. Sughrua return all of the clientâ€™s files and provide a written accounting of all the funds Mr. Sughrua had handled on the clientâ€™s behalf. In February 2007, Mr. Sughrua sent to the clientâ€™s new lawyer a check for $10,000 for the funds the client had given Mr. Sughrua in connection with the dispute with her mortgage lender. He also sent an accounting of the funds he had received in connection with the two personal-injury claims. In that letter, Mr. Sughrua stated that he was holding $7,995.36 in his trust account on the clientâ€™s behalf, and that he would continue working â€œat no extra chargeâ€ to compromise certain liens against the settlement funds. Mr. Sughrua has not disbursed any of the settlement funds to the client and, by March 2007, he had only $24.91 in his trust account.Matter #2: Mr. Sughrua represented a client in an appeal before the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals from a decision by the Department of Labor and Industries. Mr. Sughrua settled the clientâ€™s claim and received a settlement check for the amount of $2,138.40 in June 2006, which he deposited into his lawyer trust account. Mr. Sughrua failed to maintain any records of these funds and intentionally misappropriated some or all of the funds for his own use. Between June and December 2006, the client made numerous attempts to contact Mr. Sughrua to inquire about the settlement funds. Mr. Sughrua did not respond to the clientâ€™s inquiries. By December 8, 2006, Mr. Sughrua had only $22.23 in his trust account. On December 21, 2006, Mr. Sughrua sent to the client a check for $1,025.67 representing the clientâ€™s share of the settlement funds.Matter #3: In April 2005, Mr. Sughrua acted as the escrow closing agent with respect to the sale of commercial property by a corporation (seller) to a limited liability company (purchaser). In order to effect the transaction, the purchaser deposited $25,000 as earnest money with a realty company. The realty company transferred the earnest money to Mr. Sughrua, who deposited the funds into his lawyer trust account. Mr. Sughrua failed to maintain any records of the funds and intentionally misappropriated some or all of the funds for his own use. By July 2005, Mr. Sughrua only had $634.12 in his trust account. Between December 2006 and January 2007, lawyers for both parties sent at least five letters to Mr. Sughrua informing him that the parties had reached a settlement concerning the distribution of the earnest money and requesting that Mr. Sughrua distribute the earnest money in accordance with the settlement. Mr. Sughrua did not respond to these requests and did not distribute the money to either party. By January 16, 2007, Mr. Sughrua only had $20.94 in his trust account.Matter #4: In January 2003, Mr. Sughrua filed a wrongful death action on behalf of the estate of a decedent and the decedentâ€™s family. Mr. Sughrua reached a settlement with one of the defendants in November 2006. The defendantâ€™s insurer sent Mr. Sughrua two checks, each for $10,000 and each payable to one of the members of the decedentâ€™s family and to Mr. Sughrua as his or her attorney. Mr. Sughrua endorsed both checks, each in the name of the family member to whom the check was written, and deposited the checks into his lawyer trust account. Mr. Sughrua failed to maintain any records of these funds and intentionally misappropriated some or all of the funds for his own use. He did not disburse any of the settlement funds to the two family members to whom the checks were written. By March 2007, Mr. Sughrua only had $24.91 in his trust account. In June 2007, Mr. Sughrua reached a settlement with one of the remaining defendants, whose insurer sent Mr. Sughrua a check for $50,000 payable to Mr. Sughrua as attorney for the estate of the decedent. These funds were to be held in trust for the decedentâ€™s minor son. Mr. Sughrua deposited the funds into his lawyer trust account. He failed to maintain any records of the funds and intentionally misappropriated some or all of the funds for his own use. Mr. Sughrua has not disbursed any of the funds to either the decedentâ€™s minor son or to the decedentâ€™s estate. By August 2007, Mr. Sughrua had only $19,071.09 in his trust account.Mr. Sughruaâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and former RPC 1.14(b)(3) and current 1.15B(a), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them.Scott G.

916.html,28937,Anthony Castelda,,Suspension,4/7/2008,,"Anthony R. Castelda (WSBA No. 28937, admitted 1999), of Tonasket, was suspended for 60 days, effective April 7, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to deposit an advance fee into a trust account, treating a clientâ€™s advance fee as a flat fee without her informed consent and after representation had ended, failing to promptly provide a client with an accounting of the fees she had paid to him, and failing to promptly refund an unearned portion of a clientâ€™s advance fees.On February 1, 2006, Mr. Castelda met with a client for a consultation to discuss the clientâ€™s legal needs as a result of the recent death of her husband. The client wanted to have a will prepared for herself, change the names on two property deeds, change the names on three vehicle titles, and record her husbandâ€™s death certificate and their community property agreement which gave her title to the property. Mr. Castelda agreed to do this work; however, upon learning that she would have to meet Mr. Castelda at the Okanogan courthouse to change the title of three vehicles, the client informed Mr. Castelda that she would take care of transferring the vehicle titles herself. At the February meeting, Mr. Castelda and the client agreed that Mr. Castelda would bill at a rate of $150 per hour. Mr. Castelda ordinarily has all new clients sign his standard â€œRetainer and Fee Agreementâ€ that provides for â€œan initial feeâ€ that is to be billed against but which is described as a non-refundable retainer. The client declined to sign the proposed agreement. Thus, there was no written fee agreement between Mr. Castelda and his client, and the client did not agree to pay Mr. Castelda a nonrefundable retainer. The client left a check for $1,000 with Mr. Casteldaâ€™s front desk as she left the office that day. Mr. Casteldaâ€™s staff deposited the clientâ€™s $1,000 check into the law officeâ€™s operating account. Mr. Castelda believed the fee advance to be a nonrefundable retainer, and no funds of the client were ever held in Mr. Casteldaâ€™s client trust account. On February 2, 2006, Mr. Castelda sent the client a cover letter enclosing a draft will and asking her to bring in her original community property agreement so he could record it with the local County Auditorâ€™s Office. Mr. Castelda also sent the clientâ€™s late husbandâ€™s death certificate to the County Auditor for filing. On February 6, 2006, the client came to Mr. Casteldaâ€™s office and executed the will. On February 7, 2006, Mr. Castelda sent the clientâ€™s original community property agreement to the county auditor for filing. This concluded Mr. Casteldaâ€™s representation of the client other than providing the client with the recorded documents when they returned from the auditor. The client expected that she would receive a statement from Mr. Castelda in early March as to the portion of her $1,000 that had been used, but received no such statement. In March 2006, the client went to Mr. Casteldaâ€™s office to inquire about her account. Mr. Castelda was not in his office and his staff provided the client a statement dated March 1, 2006, from the Timeslips program that Mr. Castelda uses for billings. The statement showed $480 in hourly charges, $54 in costs expended, and a $466 credit balance. The client asked that the credit balance of $466 be refunded. Mr. Casteldaâ€™s office staff told the client she would need to talk to Mr. Castelda about a refund.In March 2006, Mr. Castelda spoke with the client and told her that no refund was owed, as there was a written fee agreement that provided that the $1,000 was a non-refundable retainer. The client disputed that there was a written fee agreement. Mr. Castelda agreed to review his file and call her back. He reviewed his files and verified that there was no written fee agreement. Mr. Castelda sent the client a letter admitting that he did not have a signed fee agreement for a non-refundable retainer. He explained his general practice to treat retainers as earned at the time they are paid, thus non-refundable. The letter stated: â€œGiven the type of work performed for you, and the services rendered, we feel treating this matter as a flat fee earned in the amount of $1,000 is more than reasonable.â€ The letter also informed the client that Mr. Castelda had discovered â€œrecording errorsâ€ in her billing records, which resulted in additional hourly charges of $445. Although the letter claimed $445 in additional charges, the additional entries of time that he put into the Timeslips billing program after the client raised the issue about his fees added only $377 in additional charges, leaving a credit balance of $89. Mr. Castelda believed it would have been reasonable to charge the client a $1,000 flat fee for the work he performed on her behalf. The client believed she agreed to hire Mr. Castelda on an hourly basis only. Mr. Castelda attempted to resolve his differences with the client by sending her a check for $89, the amount of the refund he thought she would be entitled to if he had agreed to work for her on a straight hourly fee basis, taking his recording errors into account. The client believed that Mr. Casteldaâ€™s recording errors, which increased his hourly fees, were unjustified. In July 2006, after the client filed a Bar complaint and disciplinary counsel urged him to refund the balance, Mr. Castelda refunded the balance of $377 to the client.Mr. Casteldaâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.5(a), requiring that a lawyerâ€™s fee be reasonable; former RPC 1.5(b), requiring a lawyer who has not regularly represented a client to communicate to the client the basis or rate of the fee or factors involved in determining the charges for legal services and the lawyerâ€™s billing practices; RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be affected and the client consents in writing after consultation and a full disclosure in writing of the material facts; RPC 1.8(a), prohibiting a lawyer who is representing a client in a matter from entering into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquiring an ownership, possessory, security, or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless the transaction and its terms are fair and reasonable and fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client, the client is given opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel, and the client consents; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm be deposited therein; former RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; former RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by a client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive; and former RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned.Leslie C.

Wetsel (WSBA No. 20720, admitted 1991), of Portland, Oregon, resigned in lieu of disbarment, effective February 25, 2008. In connection with his resignation in lieu of disbarment, Mr. Wetsel admitted that the WSBA could prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence sufficient violations of the Rules of Professional conduct to result in his disbarment, but did not admit any specific misconduct. The misconduct and violations described in the Statement of Admitted and Alleged Misconduct (none of which are specifically admitted by Mr. Wetsel) are as follows:In October 2006, Mr. Wetsel was hired to represent a client in a marital dissolution in Clark County, Washington. In January 2007, the client received a check for $243,371.19, which represented proceeds from the sale of the clientâ€™s marital residence. These funds were owned jointly by the client and his soon to be ex-spouse. Mr. Wetsel deposited the funds into his trust account in Oregon. In January 2007, Mr. Wetsel stopped working on the clientâ€™s dissolution. During January and February 2007, Mr. Wetsel did not return the clientâ€™s phone calls. Consequently, the client hired another lawyer to represent him. Mr. Wetsel intentionally removed approximately $94,000 of the clientâ€™s money from his trust account and used it for personal purposes without the knowledge, consent, or authority of the client. Mr. Wetsel intentionally did not respond to the clientâ€™s repeated requests to disburse $243,371.19. In June 2007, Mr. Wetsel was suspended by the Washington State Supreme Court for failing to pay State bar dues and by the Oregon State Bar for 18 months in a disciplinary matter involving six unrelated client matters. In September 2007, the Washington State Supreme Court entered an order of reciprocal discipline suspending Mr. Wetsel for 18 months, effective September 13, 2007. After being suspended from the practice of law in Oregon and Washington, Mr. Wetsel continued to hold approximately $150,000 belonging to the client in his trust account. He did not return these funds despite repeated requests by the client. Mr. Wetsel agreed to promptly disburse $150,000 to the registry of the Clark County Superior Court by December 28, 2007, and the remaining funds owed ($94,371.19) to the registry within 90 days.Mr. Wetselâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.15A(b), prohibiting a lawyer from using, converting, borrowing, or pledging client or third-person property for the lawyerâ€™s own use; RPC 1.15A(f), requiring  a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client or third person the property which the client or third person is entitled to receive; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, theft under RCW 9A.56.020) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.Jonathan Burke represented the Bar Association.

Haley (WSBA No. 19913, admitted 1990), of Seattle, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective December 12, 2000, following a default hearing. The discipline is based on his practicing while his license to practice law was suspended from 1998 through 2000.On June 17, 1998, the Supreme Court suspended Mr. Haleyâ€™s license to practice law for failure to pay his annual licensing fee to the Washington State Bar Association.

Mr. Haley remained suspended at the time of the June 2000 hearing.Matter 1: On May 1, 1998, Mr. Haley agreed to represent a client in post-conviction matters. The client had been convicted of first-degree assault. On May 29, 1998, Mr. Haley appeared in court on a motion and obtained a continuance of the clientâ€™s sentencing hearing. Mr. Haley took no further action on the clientâ€™s case. He did not notify his client of his suspension.Matter 2: In March 1998, Mr. Haley agreed to represent a client on a charge of driving under the influence. Mr. Haley filed a notice of appearance on March 26, 1998 and continued as counsel of record until May 1999. While his license was suspended, Mr. Haley represented the client in a jury trial and sentencing hearing.

In entering into the stipulation, Mr. Ryan agreed that if the matter were to proceed to a public hearing, there was a substantial likelihood that the Association would be able to prove by a clear preponderance of the evidence the facts and misconduct summarized herein. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to act diligently, lack of communication, trust-account irregularities, theft of client funds, dishonest conduct, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and violations of duties imposed under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct.Between December 2002 and January 2003, Mr. Ryan transferred a total of $10,150 from his trust account into his business and personal bank accounts, without entitlement or authority to the funds. Mr. Ryan used some or all of the converted funds to gamble at a local casino.Between December 2004 and July 2006, in four separate client matters, Mr. Ryan:â€¢ Failed to deposit advance fees and funds paid by clients into his trust account in three matters and used client funds in one matter on expenses unrelated to that clientâ€™s case;â€¢ Failed to maintain complete records of clientâ€™s funds coming into his possession in one matter;â€¢ Failed to keep clients in two matters reasonably informed as to the status of their cases and failed to promptly respond to their reasonable requests for information; andâ€¢ Failed to prepare draft wills for clients in one matter, failed to resolve a clientâ€™s case with reasonable diligence in a second matter, and failed to prepare and file a clientâ€™s petition to modify child support with reasonable diligence in a third matter.Mr. Ryan failed to provide written responses to grievances filed by clients in three of the four preceding matters, resulting in the Association subpoenaing Mr. Ryan to appear in two non-cooperation depositions. At the second deposition, Mr. Ryan failed to testify truthfully. In addition, Mr. Ryan agreed to provide the Association with certain files and documents by October 27, 2006, which he did not provide until December 2006 and January 2007.In March 2006, Mr. Ryan stipulated to a reprimand (stipulation) in order to resolve a 2005 client grievance filed against him. The hearing officer approved the stipulation on March 16, 2006. Pursuant to the stipulation, Mr. Ryan agreed to pay the client restitution of $3,510.50. Pursuant to ELC 13.7, payment of the restitution was due within 30 days after the stipulation was approved â€œunless the respondent enters into a periodic payment plan with disciplinary counsel.â€ Mr. Ryan did not enter into a payment plan to pay the restitution and did not pay the client any restitution until January 2007, when he sent the client a check for $150. In October 2006, the client filed a new grievance against Mr. Ryan for his failure to pay the agreed restitution.Mr. Ryanâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4(a), requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts maintained as set forth in the rules; former RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act (here, theft) that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter (here, ELC 5.3(e)).Leslie C.

93.html,20099,Jeffrey Werthan,,Reprimand,7/17/2001,,"Jeffrey M. Werthan (WSBA No. 20099, admitted 1990), of Issaquah, received a reprimand, following a hearing July 17, 2001. The discipline is based upon his failure to represent a client competently and diligently in 1998. (Jeffrey M. Werthan of Issaquah, Washington, is to be distinguished from Jeffrey M. Werthan of Washington, DC.)In May 1998, Mr. Werthan agreed to represent the personal representative of the estate of DH. The personal representative was one of DHâ€™s two brothers. At this same time, Mr. Werthan received a copy of the last will and testament, with handwritten changes. On June 11, 1998, Mr. Werthan filed a petition for appointment of the personal representative, stating that no will had been found. RCW 11.20.010 requires anyone having possession of a will to deliver the will to the court or the executor within a specified time. Mr. Werthan did not comply with this statute.If there had been no will, DHâ€™s father would have been the sole heir. Mr. Werthanâ€™s petition listed DHâ€™s two brothers as the sole heirs, with no mention of the father. Mr. Werthan did not obtain the personal representativeâ€™s verification of the petition, as required by RCW 11.28. 110. Mr. Werthan obtained a waiver of notice of nonintervention powers from one heir, but not all heirs, as required by RCW 11.68.041. Mr. Werthan also failed to provide the required notice of the appointment of the personal representative or publish required notices to creditors.A company that locates missing heirs contacted DHâ€™s father and told him he stood to inherit from an unnamed deceased relative. After the father contacted Mr. Werthanâ€™s client, Mr. Werthan wrote to his client that the handwritten changes invalidated the will, and there was no alternative but to proceed to open a probate without a will. DHâ€™s father refused to accept his share of the estate so that the brothers could inherit the estate; DHâ€™s estate paid $2,000 to the fatherâ€™s attorney. The court removed the personal representative and Mr. Werthan as the personal representativeâ€™s attorney, and admitted the will to probate. The court made a specific finding that Mr. Werthanâ€™s negligent and reckless actions in the handling of the estate were a substantial factor in the suspicions and mistrust among family members.Mr. Werthanâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.1, requiring lawyers to provide competent representation; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed of the status of their matters; and 8.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from engaging in misrepresentation.Patricia H.

930.html,20507,Robert Huff,,Reprimand,2/29/2000,,"Robert S. Huff (WSBA No. 20507, admitted 1991), of Mountlake Terrace, received two reprimands on September 29, 2000, by order of the Disciplinary Board following approval of a stipulation.  This discipline was based on conduct in two matters involving failure to provide competent representation, failure to act with reasonable diligence, failure to communicate, and engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.     Matter #1: From December 1992 until February 1996, Mr. Huff represented a client and the clientâ€™s two children as plaintiffs in a personal injury matter filed in superior court. Mr. Huff believed he had settled the case, and accepted a check tendered in full settlement of the claims of his client and the two minor plaintiffs. The client intended to settle, and believed that she had settled, only her own claim. Upon learning that the settlement appeared to include her daughterâ€™s claims, the client tried repeatedly to contact Mr. Huff. Mr. Huff failed to respond to the clientâ€™s attempts to inquire about the scope of the settlement. Mr. Huff disbursed the settlement proceeds despite the conditional tender on the part of the defendant lawyer, who required that the settlement documents be executed prior to disbursement. Mr. Huff also failed to obtain an order approving the minorsâ€™ settlement as required by SPR 98.16W. The lawsuit was dismissed by the clerk for want of prosecution. After the defendantâ€™s lawyer sought to set aside the order of dismissal and obtain an order dismissing the case with prejudice on the grounds of accord and satisfaction, Mr. Huff sought appointment of a guardian ad litem to address the minorsâ€™ claims. The court reopened the case and appointed a guardian ad litem, but Mr. Huff failed to take any action to resolve the finality of the settlement or to pursue the claims of the minor children.       Matter #2: During the course of a disciplinary investigation, the Association determined it was necessary to investigate Mr. Huffâ€™s trust account. After the audit, a Report of Examination (â€œAudit Reportâ€) was issued covering the period October 1, 1991, through June 30, 1995 (â€œaudit periodâ€). The Audit Report identified a number of instances during the audit period of noncompliance with trust account rules, including failure to maintain adequate records of receipt, deposit, and disbursement of client funds.     Mr. Huffâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.14(a), requiring that all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts and maintained as set forth in the rules; RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation; and RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.

This discipline is based on conduct involving the commission of a felony.In March 2005, Mr. Keith drove a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in Placer County, California. As a result of driving under the influence, Mr. Keith failed to stop for a red light and collided with another vehicle. Three other persons were injured in the collision. Police responded to the site of the collision and performed a blood alcohol test, from which Mr. Keithâ€™s blood alcohol content was determined to be .28, above the legal limit. In May 2006, Mr. Keith pleaded guilty to one count of Driving Under the Influence Causing Injury, a felony, in violation of Vehicle Code 23153(a) of the State of California, and was sentenced to a state prison for a term of 16 months.Mr. Keith violated Arizonaâ€™s Ethics Rule (ER) 8.4(b), making it professional misconduct for a lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.

Michaelsen (WSBA No. 3928, admitted 1959), of Spokane, received a reprimand on December 4, 2007, following approval of a stipulation by the hearing officer. This discipline was based on conduct involving failure to maintain complete trust account records, disbursement of funds in excess of funds clients had on deposit in his trust account, and disbursement of funds from the trust account before corresponding deposits had cleared the bank.Between July 2002 and July 2005, Mr. Michaelsen maintained an IOLTA client trust account, for which he failed to keep a check register with a running balance. During this time period, Mr. Michaelsen also failed to reconcile his trust account bank statements to his own records on a regular basis, failed to maintain ledgers for individual client matters, made deposits totaling $4,770.44 without identifying the client, and made withdrawals totaling $5,784.89 without identifying the client. During this time period, Mr. Michaelsen disbursed funds in excess of funds that the clients had on deposit in his trust account and before corresponding deposits had cleared the bank, resulting in a $5,559.28 shortage in his trust account. Upon being notified of the shortage by the Bar Association in November 2005, Mr. Michaelsen reimbursed his trust account; however, in some instances, he was unable to identify clients who had positive balances in his trust account. After Mr. Michaelsen and the Bar Association auditor were able to identify the clients who had positive balances in the trust account, Mr. Michaelsen refunded the positive balances to these clients in October and November 2007.Mr. Michaelsenâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.14(a), requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts maintained as set forth in the rules; and former RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and to render appropriate accountings to his or her clients regarding those funds.Kevin M.

Morris (WSBA No. 26190, admitted 1996), of Walla Walla, was disbarred, effective April 8, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct involving soliciting and accepting bribes. Tyler M. Morris is to be distinguished from James Tyler Moore of Walla Walla.At all relevant times, Mr. Morris was employed as an assistant city prosecutor for the City of Kennewick, which operated a recreation program (Home Base) that provided a place for teens to go after school. The City of Kennewick and the City Attorneyâ€™s Office permitted persons charged with misdemeanor criminal offenses and civil infractions to make donations to Home Base to have their cases dismissed or their charges significantly reduced. On more than one occasion between approximately January 1, 2005, and March 1, 2006, Mr. Morris, in his official capacity as an assistant city attorney, corruptly accepted and agreed to accept money from a defense attorney. Mr. Morris agreed to accept the money from the defense attorney intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with the reduction or dismissal of charges against the defense attorneyâ€™s clients in Benton County District Court. Mr. Morris asserts that he has no personal knowledge as to where the money he received from the defense attorney came from, or as to the intentions of the defense attorney or his clients as to where the money would be deposited. According to the plea agreement Mr. Morris signed on September 11, 2007, the money came from the defense attorneyâ€™s clients and was intended by the clients to be donated to Home Base operated by the City of Kennewick. Mr. Morris retained the money he received from the defense attorney for his personal use. It was not donated to Home Base. The value of the series of transactions involving payment of money to Mr. Morris from the defense attorney for the reduction or dismissal of charges during the relevant time period exceeded $5,000. The precise amount has yet to be judicially determined. In December 2006, Mr. Morris was charged by indictment with violating several federal statutes in connection with the facts set forth above. On September 11, 2007, Mr. Morris pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C.

The City of Kennewick and the city attorneyâ€™s office authorized persons charged with misdemeanor criminal offenses and civil infractions to make donations to Home Base to have their cases dismissed or their charges significantly reduced. One of the assistant prosecutors for the City of Kennewick (Mr. X), in his official capacity, solicited defendants who had charges pending against them to donate money to the Home Base program. Mr. X negotiated many cases that were favorable to defendants in return for donations to Home Base. From approximately January 1, 2005, until approximately March 1, 2006, Mr. Finney and Mr. X conspired to solicit money from Mr. Finneyâ€™s clients for donations to Home Base, which they then split between them for their own use. On multiple occasions, Mr. Finney told his clients that their criminal charges would be reduced or dismissed if they gave him funds to be donated to Home Base, and the clients gave him funds for donation to Home Base. He didnâ€™t tell his clients that some or all of the funds would be kept by Mr. X or by him for his own use. Mr. Finney gave money received from his clients to Mr. X in transactions valued at more than $5,000, in order to influence Mr. X as a city prosecutor to render favorable dispositions of his clientsâ€™ cases and to obtain money for Mr. X and himself. Over $160,000 of the donation money that should have gone to Home Base did not go into the Home Base account.

Mr. Pandher was required to provide his substance-abuse counselor proof of his attendance at the AA meetings. In March 2006, Mr. Pandher gave his counselor AA attendance slips, some of which appeared to have forged signatures. The counselor questioned Mr. Pandher about the dubious signatures, and he admitted to her that they were not genuine and that he had not attended the AA meetings corresponding to the questioned signatures. The counselor terminated Mr. Pandher from the program and reported the matter to the probation department. Mr. Pandher sought treatment at another facility.In May 2006, Mr. Pandher appeared in court and admitted that he forged some of the signatures on his AA attendance slips. Mr. Pandher told the court that he had missed some of the AA meetings because he had been trying to start up his own business and spent most weekends traveling to California, where his wife was finishing work on a graduate degree. The judge told Mr. Pandher that his conduct could impact his license to practice law. He placed Mr. Pandher on active probation and ordered him to stay in treatment.

He sent this check to the client in February 1995. The claim was never resolved because the insurance adjuster was not able to contact Mr. Everard. The adjuster tried to contact Mr. Everard several times by letter and telephone between November 1994 and August 1996 but received no response. The client also tried to contact Mr. Everard between February 1995 and April 1996 but received no response.In June 1994, the client asked Mr. Everard to pursue a dental malpractice claim. The dentist had left a paper tooth in the clientâ€™s mouth during a root canal, causing swelling and pain. The client believed that Mr. Everard had agreed to pursue this claim; however, Mr. Everard took no action on this claim. After February 1995, the client was not able to contact Mr. Everard.On June 8, 1995, the client filed a grievance against Mr. Everard, asking the Office of Disciplinary Counsel to assist him in contacting Mr. Everard. Disciplinary counsel wrote to Mr. Everard in July, August and September 1995, but received no response. On April 16, 1996, the client terminated Mr. Everardâ€™s services and requested that he make a copy of the clientâ€™s file available on April 19. On that date, the client went to Mr. Everardâ€™s office and found a note taped to the door stating that Mr. Everard did not have time to make copies of the clientâ€™s file and that he could have his original pictures back if he paid for them in advance. The client then asked the Office of Disciplinary Counsel to assist him in getting his file. Despite several attempts by the client and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, Mr. Everard did not release the clientâ€™s file until March 1997.Matter 2: Mr. Everard agreed to represent a client injured in a 1991 automobile accident. The case proceeded to mandatory arbitration in August 1995. At the hearing, Mr. Everard was sanctioned $750 for failing to file a timely arbitration brief. He paid the sanctions with a check that was returned due to insufficient funds. The arbitrator awarded Mr. Everardâ€™s client $6,294.50. Mr. Everard told the client that she had a year to appeal the arbitration award and that he would file an appeal if he could not negotiate a settlement for more than the arbitration award. Mr. Everard did not negotiate a higher amount, appeal the arbitration award, or collect the arbitration award.In September 1995, the client saw Mr. Everard in a nightclub. He told her that he had a $10,000 check waiting for her at his office, and to call him the next day to arrange to pick it up. The client called Mr. Everard several times between September 1995 and July 1996, but was not able to contact him. In mid-July, the client retained substitute counsel, who was not able to contact Mr. Everard and learned the status of the case from opposing counsel. Opposing counsel indicated that he would not disburse the arbitration award without a substitution of counsel signed by Mr. Everard.On July 22, 1996, the client sent a certified letter to Mr. Everard indicating that she had retained substitute counsel. The letter was returned unclaimed. Substitute counsel called Mr. Everard several times between August and October 1996, until the phone message stated that the party (Mr. Everard) would not accept incoming calls from substitute counselâ€™s number. Substitute counsel filed a motion for an order substituting counsel. At the hearing, the judge directed that notice again be sent to Mr. Everardâ€™s business address. On the morning of the second hearing, Mr. Everard delivered the client file and signed the substitution.Matter 3: In March 1997, Mr. Everard agreed to defend a client against charges of driving under the influence and with a suspended license. The clientâ€™s case was in Whatcom County and Mr. Everard was in Spokane County. Mr. Everard told the client that he would send paperwork after the client sent him $1,000. On March 29, 1996, the client paid Mr. Everard a $1,000 cashierâ€™s check. Approximately two days prior to the hearing, Mr. Everard contacted the client, said he would put the paperwork in the mail, and told the client to attend the arraignment himself and plead not guilty. The client appeared without counsel at the arraignment and pleaded not guilty. The client did not receive any paperwork from Mr. Everard prior to the May 23 pretrial conference date. The client called Mr. Everard several times, but received no response.On May 20, 1996, Mr. Everard called the client and indicated that he would ask the court for a continuance. On May 21 and 22, Mr. Everard told the prosecuting attorney he would be faxing a notice of appearance and sending the paperwork necessary for a continuance. Mr. Everard did not fax a notice of appearance or send any continuance documentation. The client called the court and found that Mr. Everard had not appeared or continued the conference. The client retained new counsel to appear at the pretrial conference.On May 24, 1996, the client sent Mr. Everard a letter demanding refund of his $1,000 within 10 days. In late July or August 1996, Mr. Everard called the client, stating that he had done some work on the case and should be paid for his work. Later, Mr. Everard agreed to refund $700, but did not send this amount to the client.In April 1997, Mr. Everard told the Office of Disciplinary Counsel that he had sent a $1,000 money order to the client and his new lawyer. His letter to disciplinary counsel included a copy of the money order. In October 1997, the client and lawyer indicated they had not received the money order. Mr. Everard then sent a money order dated October 31, 1997.Matter 4: In June 1995, The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) sent Mr. Everard a letter suggesting that he contact his client. He did not contact the client within a reasonable time. ODC made several informal attempts to obtain a copy of the clientâ€™s file. Although Mr. Everard promised to provide a copy of the file if the client paid the copying charge, neither the client nor ODC was able to contact Mr. Everard to obtain the copies and determine the cost. ODC sent Mr. Everard a request for a response to the clientâ€™s grievance, but Mr. Everard did not respond to this request. Mr. Everard did not claim the certified letter from ODC informing him that if he did not respond within 10 days he would be liable for the costs of his deposition.Mr. Everardâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 1.4, requiring lawyers to promptly comply with clientsâ€™ reasonable requests for information about their matters; 1.14(b)(4), requiring lawyers to promptly deliver client funds upon request; 1.15(d), requiring lawyers to take reasonable steps to protect clientsâ€™ interests upon withdrawal from representation; 8.4(d), prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; 1.5, requiring lawyersâ€™ fees to be reasonable; and RLD 2.8, requiring lawyers to promptly and reasonably respond to disciplinary counselâ€™s requests for information in disciplinary investigations.Leslie Allen represented the Bar Association.

940.html,10871,Robert Dompier,,Disbarment,5/15/2008,,"Robert Neil Dompier (WSBA No. 10871, admitted 1980), of Spokane, was disbarred, effective May 15, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct involving theft, dishonest conduct, violating a duty imposed by the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct (ELCs), and acts of moral turpitude.Mr. Dompierâ€™s grandparents established funds during their lifetimes for the education of their great-grandchildren. Mr. Dompierâ€™s father managed the funds until 1996. In 1996, Mr. Dompier assumed management of the funds and deposited them into individual accounts for his children and those of his three brothers. Individual trust accounts were established in the names of each child pursuant to the Washington Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, RCW 11.114.090 et seq. Mr. Dompier was custodian of each of the accounts and maintained complete authority over management of the accounts.In 1999, Mr. Dompier began investing in real estate. He purchased various pieces of real property as investments owned in Mr. Dompierâ€™s and his wifeâ€™s name. Mr. Dompierâ€™s investment plan entailed his managing the properties for a fee. The income produced by the properties would cover the expenses associated with the properties. As the values of the properties increased, Mr. Dompier planned to sell the properties. Mr. Dompierâ€™s plan did not work out as expected, and soon expenses began to exceed the income associated with the real estate properties. In 2000, Mr. Dompier began experiencing financial difficulties and began withdrawing funds to which he was not entitled from the custodial accounts and deposited the funds into his own personal accounts, using some of the funds for his own personal use, thereby unlawfully converting the funds. (Mr. Dompier specifically does not admit this conduct but does admit that there is a substantial likelihood the WSBA could prove it by a clear preponderance of the evidence.) By September 2003, all of the accounts were depleted of all funds and subsequently closed. Despite the use of the converted funds, Mr. Dompier continued to experience financial difficulties. In March 2004, Mr. Dompier wrote a letter to his brothers, nieces, and nephews acknowledging that he had used the money in the custodial accounts. He apologized and indicated that he would pay the money back, which totaled approximately $47,731. In July 2004, Mr. Dompier and his wife filed personal bankruptcy. Mr. Dompierâ€™s brothers were listed as creditors to whom Mr. Dompier owed money. These debts were for the funds Mr. Dompier took from the custodial accounts. As part of his personal bankruptcy, Mr. Dompier filed reaffirmation agreements with his brothers that reaffirmed the debt Mr. Dompier owed for the funds he withdrew from the accounts in a total amount of $48,331. In November 2004, a final decree was filed and Mr. Dompierâ€™s bankruptcy case was closed. Mr. Dompier has not made any payments or reimbursed his brothers or his nieces and nephews for the funds he took from the custodial accounts.In July 2006, the Association mailed the grievance to Mr. Dompier and requested that he submit a written response within two weeks. In August 2007, Mr. Dompier filed a response to the grievance stating that he had invested the funds in rental real estate on behalf of the beneficiaries, but that the real estate had been lost to foreclosure. Mr. Dompierâ€™s response was not complete or truthful in that his real estate investments were made in his and his wifeâ€™s name, not in the name of the trust beneficiaries, and Mr. Dompier did not invest the funds withdrawn from the custodial accounts in rental real estate.Mr. Dompierâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter (here ELC 5.3(e)); and RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, or corruption, or any other act which reflects disregard for the rule of law, whether the same be committed in the course of his or her conduct as a lawyer, or otherwise.

941.html,16381,John Mele,,Disbarment,5/21/2008,,"John P. Mele (WSBA No. 16381, admitted 1986), of Bellevue, was disbarred, effective May 21, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a hearing. This discipline resulted from conduct in a class-action lawsuit involving improper communication with represented class members and misrepresentations of material facts to the court and to opposing counsel. Mr. Mele represented a construction company and its owners in a class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit alleged that Mr. Meleâ€™s clients failed to provide their employees with meal periods or pay them for missed meal periods. The class was officially certified under CR 23(b)(2) in December 2002, contained all the employees of the construction company from April 1999 to those currently employed, and was represented by two attorneys certified as class counsel. In late January 2003, Mr. Mele prepared and e-mailed to one of his clients (employer) a generic declaration template. The declaration dealt exclusively with the legal defense of â€œwaiverâ€ of meal periods â€” that is, whether or not the employee chose to work without a meal period. The declaration recited facts about the claims made by the class, attested to the class memberâ€™s knowledge of Washington law, and concluded with an affirmative statement of â€œwaiverâ€ of meal periods by the class member. The employer needed only to insert the name and employment date of each class member. By agreement, the employer was to present the declarations to all class members for their review and signature, and then return all the signed declarations to Mr. Mele to be used as evidence in support of the legal defense of â€œwaiver.â€ The employer also mailed declarations to former employees and to those class members who could not come into the employerâ€™s office to sign the declaration in person. In February 2003, the employer notified Mr. Mele they had begun collecting signatures and sent to Mr. Mele checklists containing the name of each class member and the status of each class memberâ€™s declaration. The employer procured approximately 60 signed declarations, which were obtained without class counselsâ€™ knowledge or consent and without notification to class members that counsel represented them. The declarations formed the sole factual basis for Mr. Meleâ€™s Motion to Decertify Class, filed in March 2003. On February 25, 2003, a class member (Mr. S) contacted Mr. Mele to discuss the declaration he had received by mail from the employer. At a critical point during their phone conversation, when Mr. Mele realized he was speaking with a represented class member, he did not terminate the phone call. Instead, he continued the conversation about the subject matter of litigation. Mr. Mele advised Mr. S that he was not required to sign the declaration and that he would inform the employer that Mr. S would not be signing the â€œwaiverâ€ declaration.On February 26, 2003, Mr. Mele produced the declarations to class counsel as part of discovery. The day before, class counsel had heard from some of the class members who were concerned about documents they were being asked to sign by company management. On reviewing the declarations, class counsel immediately telephoned Mr. Mele to discuss what he viewed as an ethical violation. During that conversation and during a second one later that day, Mr. Mele stated that he had not spoken personally to any class members, although he had spoken to Mr. S the preceding day. In March 2003, Mr. Mele submitted a personal declaration, made under penalty of perjury, to the court for its consideration in a sanctions hearing. Mr. Meleâ€™s declaration was in response to a declaration filed by Mr. S attesting to his phone conversation with Mr. Mele. In his declaration, Mr. Mele knowingly misrepresented the material facts of the date, time duration, and sequence of his telephone conversation with Mr. S, and misrepresented his knowledge and the character of his involvement in his clientsâ€™ use of the generic declaration. In December 2002, class counsel had served interrogatories seeking a telephone list of class members. Mr. Mele had not provided the list by the January 2003 date that the interrogatories were due. At the March 2003 motion to compel/sanctions hearing, Mr. Mele knowingly misrepresented to the court why the list had not been turned over to class counsel. Mr. Mele informed the court that his client had concerns regarding turning over a telephone list of all their employees, but then asserted that he had instructed his client to do so. Mr. Mele did instruct his client in January 2003 to turn over a telephone list of all class members. However, after discovering in February 2003 that his client had not done so, and after assuring opposing counsel that same day he would get the phone list to him, Mr. Mele failed to reinstruct his client to produce the telephone list. At the March 2003 hearing, when Mr. Mele asserted he had directed his client to produce the list, Mr. Mele knew he had not done so since discovering his clientâ€™s failure to produce the list in February. Mr. Meleâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; former RPC 3.3(a)(4), prohibiting a lawyer from offering evidence that the lawyer knows to be false; former RPC 4.2, prohibiting a lawyer from communicating about the subject matter of the representation with a party the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer, without consent of the other lawyer; former RPC 8.4(a), prohibiting a lawyer from violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct; former 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and former RPC 8.4(d), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.Kathleen A.T.

942.html,21015,Paul Hernandez,,Disbarment,5/21/2008,,"Paul Hernandez (WSBA No. 21015, admitted 1991), of Seattle, was disbarred, effective May 21, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline was based on conduct involving incompetent representation, lack of diligence, settling a case without a clientâ€™s authorization, forging a clientâ€™s name, misappropriating and converting funds, misrepresentation, lack of communication, and trust account irregularities. Matter No. 1: In 2003, a client hired Mr. Hernandez to represent him in a personal-injury suit arising from a 2001 automobile accident. There was no written fee agreement. The client verbally agreed to pay Mr. Hernandez a contingency fee of one-third of any settlement amount. Mr. Hernandez verbally agreed that he would pay the clientâ€™s medical bills for accident-related health care from the proceeds of settlement. In 2004, Mr. Hernandez filed a personal injury suit on behalf of the client and subsequently settled the case without the clientâ€™s knowledge, consent, or authorization. Mr. Hernandez provided to the insurance company settling the claim a settlement release on which he falsely signed the name of the client. Mr. Hernandez obtained the settlement proceeds in the form of a check. He falsely signed the clientâ€™s name to the back of the check and deposited the funds into his account without telling the client that the case had settled or that he had received the proceeds of the settlement. From mid-2004 to 2005, Mr. Hernandez failed to pay the clientâ€™s medical bills and failed to return the clientâ€™s numerous phone calls requesting information about the status of his case. Mr. Hernandez used the settlement funds to cover shortages in his client trust account. In May 2005, Mr. Hernandez misrepresented to the client that the suit had just recently been settled and sent the client a check for $12,782.66 purporting to represent the clientâ€™s share of the settlement proceeds. At that time, Mr. Hernandez also promised the client that he would pay the clientâ€™s healthcare providers and would send the client an accounting of the settlement. Over the next several months, both the client and his medical providers left numerous telephone messages for Mr. Hernandez, to which he failed to respond. In August 2005, the client filed a grievance against Mr. Hernandez with the Bar Association. Mr. Hernandez failed to respond to the Bar Associationâ€™s request to answer the clientâ€™s grievance. Between August and November 2005, Mr. Hernandez paid the medical providersâ€™ outstanding bills and wrote a letter of apology to the client, which he sent with a final disbursement statement. In November 2005, Mr. Hernandez was personally served with a subpoena duces tecum requiring his appearance at the Bar Associationâ€™s offices for a deposition, along with a request for production of his trust account records. Mr. Hernandez did not appear for his deposition. In December 2005, Mr. Hernandez met with disciplinary counsel and admitted that he knew his trust account was short at least $4,000 in August 2005, that he did not keep a running balance in his check register, and that he was not maintaining client ledgers. Mr. Hernandez refused to allow disciplinary counsel to copy his check register. He agreed to produce, no later than December 16, 2005, copies of all his client files, general and trust account deposit receipts, bank statements, cancelled checks, and check registers, as well as computer printouts of client settlement statements from January 2004 to the present for review. Mr. Hernandez subsequently failed to produce any of the agreed-upon information, and he failed to respond to further calls and letters from the Bar Association. The Bar Association served Mr. Hernandez with another subpoena duces tecum for his deposition, but Mr. Hernandez failed to appear. In May 2006, the Supreme Court suspended him from the practice of law based on his non-cooperation with the Bar Associationâ€™s investigation. Matter No. 2: A client hired Mr. Hernandez to represent her in a personal-injury claim. In preparation for mediation of the claim in 2002, the client provided Mr. Hernandez with copies of her medical expenses and notices from one of her healthcare providers (Provider X) threatening court action for nonpayment of her medical bills. The client also referred phone calls from Provider X to Mr. Hernandez for resolution. The mediation resulted in a $3,000 settlement for the client. Mr. Hernandez and the client agreed that Mr. Hernandez would hold approximately $2,000 of the settlement monies in trust for payment of the outstanding medical bills, including one for Provider X. Mr. Hernandez and the client were to meet to pay the outstanding bills, but the meeting never occurred. Mr. Hernandez later advised the client that he had paid all her medical bills when, in fact, he had not done so. In 2003, Provider X filed suit and served the client with a summons and complaint. Mr. Hernandez received the summons and complaint from the client, told her that he â€œwould take care of it,â€ and reassured her that it would be dismissed. Mr. Hernandez failed to respond to the summons and complaint, and Provider X secured a default judgment against the client. In October 2004, while refinancing her home, the client learned that a collection agency had placed a lien in the amount of approximately $2,500 against her real property on behalf of Provider X. When confronted by the client in October 2004, Mr. Hernandez agreed to work without payment to remove the lien, but took no steps to satisfy the judgment or remove the lien. The client also requested that Mr. Hernandez pay her the full amount of her settlement proceeds, which Mr. Hernandez still held and had failed to distribute to the clientâ€™s healthcare providers. Mr. Hernandez agreed to return his fee of $1,000 and to disburse all of her remaining settlement funds. Mr. Hernandez never took steps to satisfy the judgment or to remove the lien, and failed to respond to phone calls or letters from the client about her matter. The client discovered an additional lien filed against her by another healthcare provider whose medical bill Mr. Hernandez failed to pay. Her credit was severely damaged by the ongoing presence of the unsatisfied judgment and liens. Although Mr. Hernandez left the client a message in May 2006 requesting that they arrange a time to meet to discuss how he could repair the damage to the clientâ€™s credit, he did not follow through with his request. Mr. Hernandez failed to answer the Bar Associationâ€™s requests for a response to the clientâ€™s subsequent grievance.Matter No. 3: In September 2006, the Bar Associationâ€™s auditor completed an audit of Mr. Hernandezâ€™s trust account records for the time period between September 29, 2004, and July 31, 2006. The auditor found that Mr. Hernandez made numerous withdrawals from his trust account in the form of checks, cashierâ€™s checks, and ATM withdrawals, but failed to record a client name or identify a client file on the checks, and that Mr. Hernandez removed funds from his trust account and converted the funds to his own use. The audit revealed that Mr. Hernandezâ€™s trust account was short of funds on at least 114 out of 671 days.Mr. Hernandezâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.5(b), requiring a lawyer who has not regularly represented a client to communicate the basis or rate of the fee or factors involved in determining the charges for legal services and the lawyerâ€™s billing practices to the client; former RPC 1.5(c), requiring contingent-fee agreements to be in writing and to state the method by which the fee is to be determined; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm to be deposited in one or more identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts maintained and set forth pursuant to the rules; former RPC 1.14(b)(1), requiring a lawyer to promptly notify a client of receipt of his or her funds, securities, or other properties; former RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, or other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 1.14(b)(4), requiring a lawyer to promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by the client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive; former 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act [here, theft in violation of RCW 9A.56.030] that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; former RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules for Enforcement of Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter (here, ELC 5.3).Kathleen A.T.

Sunderland (WSBA No. 22665, admitted 1993), of Clackamas, Oregon, was suspended for one year, effective May 21, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court imposing reciprocal discipline in accordance with an order of the Oregon Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct in several matters and includes engaging in dishonest conduct and conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice, assisting a client in fraudulent conduct, disregarding an order of the court, engaging in improper ex parte communication with the court, violating the rules on vicarious responsibility for another lawyerâ€™s conduct, failing to maintain clients â€˜funds in trust, and failing to maintain complete and accurate records of clientsâ€™ funds. For more information, see the December 2007 Oregon State Bar Bulletin, available at www.osbar.org.Mr. Sunderlandâ€™s conduct violated Oregon DR 1-102(A)(3), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; Oregon DR 1-102(A)(4) (and RPC 8.4(a)(4)), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; Oregon DR 7-102(A)(7), prohibiting a lawyer from assisting a client in conduct that the lawyer knows to be illegal or fraudulent; Oregon DR 7-106(A), prohibiting a lawyer from disregarding or advising a client to disregard a standing rule of a tribunal or a ruling of a tribunal made in the course of a proceeding; Oregon DR 7-110(B), prohibiting a lawyer in an adversary proceeding from communicating as to the merits of the cause with a judge or an official before whom the proceeding is pending except under certain exceptions; Oregon DR 9-101(A), requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited and maintained in one or more identifiable trust accounts in the state in which the law office is situated; Oregon DR 9-101(C)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to the client regarding them; and Oregon RPC 1.15-1(a), requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyerâ€™s possession separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property; Oregon RPC 1.15-1(c), requiring a lawyer to deposit into a lawyer trust account legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance, to be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned or expenses incurred; and Oregon RPC 5.1, making a lawyer responsible for another lawyerâ€™s violation of the ethics rules if the lawyer orders or ratifies the conduct involved, or the lawyer is a partner or has comparable managerial authority in the law firm in which the other lawyer practices, or has direct supervisory authority over the other lawyer and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated.Felice P.

944.html,29978,Noel Lerner,,Suspension,5/23/2008,,"Noel Lerner (WSBA No. 29978, admitted 2000), of Enumclaw, was suspended for six months, effective May 23, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court. This discipline is based on conduct in two matters involving lack of competent representation, failure to communicate, failure to act with reasonable diligence and make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation, false statements to a tribunal, trust-account irregularities, failure to take steps reasonably necessary to protect clientsâ€™ interests, and violations of a court order.Matter No. 1: Ms. W and her first husband were married in Washington and had four children before dissolving their marriage in another state. Although the children lived with Ms. W at first, she later remarried and lived out of state while the children eventually returned to Washington with her ex-husband. He obtained a default judgment against Ms. W in a Washington court, requiring her to pay a substantial amount of child support and establishing a cumbersome visitation plan.In December 2003, Ms. W found Ms. Lerner on the Internet and hired her from outside the state to try to modify the Washington support order and visitation. They executed a fee agreement that specified Ms. Lerner would provide itemized bills on a regular basis. Ms. Lernerâ€™s approach was to challenge jurisdiction and nullify the prior court orders and thereby obtain a complete reversal of the custody arrangement, but her client repeatedly stated that her goal at the time was only to modify the orders, rather than disrupt the childrenâ€™s lives with an abrupt change of custody. At the time, Ms. W was working and the support obligation consumed a large portion of her income; in the course of the representation, she had another child and became unemployed, making the support obligation even more burdensome.Over a period of eight months, Ms. Lerner filed no pleadings and took no action to further her clientâ€™s objectives. She lacked the level of competence necessary to address the jurisdictional issues and ultimately ignored the matter. Meanwhile, Ms. W sent increasingly urgent e-mails inquiring about the status of her case, but received little or no response; when she repeatedly requested an accounting of her fee deposit, she received none.In August 2004, Ms. Lerner withdrew from Ms. Wâ€™s case without informing her client. After Ms. W filed her grievance, Ms. Lernerâ€™s office generated a reconstructed billing statement but she did not send it to her client. She ultimately refunded Ms. Wâ€™s fee.Matter No. 2: Mr. Y was the subject of an administrative action to collect child support based on his having signed an affidavit acknowledging paternity of a child. The childâ€™s mother received financial assistance from the state of Washington, which then instituted proceedings against Mr. Y to recover the amount of that assistance. However, the childâ€™s mother later submitted an affidavit stating that another man, not Mr. Y, was actually the childâ€™s father and was supporting the child.Mr. Y hired Ms. Lerner to take action to relieve him of the support obligation. When she appeared in the administrative support proceedings on Mr. Yâ€™s behalf, Ms. Lerner was informed that it was not within the jurisdiction of the administrative judge to grant the relief she sought. Ms. Lerner was told that she would first need to petition the Superior Court in order to disestablish Mr. Yâ€™s paternity, and the administrative proceedings were continued to afford Ms. Lerner the opportunity to do so.For nearly two years, Ms. Lerner obtained numerous continuances based on her false representations to opposing counsel and the administrative court that she was seeking relief in superior court. In the meantime, her client was obligated to continue paying the state installments on the balance it was due. The administrative judge finally ordered Ms. Lerner to provide a declaration as evidence that she had taken action in superior court, but Ms. Lerner failed to comply. By the time she moved to initiate action in superior court, her client had finished paying the Division of Child Support more than the amount it originally sought and the administrative proceedings were closed.Ms. Lernerâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; former RPC 1.2(a), requiring a lawyer to abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and to consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; RPC 3.3(a)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; RPC 1.15(d), requiring a lawyer to take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client; and RPC 8.4(j), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully disobeying or violating a court order directing him or her to do or cease doing an act which he or she ought to do or cease doing in good faith.Natalea Skvir represented the Bar Association.

945.html,19758,George Trejo,,Suspension,6/12/2008,,"George Trejo Jr. (WSBA No. 19758, admitted 1990), of Yakima, was suspended for three months, effective June 12, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. This discipline resulted from conduct involving trust-account irregularities and lack of supervision of a non-lawyer assistant. The suspension is to be followed by two yearsâ€™ probation. For more information, see In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Trejo, 185 P.3d 1160 (2008).Since 1995, Mr. Trejo maintained a solo practice with one employee (Ms. G). In May 2003, the Bar Association received notification that Mr. Trejoâ€™s trust account was overdrawn. A few days later, a certified public accountant employed as an auditor by the WSBA requested an explanation of the overdraft. Mr. Trejo explained that Ms. G, after being confronted, admitted to writing checks to herself from the trust account without Mr. Trejoâ€™s permission. Ms. G would deposit the check into her personal checking account to cover personal debts and, later, when her personal account was sufficiently funded, she would write a check back to the trust account. This happened approximately 12 times in amounts ranging from $20 to $2,050.Ms. Gâ€™s check-floating scheme delayed payments to one of Mr. Trejoâ€™s clients, who was receiving checks every two weeks from the Department of Labor and Industries (L&I). The L&I check was deposited into Mr. Trejoâ€™s trust account. Mr. Trejo would then issue a check for 90 percent of the L&I check to the client and issue a check to either himself or to Ms. G for the remaining 10 percent. During the period of January 2002 to May 2003, there were insufficient funds in the client trust account to timely pay the client on five separate occasions. The shortages lasted from a few days to a few weeks. Once Ms. G replenished the trust account, a check was written to the client. Around May 2003, Ms. Gâ€™s check to the trust account bounced. This, in turn, caused the check issued to the client to bounce and resulted in an overdraft notification. Ms. G also admitted to misappropriating two payments for her personal use. She took a check for $860, endorsed it by signing Mr. Trejoâ€™s name, cashed the check, and then misappropriated the funds. Another incident involved a wire transfer of $2,000 into the trust account. Ms. G issued to herself a check for $2,000, again signing Mr. Trejoâ€™s name without his permission. Ms. G was authorized to sign checks using Mr. Trejoâ€™s name, but Mr. Trejo was unaware of any of these activities prior to the May 2003 overdraft notification, because he did not review his bank statements. Mr. Trejoâ€™s law office maintained inadequate trust-accounting procedures and records. His records for the trust account â€œconsisted solely of a handwritten journal that listed the number of the checks written out of the trust account, the date on which the check was issued, the payee, and the amount of the check.â€ Some of the checks noted which client was associated with the check. Three trust-account checks were not accounted for in the journal. The journal did not track deposits or reflect a running balance. Mr. Trejo kept his monthly bank statements, but did not review them. Mr. Trejo did not reconcile his journal with the bank statements. Mr. Trejo did not maintain individual client ledgers or any records that could be that could be used to accurately determine client balances in the trust account. Thus, Mr. Trejo could not identify the funds in the trust account that belong to each client.Mr. Trejo did not maintain a bank account in Washington for his personal or business funds. When Mr. Trejo received a check or wire transfer from a client, the funds were deposited into the trust account regardless of their nature. Earned fees were deposited into the trust account 66 times during the audit period. The earned fees constituted $117,782.74 of the $150,599.66 deposited into the trust account from January 2002 to May 2003. Once the earned fees were deposited, a trust-account check was issued to Mr. Trejo or Ms. G, who then cashed the check and kept the cash in Mr. Trejoâ€™s office. Other than the L&I check deposits, client funds were deposited into the client trust account nine times during the audit period. In one instance, Mr. Trejo deposited money into the client trust account and then issued a trust-account check to pay for a personal debt. At the conclusion of her audit, the WSBA auditor explained the proper procedures for handling a trust account and keeping complete records. In March 2004, the auditor conducted a follow-up audit of Mr. Trejoâ€™s trust account. The auditor concluded that Mr. Trejo implemented a number of her recommendations; however, the auditor also found that Mr. Trejo failed to use client ledgers consistently, failed to identify deposits by clients, and failed to reconcile the client ledgers to the check register. Mr. Trejo also continued to deposit earned fees into the client trust account.Mr. Trejoâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.14(a), requiring all funds of a client paid to a lawyer or law firm be deposited in one or more interest-bearing trust accounts maintained as set forth in the rules; former RPC 1.14(b)(3), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; and former RPC5.3(b), requiring a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over a non-lawyer to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the personâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer.Debra J.

Mathis (WSBA No. 27090, admitted 1997), of Kent, was ordered to receive a reprimand on May 12, 2008, following approval of a stipulation by a hearing officer. This discipline resulted from engaging in conduct that led to conviction of a misdemeanor under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.Mr. Mathis co-owned and operated Business Office Suite Services (BOSS), which provided business services such as bookkeeping functions, paralegal support, and office space to clients. Mr. Mathis mostly handled estate-planning matters, document preparation, powers of attorney, tax preparation, and setting up Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs). During the fiscal year ending March 31, 2004, BOSS failed to file an income-tax return. Mr. Mathis knew that he had to timely file BOSSâ€™s tax return and timely pay the income taxes due, and intentionally failed to do so. The amount of tax due was $54,667. BOSS initially did not file the tax return based on erroneous advice from accountants as to whether any taxes were owed. In 2005, the IRS began investigating BOSS in connection with its tax filing and reporting requirements. As a result of the IRS inquiry, BOSS hired a forensic accountant to reconstruct the companyâ€™s financial records to determine if it had any tax liabilities during fiscal year 2004. The IRS was aware of this process, which took two years and extended past the IRS-imposed deadline. BOSS did not file the tax returns before the deadline because the directors were unsure of the amount due.In November 2006, Mr. Mathis was charged with violating 26 U.S.C. Â§ 7203, a misdemeanor. Mr. Mathis pleaded guilty in May 2007. He was placed on probation for three years and was required to report his conviction to the Association. The delinquent tax return has been filed, and all back taxes and penalties have been paid.

948.html,27282,Dean White,,Reprimand,5/12/2008,,"Dean E. White (WSBA No. 27282, admitted 1997), of Spokane, was ordered to receive a reprimand on May 12, 2008, following a stipulation approved by a hearing officer. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to diligently represent a clientâ€™s interests, lack of communication, and a conflict of interest.On August 25 and 28, 2006, a client contacted Mr. Whiteâ€™s office to hire Mr. White to handle three traffic infractions with which the client had been charged. Mr. White had no record or recollection of these calls. The client initially represented himself and arranged with the prosecutor and the court to have all three matters scheduled to be heard at the same time on August 30, 2006. At the August hearing, the client obtained a continuance until September 27, 2006, because he wanted to hire Mr. White or another lawyer to assist him in resolving the matters. In early September 2006, the client moved to Hawaii. Prior to September 27, 2006, the clientâ€™s mother contacted Mr. White about representing her son. There are conflicting accounts as to whether the clientâ€™s mother told Mr. White about all three of the traffic violations. For the purposes of the stipulation, the parties agreed that Mr. White was informed about only one of the traffic infractions; however, Mr. White would have known about the other traffic infractions had he had direct contact with the client. On September 25, 2006, the clientâ€™s mother issued a $250 check to Mr. White to represent her son in connection with the traffic infractions. Mr. White received and cashed the check on October 4, 2006. The client understood that Mr. White would be appearing on his behalf at the September 27, 2006, hearing. There are conflicting accounts as to whether Mr. White told the clientâ€™s mother that he was going to appear at the September 27, 2006, hearing. In any event, Mr. White did not appear on behalf of the client at the hearing. As a result of Mr. Whiteâ€™s failure to appear on behalf of his client, the Court issued orders against the client for failing to appear in all three traffic matters. On October 3, 2006, the Court entered judgments against the client in the amounts of $560, $302, and $153, and prepared the first notice of collection for each judgment. The judgments were assigned to a collection agency in November 2006. Consequently, the clientâ€™s driverâ€™s license was suspended and the client lost his job as a delivery person. On December 27, 2006, Mr. White filed a notice of appearance in one of the three traffic offenses filed against the client.Starting in October 2006, Mr. White engaged in discussions with the prosecutor regarding the resolution of one of the three traffic infractions. At this time, Mr. White learned of the two other traffic infractions and incorrectly presumed that the client intended for him to handle only one of the three traffic infractions. This misunderstanding could have been remedied had Mr. White had direct contact with the client. Mr. White never disclosed or relayed to the client the substance of his settlement discussions with the prosecutor during October and November 2006. Mr. White never had any contact with the client regarding the traffic infractions until several months after the client discovered that judgments had been entered in all three matters. Mr. White did not have any contact information for the client, and never attempted to obtain this information from the clientâ€™s mother. Mr. White discussed the substance of the settlement negotiations with the clientâ€™s mother, and allowed her to decide whether to accept or decline the prosecutorâ€™s offers without the clientâ€™s consent or knowledge of the offers. The client ultimately hired another lawyer in June 2007 to resolve the orders for failing to appear, remove the traffic infractions from collection, and reset the matters for contested hearings.Mr. Whiteâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; RPC 1.8(f), prohibiting a lawyer from accepting compensation for representing a client from one other than the client unless the client consents after consultation, there is no interference with the lawyerâ€™s independence of professional judgment or with the client-lawyer relationship, and information relating to the representation of a client is protected as required by the rules.Jonathan Burke represented the Bar Association.

95.html,20234,Kevin Moran,,Suspension,9/1/2000,,"Kevin M. Moran (WSBA No. 20234, admitted 1990), of Spokane, has been suspended for one year effective September 1, 2000, by order of the Supreme Court, approving a stipulation. The discipline is based on his temporarily abandoning his practice without proper notice to his clients and failing to diligently represent several clients. (Note: Mr. Moran is to be distinguished from Kevin Patrick Moran of Silverdale.)Matter 1: On December 16, 1992, Mr. Moran filed a notice of appearance on behalf of a client charged with driving under the influence. At the time, Mr. Moran was employed by the Seattle Public Defenderâ€™s Office. He obtained a continuance of the clientâ€™s pretrial hearing and told the client to wait to hear from him. Although standard procedure for the Public Defenderâ€™s Office is to notify defendants of all mandatory court dates, the clientâ€™s file contained no evidence that Mr. Moran had notified him of the hearing date. Neither Mr. Moran nor the client appeared for the hearing. Subsequently, the court issued a bench warrant for the clientâ€™s arrest. The clientâ€™s file does not indicate that Mr. Moran had notified the client of the bench warrant.Mr. Moran resigned from the Public Defenderâ€™s Office effective August 31, 1993. On September 3, 1993, the office administratively closed the clientâ€™s file for lack of contact. The client contacted Mr. Moran at his new office several times, but Mr. Moran did not respond. In May 1996, the client was stopped for a nonworking headlight and then booked into jail on the outstanding warrant.Matter 2: In February or March 1994, Mr. Moran opened a law office as a solo practitioner. In March 1995, a court commissioner appointed Mr. Moran to represent a client on a contempt motion for failure to pay child support. On this same day, the commissioner continued the clientâ€™s hearing from March 27 until May 1, 1995. Mr. Moran spoke to his client on April 19, 1995, and then arranged for several continuances, the last to June 3, 1996. Neither Mr. Moran nor his client appeared at the contempt hearing. The deputy prosecuting attorney called Mr. Moran about the missed court date, but he did not return her call.On June 7, the deputy prosecutor sent Mr. Moran a letter enclosing a civil bench warrant. The letter explained that the warrant would be forwarded to the sheriff if Mr. Moran did not contact her and arrange for the client to pay the past-due child support and explain his failure to attend the hearing. Mr. Moran did not respond to the letter, and the prosecutor forwarded the bench warrant to the sheriff. On September 12, 1996, the client was arrested. During a hearing on September 13 the court discharged Mr. Moran.Matter 3: On May 2, 1995, Mr. Moran agreed to represent a client in a Department of Licensing (DOL) hearing. The hearing officer ruled against the client. The May 3 decision included a notice that the client could appeal the decision in the county of his arrest within 14 days of the decision. The notice specified that a $40 cover fee must be submitted with the notice of appeal, to cover the cost to prepare the administrative record. On May 9, 1995, the client requested that Mr. Moran appeal the DOL hearing decision.The client told Mr. Moran that he was going to Arizona for the summer, but he called Mr. Moran several times between May 12 and August 12, 1995. Mr. Moran did not return the clientâ€™s calls. On one occasion, the client found Mr. Moran in the office, and Mr. Moran assured him that he was working on the appeal.Mr. Moran filed the notice of appeal on June 7, 1995, with a notation that he would file the brief at a later date. Mr. Moran never filed a brief. Mr. Moran did not notify DOL of the appeal within the 14-day period, nor did he submit the $40 to cover the costs of the record.In August 1995, the client returned to Washington and left several messages for Mr. Moran. Mr. Moran did not return his calls. The client finally reached Mr. Moran and scheduled an appointment for November 24, 1995, but Mr. Moran cancelled this meeting. On January 13, 1996, the client discharged Mr. Moran and requested a refund. Mr. Moran did not respond until December 1999, when he refunded the clientâ€™s fees.Matter 4: Mr. Moran did not respond to the Bar Associationâ€™s written requests for information regarding these matters. On January 24, 1997, the lawyer representing Mr. Moranâ€™s landlord contacted the Bar Association. Mr. Moranâ€™s landlord was attempting to evict him from his office space for nonpayment of rent, and intended to place Mr. Moranâ€™s office furniture and files in storage. After several attempts to contact Mr. Moran, the Bar Association filed a motion for the appointment of a custodian for Mr. Moranâ€™s trust account, client files and client records. The Disciplinary Board chairman granted the motion, and a custodian took possession of Mr. Moranâ€™s files, records and trust account.Mr. Moran appeared for a deposition on June 25, 1997. He agreed that he was willing and able to take responsibility for his files. On October 14, 1997, the custodian was discharged. Mr. Moran took responsibility for his files on March 11, 2000.Mr. Moranâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed of the status of their matters and to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; 3.4(c), prohibiting lawyers from knowingly disobeying obligations under the rules of the tribunal, except for an open refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists; and RLD 2.8, requiring lawyers to promptly comply with requests for information relevant to grievances.Henry Haas represented the Bar Association.

This discipline is based on his failure to diligently represent and communicate with a client. (Note: Mr. Miller is to be distinguished from Thomas J. Miller of Spokane.)On January 31, 1996, Mr. Miller agreed to represent two clients in a timber conversion case. Large cedar trees had been cut from the clientsâ€™ property without their permission. Mr. Miller filed a lawsuit against the adjacent property owners (the Ms), alleging they converted his clientsâ€™ timber. During discovery, Mr. Miller learned that the Ms hired a logger to cut timber along the boundary of their property. The logger allegedly converted timber from both the Ms and Mr. Millerâ€™s clients. The logger was subsequently indicted for other counts of timber theft, but not for the Msâ€™ or the clientsâ€™ timber. After deposing the Ms, Mr. Miller told his clients he did not believe their lawsuit would survive a summary judgment. The clients then instructed Mr. Miller to settle the lawsuit if the Ms would grant them an easement over their property. Mr. Miller notified opposing counsel of the settlement offer.On September 17, 1996, the Ms agreed to the settlement proposal. After several drafts and negotiations, opposing counsel sent the final documents to Mr. Miller on April 28, 1997. Opposing counsel contacted Mr. Miller several times during May regarding the documents. On May 14, 1997, Mr. Millerâ€™s clients executed the settlement and easement documents.During May, Mr. Miller was being treat-ed for depression. The treatment medication interfered with his ability to function in his law practice. In June, Mr. Miller stopped taking his medication and changed doctors. Also during June, opposing counsel contacted Mr. Miller several times regarding the settlement. Mr. Miller did not return his calls.On July 11, 1997, the Ms authorized their lawyer to draft a summary judgment motion seeking dismissal of all claims. He completed the motion on August 1 and received the executed settlement documents on August 5. The Ms decided not to accept the settlement, and filed the summary judgment motion.On November 13, 1997, Mr. Miller signed a stipulation to dismiss the Ms from the lawsuit. Mr. Miller did not tell his clients that the Ms had been dismissed, and continued to represent them in claims against the logger. Later, the clients learned that the logger did not have substantial assets and decided to stop pursuing him. The clients did not recover any damages from the conversion of their timber.Mr. Millerâ€™s conduct violated RPCs 1.3, requiring lawyers to diligently represent their clients; and 1.4, requiring lawyers to keep their clients informed of the status of their matters and to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.Jonathan Burke represented the Bar Association.

Hamley (WSBA No. 1028, admitted 1969), of Bellevue, was disbarred, effective July 9, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline was based on conduct involving conversion of estate funds and submitting false declarations to the court. Mr. Hamley drafted wills for a married couple, Mr. and Mrs. W, naming himself to serve as executor or personal representative (PR) of both estates. Mr. and Mrs. W jointly owned a note and deed of trust for monies they had loaned. Mrs. W died in September 2000; Mr. Hamley filed a probate petition in King County Superior Court in December 2000 and a declaration of completion to close Mrs. Wâ€™s estate in June 2005. Mr. W died in August 2004; Mr. Hamley filed a probate petition in King County Superior Court in October 2004. Mr. Wâ€™s will named his stepson and Mr. Hamley as co-PRs. Mr. Hamley also served as attorney for the co-PRs.In May 2005, Mr. Hamley received payoff proceeds totaling $37,124.05 for the note and deed of trust (the estate funds). Mr. Hamley did not deposit the estate funds to an estate bank account. Instead, he deposited the estate funds to his trust account. In or about August 2005, Mr. Hamley withdrew over $21,000 by cashierâ€™s check from the estate funds in his trust account. He did not tell his co-PR about the withdrawal, and he took the funds without authorization. Mr. Hamley used the money to insulate himself from potential legal liability to another client. Later, he testified that he used the funds to protect himself, because â€œI didnâ€™t have other funds available.â€ On May 8, 2006, Mr. Wâ€™s stepdaughter (Ms. A), who was a beneficiary of his estate, filed a petition for removal of the co-PRs. Ms. A sought appointment of a successor PR and an accounting. On May 26, 2006, in response to the petition for removal, Mr. Hamley signed and filed a declaration with the court in which he falsely swore that â€œall fundsâ€ of the estate had been deposited to an estate account. In fact, Mr. Hamley had deposited over $37,000 in estate funds to his trust account. On June 1, 2006, the court ordered Mr. Hamley to resign as co-PR, blocked certain bank accounts, and awarded attorneyâ€™s fees against Mr. Hamley and Mr. Wâ€™s stepson personally for fees incurred by the heirs in bringing the removal proceedings. On June 19, 2006, by a stipulated order, the court removed Mr. Wâ€™s stepson as co-PR and appointed Ms. A as the new PR. Mr. Hamley repaid the $37,000 in estate funds described above and associated attorney fees.Mr. Hamleyâ€™s conduct violated RPC 3.3(a), prohibiting a lawyer from making a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal; RPC 4.1, prohibiting a lawyer, in the course of representing a client, from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(i), prohibiting a lawyer from committing any act involving moral turpitude, corruption, or other act which reflects disregard for the rule of the law, regardless of conviction or acquittal of a felony or a misdemeanor.Linda B.

969.html,8212,Gregory Zoro,,Disbarment,7/9/2008,,"Gregory S. Zoro (WSBA No. 8212, admitted 1978), of Des Moines was disbarred, effective July 9, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline resulted from conduct in four matters involving failure to communicate; lack of diligence; trust account irregularities; forgery; and conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation.Between approximately October 2002 and May 2007, Mr. Zoro engaged in the following conduct:â€¢ Failure to respond to repeated requests for information from a client and from a third party involved in a personal-injury matter, and failed to respond to messages left by a client in a second personal injury matter;â€¢ Failure to timely pay amounts due to third-party insurers after cases were settled and funds received by Mr. Zoro, for two-and-a-half years in one matter and for six months in a second matter;â€¢ Failure to maintain current trust account records for approximately 40 clients in 2006 and 2007 by failing to maintain complete and accurate client ledgers, failing to maintain accurate check registers, failing to regularly reconcile his trust account bank statements with his check register and client ledgers, failing to withdraw fees from his trust account promptly as they were earned, and disbursing funds from his trust account for clients when there were insufficient funds on deposit for those clients or before the corresponding deposits for that client had been collected by the bank; andâ€¢ Mr. Zoro also admitted that there is a substantial likelihood the Association could prove, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, that he intentionally misrepresented to a Bar Association auditor, in connection with a disciplinary matter, the source and circumstances of a payment deposited in his trust account by submitting a fabricated deposit record to the auditor, in violation of RCW 9A.60.020.Mr. Zoroâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.14(b)(3) and current RPC 1.15A(h)(2), requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his or her client regarding them; current RPC 1.15A(c)(2), requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients and third persons separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property and to identify, label, and appropriately safeguard any property of clients or third persons other than funds; current RPC 1.15A(h)(1), prohibiting a lawyer from depositing funds belonging to the lawyer in a trust account; current RPC 1.15A(h)(6), requiring that trust records be reconciled as often as bank statements are generated or at least quarterly; current RPC 1.15A(h)(7), prohibiting a lawyer from disbursing funds from a trust account until deposits have cleared the banking process and have been collected, unless the lawyer and the bank have a written agreement by which the lawyer personally guarantees all disbursements from the account without recourse to the trust account; current RPC 1.15A(h)(8), prohibiting disbursements on behalf of a client or third person from exceeding the funds of that person on deposit and prohibiting funds of a client or third person to be used on behalf of anyone else; current RPC 1.15B(a)(1) and (8), requiring that a lawyer maintain current trust account records and including a checkbook register or equivalent for each trust account and copies of all trust account client ledger reconciliations; RPC 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; and RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit and misrepresentation.Natalea Skvir represented the Bar Association.

97.html,20337,Brad Plumb,,Disbarment,3/27/2000,,"Brad A. Plumb (WSBA No. 20337, admitted 1991), of Spokane, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective March 27, 2000, following a hearing. The discipline is based on providing false, misleading and fraudulent information to the Employment Security Department (ESD) to obtain unemployment benefits, and making misleading statements to the court.Matter 1: In February 1991, the City of Spokane Public Defenderâ€™s Office hired Mr. Plumb as a lawyer. In November 1991, the Public Defenderâ€™s Office terminated Mr. Plumbâ€™s employment for violating an office policy prohibiting representing private clients. In the same month, Mr. Plumb applied for unemployment benefits, stating that his supervisor gave no reason for terminating his employment. Mr. Plumb also told the ESD that he did not violate a company rule and that there was no final incident or reason for terminating his employment. Mr. Plumb told the ESD that he was self-employed on a commission basis. Mr. Plumb began receiving unemployment benefits the week ending November 16, 1991. On November 19, 1991, the City of Spokane protested Mr. Plumbâ€™s benefits, claiming he was ineligible because he was engaged in private practice. Mr. Plumb told the ESD that he did pro bono work only and did not receive compensation. On May 5, 1992, the ESD reinstated Mr. Plumbâ€™s benefits, based on his statements to them. Mr. Plumb received unemployment benefits until November 1992.In June 1992, Mr. Plumb met with an ESD adjudicator. Mr. Plumb did not mention his self-employment. Between October 11, 1991 and November 4, 1991, $10,400 was deposited into Mr. Plumbâ€™s IOLTA account. Between November 5, 1991 and December 21, 1992, $50,294 was deposited into another bank account in Mr. Plumbâ€™s name. Mr. Plumb also had a TFB account, which stood for The Family Business Account. Between August 11, 1992 and December 8, 1992, $7,408.65 was deposited into this account. The hearing officer found that the source of these deposits was legal fees and that this income was not reported to ESD. The hearing officer also found that Mr. Plumbâ€™s statements that he performed pro bono work only and earned no income were false and misleading. On June 4, 1992, Mr. Plumb opened an IOLTA account at a different bank. Between June 4, 1992 and February 25, 1993, $92,217.72 was deposited into this account. The hearing officer found that the deposits made between June 1992 and November 1992, the time Mr. Plumb was receiving benefits, were not reported to the ESD. The officer found that the non-reporting constituted fraud. Mr. Plumb also opened a business for his law practice on June 4, 1992. Between June 4, 1992 and March 19, 1993, $90,019.25 was deposited into this account. The hearing officer found that the deposits made into this account were not reported to the ESD, and constituted fraud. Mr. Plumb had two other accounts into which approximately $42,000 was deposited between February and May 1992. None of these deposits was reported to the ESD. Additionally, an employee of Plumb and Associates filed a tax report indicating $5,280 in income for the third quarter of 1992. Mr. Plumb did not report to the ESD that he had a full-time employee.On January 16, 1992, Mr. Plumb ordered a yellow pages tab ad for Brad Plumb, attorney at law, to run August 1992 through August 1993. On the application for credit, Mr. Plumb indicated that he paid $3,000 per month rent. Mr. Plumb filed suit when he was denied credit for the cost of his ad. On March 9, 1992, Mr. Plumb filed an affidavit in the lawsuit stating that the tab would be used to advertise his new law firm, and that if that did not work out, it would be used to advertise his solo practice. His affidavit also indicated that he had turned down several business opportunities, and had acquired a building, a new practice, bank accounts, phones, business cards and letterhead. Mr. Plumb did not disclose any of this information to the ESD. In September 1992, Mr. Plumb applied for a job at Spokane Community College. His application stated that he owned and managed a three-lawyer firm and worked 70 hours per week.In December 1994, January 1995 and March 1995, Mr. Plumb had a hearing before the Employment Security Department Office of Administrative Hearings. The administrative law judge found by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that Mr. Plumb was not eligible for benefits, and had willfully and intentionally withheld information from the ESD necessary to determine his eligibility. Mr. Plumb was ordered to repay $9,600. The hearing officer found that Mr. Plumb was self-employed and earning income as a lawyer during the time he received unemployment benefits. Mr. Plumbâ€™s failure to report his self-employment status was a misrepresentation of fact.Matter 2: On May 27, 1993, Mr. Plumb appeared at a sentencing hearing in Spokane Superior Court. The judge continued the hearing until Friday morning and asked Mr. Plumb if he was available. Mr. Plumb told the judge that he was participating in a golf tournament on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and would not be available. The golf tournament was only on Saturday and Sunday. Mr. Plumb wanted to participate in a ""skins"" golf game on Friday. This was not part of the tournament.Mr. Plumbâ€™s conduct violated RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; RPC 8.4 (b), prohibiting committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; RLD 1.1(a), prohibiting acts involving moral turpitude and acts reflecting disregard for the rule of law; RPC 3.3 (a)(1), prohibiting knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; RLD 1.1(c), the requirement in the Oath of Attorney that a lawyer maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers; and RLD 1.1(p), prohibiting conduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law.Marsha Matsumoto and Linda Eide represented the Bar Association.

Morgan (WSBA No. 22181, admitted 1992), of Olympia, was suspended for nine months, effective November 10, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline was based on conduct involving a conflict of interest.In fall of 2001, Mr. Morgan was hired by a client (Ms. Y) to represent her in her dissolution. Mr. Morgan filed the dissolution petition on December 12, 2001. Mr. Morgan and Ms. Y developed an attraction to one another and eventually entered into an inappropriate intimate relationship. There are conflicting accounts as to whether this relationship commenced in January or February 2002. On January 28, 2002, Mr. Morgan filed a notice of withdrawal and substitution in Ms. Yâ€™s case, substituting an associate at his law firm as attorney of record. Mr. Morgan did not tell this associate about his inappropriate intimate relationship with Ms. Y. According to the associate, she regularly asked Mr. Morgan for advice on Ms. Yâ€™s case. Mr. Morgan denies this.In May 2002, Ms. Yâ€™s husband confronted Ms. Y about the nature of her relationship with Mr. Morgan, and became increasingly hostile to her. In late July or early August 2002, Mr. Morganâ€™s associate asked Mr. Morgan to help negotiate a settlement of Ms. Yâ€™s case with opposing counsel. Mr. Morgan agreed and became actively involved in settlement negotiations. He finalized the financial aspects of the settlement. Prior to his re-entry into the case to negotiate the settlement, Mr. Morgan did not advise Ms. Y of any potential conflicts of interest or the risks of his representing her in light of their inappropriate intimate relationship, and did not have her sign a written waiver. The settlement was completed in August 2002 and the dissolution became final the next month. Mr. Morgan and Ms. Yâ€™s relationship ended several months later. In 2004, when Ms. Y was having difficulty living with the financial settlement, she sought counsel from other lawyers and subsequently brought a malpractice action against Mr. Morgan, his associate, and his law firm, which settled. Ms. Y filed a grievance with the Association after the settlement of the malpractice case.Mr. Morganâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.7(b), prohibiting a lawyer from representing a client if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests, unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client consents in writing after full disclosure.Joanne S.

973.html,12294,Stephen Blanchard,,Disbarment,7/23/2008,,"Stephen B. Blanchard (WSBA No. 12294, admitted 1982), of Edmonds, was disbarred, effective July 23, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following a default hearing. This discipline is based on conduct in two matters involving failure to provide competent representation, lack of diligence, failure to communicate, charging unreasonable fees, trust account irregularities, withholding client funds, and violations of duties in connection with disciplinary matters.Matter No. 1: In May 2000, a client hired Mr. Blanchard and paid him $1,300 to make a claim against the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR), which had cut down trees on her property without her permission. During 2001, the client telephoned Mr. Blanchard repeatedly concerning her claim, but he took no action. In March 2002, Mr. Blanchard filed a standard tort claim form with the Office of Risk Management on behalf of his client. Although the claim form clearly stated â€œClaimant must sign this claim form,â€ Mr. Blanchard did not inform the client, but instead signed it himself as her attorney. After the claim form was filed, the client called Mr. Blanchard repeatedly over a period of months asking him to file suit against the DNR before the statute of limitations expired. Mr. Blanchard filed suit in October 2003, five months after the statute of limitations had run out. The DNR moved for summary judgment based on the expiration of the statute of limitations and the fact that the client had not signed the claim form; the court entered summary judgment against the client on both grounds. Mr. Blanchard told the client that summary judgment was granted because she had not signed the claim form, without informing her that summary judgment had been entered in part because the statute of limitations had run out. Mr. Blanchard filed a notice of appeal from the summary judgment in March 2004. After filing the appeal, the Appeals Court warned him on several occasions that sanctions could be imposed because he failed to comply with the Rules of Appellate Procedure. The Appeals Court eventually dismissed the appeal due to Mr. Blanchardâ€™s failure to file an appellate brief and imposed $250 in sanctions against him. Mr. Blanchard later admitted that he had been negligent in pursuing the clientâ€™s claim. The client brought a malpractice claim against Mr. Blanchard and was awarded a monetary judgment against him, which he has not paid. Matter No. 2: In December 2004, a client hired Mr. Blanchard to probate the estate of her brother, who had just died intestate. The client, who lived out of state, paid Mr. Blanchard an advance fee of $750 and $120 for a court filing fee. He deposited the entire amount into his general account. At the time of his death, the decedentâ€™s assets consisted primarily of a Jeep and a retirement account. A car dealer offered to buy the Jeep for $2,050 on or before December 31, 2004, if the client or someone else obtained authority to sell it. The client placed the Jeep in a storage facility while awaiting legal authority. The client told Mr. Blanchard that she wanted to be appointed personal representative of her brotherâ€™s estate so that she could sell his Jeep and also obtain any mail the post office was holding for him. She also asked Mr. Blanchard to ascertain the status of the retirement account and the identity of any of its beneficiaries. The client returned to her home several days after hiring Mr. Blanchard and thereafter communicated with him by telephone and letter. He often failed to respond. On more than one occasion, the client requested an accounting of the money she had paid Mr. Blanchard, but he never provided one. Mr. Blanchard did not file a petition to probate the estate, did not communicate to the client why he failed to file the petition, and did not refund the money the client had paid him. Because no one was appointed personal representative of the estate, the offer to sell the Jeep expired, the storage facility took possession of it and the value did not rebound to the estate, and the post office would not release the decedentâ€™s mail to the client and instead returned it to the senders. A Michigan lawyer, on behalf of the client, wrote to Mr. Blanchard in March 2005 demanding copies of the decedentâ€™s death certificate, the keys to the Jeep, and return of the money the client had paid. Mr. Blanchard did not comply with the requests, but contacted the client and assured her that he would perform the tasks for which she had hired him. Mr. Blanchard took no steps to ascertain the status of the decedentâ€™s retirement account until he received the March letter from the Michigan lawyer. In May 2005, the Michigan lawyer again wrote to Mr. Blanchard, noting that Mr. Blanchard had not complied with the earlier request. He asked Mr. Blanchard to return the clientâ€™s file and the fees paid, and stated that he would advise the client to file a grievance with the Bar Association. Mr. Blanchard did not answer the second letter. His paralegal mailed to the client the Jeepâ€™s keys and several death certificates and stated that Mr. Blanchard would provide a billing statement, which he did not do. In February 2006, the clients in the two preceding matters filed grievances against Mr. Blanchard. He did not respond to the grievances or to subsequent certified letters from the Bar Association. Mr. Blanchard appeared for a deposition in April 2006 pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum, but failed to bring all of the documents listed in the subpoena. He did not produce any records relating to the money the client in the first matter paid him for his representation. He did produce billing statements for his representation of the client in the second matter; however, the bills included charges for work that was not performed by Mr. Blanchard.Mr. Blanchardâ€™s conduct violated RPC 1.1, requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client; RPC 1.2(a), requiring lawyers to abide by the clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of the representation; RPC 1.2(c), allowing a lawyer to limit the scope of representation if the limitation is reasonable under circumstances and the client consents after consultation; RPC 1.3, requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; former RPC 1.4, requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation; former RPC 1.5(a), requiring attorneysâ€™ fees to be reasonable; former RPC 1.14(a), requiring all funds of clients paid to a lawyer to be deposited in an interest-bearing trust account; RPC 1.14(b), requiring a lawyer to promptly notify a client of the receipt of his or her funds, maintain complete records of the funds, and promptly pay or deliver to the client the funds in the possession of the lawyer to which the client is entitled to receive; RPC 3.2, requiring a lawyer to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client; RPC 8.4(c), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and RPC 8.4(l), prohibiting a lawyer from violating a duty or sanction imposed by or under the Rules of Enforcement for Lawyer Conduct in connection with a disciplinary matter.Natalea Skvir represented the Bar Association.

977.html,11356,Mark Stansfield,,Reprimand,7/17/2008,,"Mark Stansfield (WSBA No. 11356, admitted 1980), of Quincy, was ordered to receive two reprimands on July 17, 2008, by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following an appeal. This discipline was based on conduct involving purporting to represent a personâ€™s estate without authorization and conflicts of interest. For more information, see In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Stansfield, 164 Wn.2d 108, 187 P.3d 254 (2008).In May 2003, a two-car accident in Quincy resulted in the death of three people. The police report stated that there was probable cause to believe that the collision was due to the driver of one of the vehicles (Mr. V) operating his Lexus â€œwhile under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug.â€ Mr. V was uninsured. In May 2003, the widow of the driver of the other vehicle (Mrs. U) and her daughter hired Mr. Stansfield to file an insurance claim on her husbandâ€™s behalf and to probate his estate. Mrs. U also asked Mr. Stansfield about suing Mr. V for wrongful death of her husband, which Mr. Stansfield counseled her against because Mr. V lacked assets. Around the same time, Mrs. U informed Mr. Stansfield that the widow of the passenger in her husbandâ€™s car (Mrs. C) lived in Guatemala and had given her authority to act as personal representative for Mr. Câ€™s estate. Mr. Stansfield had Mrs. U sign a retainer agreement and other documents as personal representative of Mr. Câ€™s estate. He then notified Mr. Uâ€™s insurance company that he represented the estates of both Mr. U and Mr. C and requested that they communicate directly with him. Mr. Stansfield wrote two letters to Mrs. C, translated into Spanish, asking whether she wanted him to handle her husbandâ€™s estate. He received no response. In fact, Mrs. C had authorized a relative who lived in Washington to hire another lawyer (Lawyer B) to represent their family. When Lawyer B contacted the insurance company, he was told that Mr. Stansfield claimed to represent Mr. Câ€™s family. He wrote to Mr. Stansfield and requested that he cease his representation. Mr. Stansfield promptly filed an attorneyâ€™s lien for $2,299.32 against Mr. Câ€™s estate, which delayed the familyâ€™s receipt of the insurance funds. Mr. Stansfield sent a formal notice of vacation of his lien in November 2005.In September 2003, approximately two weeks after Mr. Stansfield concluded matters regarding the insurance claim and estate probate for Mrs. U, Mr. Stansfield agreed to represent Mr. V, who was charged with three counts of vehicular homicide and two counts of vehicular assault from the motor vehicle collision. Although the two representations were substantially related and the two clients had materially adverse interests, Mr. Stansfield neither informed Mrs. U of his representation of Mr. V nor obtained her consent thereto. On September 22, 2003, before the arraignment, Mr. Stansfield had Mr. V sign a fee agreement and received a $10,000 nonrefundable flat fee. Mr. Stansfield represented Mr. V at his arraignment, where Mr. V pleaded not guilty. On the same day, Mr. Stansfield filed a notice of appearance, a notice of demand for discovery, a demand for preservation of evidence, a demand for jury trial, and a demand for a bill of particulars on behalf of Mr. V. Mrs. U attended the arraignment and was shocked and extremely upset to see Mr. Stansfield representing Mr. V. After the arraignment, Mrs. U expressed her concerns to the prosecutor. Mr. Stansfield decided to withdraw from the case and transferred all but $250 of the $10,000 to substitute counsel.Mr. Stansfieldâ€™s conduct violated former RPC 1.2(f), prohibiting a lawyer from willfully purporting to act as a lawyer for any person without the authority of that person; and former RPC 1.9(a), prohibiting a lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter from representing another client in the same or a substantially related matter in which that personâ€™s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client consents after consultation and a full disclosure of the material facts.Natalea Skvir represented the Bar Association.

98.html,20455,Donovan Bigelow,,Disbarment,12/7/1999,,"Donovan R. Bigelow (WSBA No. 20455, admitted 1986), of Seattle, has been disbarred by order of the Supreme Court effective December 7, 1999, following a stipulation approved by the Disciplinary Board on September 17, 1999. The discipline is based upon his unlawful attempt to induce a witness in an official proceeding to fail to attend the hearing.Mr. Bigelow represented the criminal defendant in a rape of a child in the third-degree charge. Mr. Bigelow spoke with the victimâ€™s mother by telephone on at least four occasions. During the first conversation, Mr. Bigelow told the mother that the prosecutorâ€™s case would not be successful without her sonâ€™s testimony. He also told her that if the client did not go to jail, the client would be in a position to compensate the child for what the client did. He told the mother that the Prosecutorâ€™s Office would threaten to arrest the mother and son if they did not show up for court, but that nothing would really happen.During the next phone call, Mr. Bigelow told the victimâ€™s mother they should meet in person to discuss her sonâ€™s attendance at the Art Institute of Seattle. The mother stated that she met with Mr. Bigelow and they discussed the client paying for the victimâ€™s schooling and counseling, and what would happen if the victim and the mother did not testify against the client. Although the prosecutor had not notified Mr. Bigelow of the date of the defense interview with the victim, Mr. Bigelow appeared on time the next day. During this interview, the victimâ€™s mother told the prosecutor and Mr. Bigelow that she did not want to cooperate and that the lawyers should settle the case.Mr. Bigelow left a phone message for the mother two days prior to the trial date, stating that he desperately needed to talk to her. At this point, the court authorized recording of any telephone conversations between the mother and Mr. Bigelow. When the mother returned the call, Mr. Bigelow referred to earlier conversations and his clientâ€™s willingness to compensate the mother and her son. He also stated that if the mother and son testified as expected, the client would surely end up in prison and a civil suit would not be successful. Mr. Bigelow asked whether the witnesses would be appearing in court. When the mother said no, Mr. Bigelow told her he would let her know whether the prosecutor sought a warrant for their arrest. As a result of his actions, Mr. Bigelow pleaded guilty to Attempted Tampering with a Witness in violation of RCW 9A.72.120(1)(b), a gross misdemeanor.

99.html,20482,Connie Arenberg,,Disbarment,3/30/2001,,"Connie R. Arenberg, also known as Connie Fernandez (WSBA No. 20482, admitted 1991), of Chicago, Illinois, was disbarred effective March 30, 2001, by order of the Supreme Court. The discipline is based upon her September 25, 2000 disbarment in the state of Illinois, on findings that she engaged in 96 acts of misconduct in violation of 13 disciplinary rules, affecting 23 clients over a three-year period. The violations included converting thousands of dollars and neglecting her clientsâ€™ cases.Matter 1: During 1994 through 1997, Ms. Arenberg agreed to represent eight clients in actions to recover their rental security deposits. Ms. Arenberg settled the cases and deposited the clientsâ€™ settlement funds into her trust account. Ms. Arenberg did not inform the clients that she received the funds, or deliver the funds to the clients. By May 22, 1997, Ms. Arenbergâ€™s client trust account balance was $2.48.Matter 2: In 1994, Ms. Arenberg represented the renter in a forcible entry and detainer action to collect unpaid rent. On January 31, 1995, the Circuit Court of Cook County granted summary judgment against Ms. Arenbergâ€™s client in the amount of $1,777.50. On March 2, 1995, Ms. Arenberg filed a notice of appeal from the judgment. At a hearing on March 13, the client appeared pro se and stated that Ms. Arenberg had filed the notice of appeal without his permission. The court continued the hearing because Ms. Arenberg was not present. On April 24, the parties filed settlement documents, and the client began making payments on the judgment.Matter 3: In March 1994, Ms. Arenberg agreed to represent the defendant in a complaint for forcible entry and detainer, and collection of past-due rent. In November 1995, the court entered a $26,775 judgment in favor of Ms. Arenbergâ€™s client. The judgment stated that the award of attorneyâ€™s fees was continued for presentation of an attorneyâ€™s-fees petition. Ms. Arenberg did not file a fee petition or take any further action to collect the judgment.Matter 4: In June 1994, Ms. Arenberg agreed to represent the defendant in a forcible detainer and collection of unpaid rent case. In October 1995, the court entered a judgment for Ms. Arenbergâ€™s client. The courtâ€™s order allowed 14 days for an attorneyâ€™s-fee petition to be filed and a date set for the fee hearing. Ms. Arenberg did not appear for the hearing and the case was stricken from the docket. As of December 1998, Ms. Arenberg had taken no further action on the case.Matter 5: On October 6, 1995, Ms. Arenberg filed a motion to vacate a summary judgment entered against her client. She failed to appear in court on the date set and the court struck the motion. On October 25, 1995, Ms. Arenberg filed a motion to vacate the order striking her prior motion. Ms. Arenberg did not inform the client of the judgment against him. The client discovered the judgment and directed Ms. Arenberg to negotiate a payment plan. The client specifically stated that he did not want to appeal the decision.On November 2, 1995, Ms. Arenberg filed a notice of appeal and deposited with the clerk a $5,000 check drawn on her client trust account. On November 8, Ms. Arenbergâ€™s check was returned for insufficient funds. In July 1996, the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Ms. Arenberg told the clerkâ€™s office that she would replace the check, but she did not.On November 18, 1996, the parties informed the judge that the matter had been settled and that the appeal should be dismissed. The clients agreed on a payment plan, and the client gave Ms. Arenberg his personal check payable to the plaintiff. In early November 1995, Ms. Arenberg had requested that her client give her two monthsâ€™ rent to hold in escrow pending the outcome of the appeal. The client gave Ms. Arenberg $560, which she deposited into her trust account. Ms. Arenberg did not pay rent with these funds, but on November 12, 1996, the clientâ€™s balance was $24.29. Ms. Arenberg used these funds for her own purposes.Ms. Arenberg prepared the order dismissing the appeal and specified that the $5,000 bond be returned to her, knowing she had not paid the appeal bond. The judge signed the order, and on November 22, 1996, Ms. Arenberg received and deposited a $5,118.09 check from the clerk.Matter 6: In January 1996, Ms. Arenberg agreed to represent a client in an action to recover her security deposit. On December 6, 1996, Ms. Arenberg filed a motion for an order of default. Between September 6, 1996 and December 19, 1996, the client informed Ms. Arenberg several times, both orally and in writing, that Ms. Arenberg was no longer the clientâ€™s lawyer. Ms. Arenberg did not withdraw or return the clientâ€™s file to her. The court denied the motion for order of default. Ms. Arenberg did not advise her client of this order.Additionally, Ms. Arenberg failed to cooperate with the investigation of the Illinois discipline matters and gave false testimony during the proceedings.Ms. Arenbergâ€™s conduct violated Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1(a), 1.2(a), 1.2(f)(1), 1.3, 1.4(a), 1.4(b), 1.15(b), 1.16(a) (4), 116(d), 3.2, 8.1(a)(2), 8.4(a)(5) and Illinois Supreme Court Rule 771.Felice Congalton represented the Bar Association.
