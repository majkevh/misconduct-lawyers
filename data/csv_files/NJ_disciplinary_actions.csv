Shortly after she was retained, respondent was suspended from the practice of law, but did not advise her client. In a second case, the respondent accepted a $200 retention for a bankruptcy matter just days before her suspension became effective. She accepted another $500 after she began serving the suspension and misrepresented to the client that she could not work on her case because of a broken toe. In the final matter, the respondent failed to appear at a bankruptcy court hearing, causing dismissal of the petition. Respondent then abandoned her client and also failed to obey the bankruptcy court order for a refund of the client’s retainer. She also converted $1,000 in bankruptcy funds to her own use. In its unreported decision, the Disciplinary Review Board concluded that “This respondent’s conduct has demonstrated that her professional character and fitness have been permanently and irretrievably lost. We, therefore, unanimously recommend that she be disbarred.” The respondent had an extensive disciplinary history. In 1988, she was privately reprimanded for gross neglect in a contract matter, and failure to communicate with the client for approximately 18 months. In 1992, she received another private reprimand for failure to file an answer on her client’s behalf, resulting in a default judgment against the client. In 1999, she was temporarily suspended for failure to comply with a fee arbitration award and to satisfy a monetary sanction. In re Annenko, 158 N.J. 184. The respondent was reinstated in July of 1999.

Ambrosio for respondent The Supreme Court of New Jersey held that a reprimand was the appropriate discipline for an attorney who represented a client in an automobile injury action. The attorney and the client both signed a document granting the client’s treating chiropractor a $6,763 lien against the recovery.

Despite several inquiries by the treating chiropractor, the respondent paid only part of the $6,763 due. The Court found that the respondent failed to promptly deliver funds to a third person and also that he failed to cooperate with disciplinary authorities during the investigation and processing of the matter. The respondent was previously disciplined. In 1995, he was admonished for gross neglect, failure to communicate with a client, failure to withdraw as counsel, failure to promptly turn over his client’s file to a new attorney, and failure to reply to requests for information from a disciplinary authority.

As the Disciplinary Review Board also stated in its unreported decision: “In addition, her behavior at the ethics hearing was abominable. She continually interrupted the presenter and other witnesses, accused her adversary of withholding discovery (despite four prehearing conferences in which discovery was either exchanged or discussed) and repeatedly referred to matters that were irrelevant to the ethics proceeding… Respondent’s improper behavior and pattern of misrepresentation continued during her presentation to us. In her brief, although she did not file a motion to supplement the record, she repeatedly referred to matters outside of the record. At oral argument, she continued to refer to matters outside the record, even after she was instructed not to do so, in an effort to mislead us about the facts of the case.” The respondent has a disciplinary history. In 1998, she was suspended for three months, effective March 24, 1998, for various misconduct in four matters, including gross neglect, lack of diligence, failure to communicate with clients, failure to communicate the basis of the fee, failure to turn over the client’s file upon termination of representation, false statement of material fact to a tribunal, failure to cooperate with disciplinary authorities, conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation, and false statements of material fact to disciplinary authorities.

Geller appeared pro se The Supreme Court of New Jersey held that a reprimand was the appropriate discipline for an attorney who engaged in numerous instances of unethical conduct, including discrimination arising out of his representation of himself in a divorce/custody litigation. The unreported Disciplinary Review Board decision concluded that the respondent violated ethics rules against discrimination and ethnic bias when, referring to one of the judge’s rulings in the case, he remarked that “Monmouth County Irish have their own way of doing business.” The respondent also engaged in bias and invective by alleging in various pleadings at the trial and appellate level that one of the judges handling his case favored his wife “because she was from Monmouth County and Catholic, while respondent was from Essex County and Jewish.” He also referred to one of the judges as having “used this Jewish angle” and in motion papers rhetorically asked “What chance does a Jew from Essex County have in Monmouth County?” His allegations of bias against the judges were without factual foundation. The respondent also failed to treat others with courtesy and consideration during the litigation and made personal attacks against almost everyone involved in the matter, including two judges, his adversary and former girlfriend and her attorney, an unrelated litigant, and the court-appointed custody evaluator. The Disciplinary Review Board noted that the respondent’s conduct during his deposition was “nothing short of appalling.

Kingsbery, III for Attorney Ethics Alan Dexter Bowman for Respondent The Supreme Court of New Jersey held that disbarment was the appropriate discipline for an attorney who was the subject of four separate recommendations for discipline recommending a one-year suspension, a three-year suspension, and two separate recommendations for disbarment. The Board’s decision covered 19 separate findings of unethical conduct. The first Board decision was issued on September 30, 1997. The misconduct included multiple violations of gross neglect, lack of diligence, failure to keep a client reasonably informed and failure to respond to reasonable requests for information, charging an unreasonable fee, failing to communicate the basis or rate of fee to a client, failure to cooperate with disciplinary authorities and conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. The respondent had been temporarily suspended from the practice of law since July 1, 1998. The respondent had an extensive disciplinary history. In 1990, he was suspended for six months for grossly neglecting seven cases, negotiating settlements without the clients’ authorization, advancing money to clients for personal expenses and displaying a gun during meetings with clients. In re Martin, 118 N.J. 239. He was suspended for three months in 1991 for failure to return an unearned portion of a retainer after the case was dismissed, failure to pursue an appeal, failure to adequately communicate with clients in three matters, and failure to reply to requests for information by a district ethics committee investigator. That suspension was to run consecutively to the suspension imposed in 1990. In re Martin, 122 N.J. 198. In 1993, the respondent was publicly reprimanded for unethical conduct in three matters, which involved violations of gross neglect, lack of diligence, lack of communication, and conduct involving misrepresentation. In re Martin, 132 N.J. 261. In 1998, the respondent consented to being temporarily suspended from the practice of law, pending the final determination of all grievances against him. As a result, the Disciplinary Review Board issued four separate recommendations for discipline, which were heard together before the Supreme Court in 2003. During the course of the Court’s receipt of the Board’s four decisions, the respondent filed a motion with the Supreme Court to supplement the record. In 1999, the Court directed that the matters, including the motion to supplement the record, be remanded to a special ethics master. After extensive hearings, the special master recommended to the Supreme Court that respondent be disbarred. In its final recommendation for disbarment in 2000, the Disciplinary Review Board summed up respondent’s transgressions in the four matters it considered since 1997 as follows: Respondent has shown, in thirty-five separate cases, that he is unable—or unwilling--to competently represent clients. Furthermore, respondent has shown that he has little regard for the attorney disciplinary system. He has either completely ignored ethics complaints and allowed defaults to be entered against him, or he has attempted to file answers to the complaints after the defaults have already been transmitted to us—despite prior timely notice of the complaints.",1973

Respondent’s violations included numerous statements in front of the jury that the judge was unfair and prejudiced, announcing the time more than 130 times during a jury trial, which conduct was disruptive, and his failure to expedite litigation. As the Disciplinary Review Board noted in its unreported opinion: As an experienced practitioner, he knew better than to comport himself the way he did before these judges. As to respondent’s claims that the judges were biased against his clients, the proper forum for that argument is the appellate tribunal or a judicial review board. Further, respondent’s conduct was not an aberrational outburst, but a continued course of conduct throughout the proceedings.

In fashioning the discipline imposed in this case, the Court gave credence to respondent’s mitigation that she had severe emotional problems during the time in question and that she did make attempts to close her practice down and distribute client files.

In addition to grossly neglecting the client’s matter, respondent failed to cooperate with disciplinary authorities during the investigation and processing of the case.

Richter for Attorney Ethics Respondent failed to appear The Supreme Court of New Jersey held that a suspension from the practice of law for a period of one year was the appropriate discipline for corporate counsel for Warner- Lambert, who essentially bribed two attorneys not to pursue future claims against the drug company in exchange for the payment of $225,000. Mr. Zaruba’s offering of the agreement placed defense counsel in a conflict of interest situation with their own clients, because the agreement contained a confidentiality clause, that prohibited the attorneys from disclosing the full terms of the settlement to their clients. Those terms included an agreement not to sue or otherwise assert any claims on behalf of any parties against Warner-Lambert relating to the product in question and that the $225,000 payment was for reasonable fees and expenses for the litigation, with the clients receiving only a full, money-back guarantee for the defective product. The attorneys told their clients that they were abandoning claims against Warner-Lambert because they had not obtained a sufficient number of consumers willing to join the class action. The agreements here violated RPC 5.6(b) by making an agreement in which a restriction on a lawyer’s right to practice is part of the settlement; and 8.4(a) by inducing or assisting others to violate the RPC’s.

Finally, the respondent failed to cooperate with disciplinary authorities in a most egregious manner. As related in the decision of the Disciplinary Review Board: ""One of the most troubling aspects of this case was respondents' failure to cooperate with disciplinary authorities. (T)hese respondents set about a scorched-earth strategy of intimidation, false accusations and intolerable disrespect for the hearing panel and its individual members and attempted to protract the proceedings, when it appeared that things were not going their way. Respondents are not newcomers to the disciplinary system. Each is well aware of the requirement of cooperation with ethics authorities in all phases of a disciplinary proceeding. Yet, from the inception of the DEC investigation, they ignored and/or misled the investigator, and later the panel, in a series of calculated maneuvers designed to thwart the investigation and to delay the hearing process. For all of the foregoing reasons, we had no difficulty finding that respondents deliberately set about to thwart the disciplinary process, in violation of RPC 8.1(b).""

In the attorney disciplinary proceeding, the Supreme Court majority found that the respondent violated RPC 1.2(e) when his client gave him a manila envelope to pass on to the municipal police commissioner for the client's son. On inspection, the respondent discovered that not only did the envelope include the son's resume, but also two blank envelopes together containing $10,000 in cash. The respondent did not immediately communicate with any law enforcement authorities, but rather met with the municipal police commissioner and posed to him a hypothetical question, essentially asking what he would do if someone gave him money and asked for a favor. Sometime thereafter, the respondent and the municipal police commissioner decided to report the matter to the acting police chief. This was ultimately accomplished by the municipal police commissioner, and not by respondent. The Court majority held that there was not clear and convincing evidence that the respondent actually participated in a bribery scheme.

Respondent repeatedly demonstrated both ignorance of the professional standards and guidelines applicable to all attorneys and an inability or refusal to become familiar with those standards and guidelines. Also, she continually displayed questionable judgment (such as obtaining and issuing a federal subpoena in state litigation and seeking to litigate an excluded issue, thereby exposing her client to liability), inadequate pretrial skills (such as failing to engage in discovery and failing to file necessary pleadings) and deplorable courtroom behavior, all of which were not attributable to her lack of experience.""

Ostrer for District VB Respondent did not appear The Supreme Court of New Jersey, on a certified record from and decision by the Disciplinary Review Board, held that a suspension from the practice of law for a period of one year was the appropriate discipline for a respondent who, jointly with her husband, David S. Brantley, accepted a divorce matter and then grossly neglected the case allowing it to be dismissed for failure to file a case information statement. The respondent also failed to return the unearned retainer fee of $3,580. She also failed to return the client's original papers and file on termination of the representation. Finally, the respondent failed to cooperate with disciplinary authorities in a most egregious manner. As related in the decision of the Disciplinary Review Board: ""One of the most troubling aspects of this case was respondents' failure to cooperate with disciplinary authorities. (T)hese respondents set about a scorched-earth strategy of intimidation, false accusations and intolerable disrespect for the hearing panel and its individual members and attempted to protract the proceedings, when it appeared that things were not going their way. Respondents are not newcomers to the disciplinary system. Each is well aware of the requirement of cooperation with ethics authorities in all phases of a disciplinary proceeding. Yet, from the inception of the DEC investigation, they ignored and/or misled the investigator, and later the panel, in a series of calculated maneuvers designed to thwart the investigation and to delay the hearing process. For all of the foregoing reasons, we had no difficulty finding that respondents deliberately set about to thwart the disciplinary process, in violation of RPC 8.1(b)."" The Supreme Court ordered that, since the respondent is currently suspended, the one-year suspension imposed by this order will not commence until the expiration of her current suspension that was originally ordered on March 9, 1999. The Court stated that the1999 suspension of three months will not start running until respondent complies with the Court's order to return an earned retainer in another matter and until respondent's temporary suspension from practice is lifted. The respondent has an extensive disciplinary history. In 1998, she was temporarily suspended for failure to comply with a Supreme Court Order directing her to return a $7,500 unearned retainer to a client. In that same year, the respondent was reprimanded for gross neglect, pattern of neglect, lack of diligence and failure to communicate with clients in three matters, failure to release the file to the client and failure to return an unearned fee in the amount of $7,500 in one of those matters. In 1999, she was again suspended, this time for three months, for gross neglect, pattern of neglect, lack of diligence, failure to communicate with the client, and failure to cooperate with disciplinary authorities. The temporary suspension from practice has never been lifted.",1980

Sweeney for Attorney Ethics Helen Davis Chaitman for respondent The Supreme Court of New Jersey held that disbarment was the appropriate discipline for an attorney who unethically conducted a private investigation of a judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, displayed contempt of court by failing to comply with Supreme Court Rules governing suspended attorneys, practiced law while suspended and failed to cooperate with the Office of Attorney Ethics during the investigation and processing of this matter. Additionally, the respondent was disbarred in the state of New York, for, among other things, willful disobedience of discovery orders, as well as for making false statements in affidavits. In that proceeding, the New York court noted that, during the past 11 years, the respondent was sanctioned, criticized or disciplined 38 times in various courts across the country for professional misconduct involving numerous clients. Thirty-six of the 38 instances in which respondent was sanctioned, criticized or disciplined, were summarized by Judge William Bassler of the United States District Court, District of New Jersey, in Kramer v. Tribe, 156 F.R.D. 96 (D.N.J. 1994), Aff'd 52 F.3d 315 (3d Cir. 1995), Cert. Denied 516 U.S. 907 (1995). With respect to the respondent's improper investigation of a federal judge, that matter was precipitated by the judge's overturning a jury award of $238 million in favor of respondent's client. Apparently, the respondent suspected that the judge had been improperly influenced in his actions and determined to conduct a private investigation of possible corruption. He hired a private investigator for this purpose. The agreement signed with the private investigator provided, among other things, that the investigator would receive a performance bonus of $250,000 ""out of the net settlement proceeds upon settlement of the matter with the adversary, provided that (the investigator) obtains corroborating evidence prior to any such settlement...."" During the course of that investigation, one of the investigator's associates illegally obtained the judge's personal American Express credit card records, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. §1030(a)(2)(A)(2), and he provided those records to the respondent. The Disciplinary Review Board in its unreported opinion came to the following conclusion: ""Respondent has willfully and repeatedly disregarded court rules, court orders and rules of professional conduct. He has willfully and repeatedly displayed egregious disrespect for the courts, his adversaries, the judicial process and the disciplinary system.... He is obviously incapable of or unwilling to conform to the requirements of the legal profession."" The respondent was previously disciplined. In 1993, he was reprimanded for gross neglect, lack of diligence, failure to withdraw as counsel when discharged, failure to protect the client's interests after termination of the representation, and failure to cooperate with disciplinary authorities. In re Kramer, 130 N.J. 536. In 1997, respondent was suspended for a period of six months for failing to abide by a client's decisions about the objectives of the representation in obtaining a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of the litigation.

He accepted retainers in matrimonial matters and then performed very little work. In most instances, he failed to tell his clients of his suspension. Even when he complied with Supreme Court rules to disclose his suspension, he nevertheless violated them by referring clients to another attorney. Further, the respondent flagrantly disregarded the prohibition against practicing law while suspended. He also made numerous misrepresentations to his clients to mislead them about the status of their matters, grossly neglected their cases, causing financial harm to several clients. Moreover, he knowingly misappropriated $2,000 in client trust funds. Respondent has a history of discipline.

Kingsbery, III for Attorney Ethics Thomas R. Ashley for respondent The Supreme Court of New Jersey held that disbarment was the appropriate discipline for an attorney who permitted a non-lawyer acquaintance, Gonzalo Camprubi-Soms (the director of an organization known as Solon Legal Foundation, which provided assistance to individuals being released from prison), unfettered access to her law office and to her clients' funds. Camprubi-Soms had pleaded guilty to real estate fraud and had been incarcerated, which facts were known to respondent. As a result, Camprubi-Soms stole approximately $66,000 from respondent's clients. Respondent's lack of supervision of Camprubi-Soms constituted willful blindness, particularly in the cases in which the thefts occurred after respondent had been warned about Camprubi-Soms. This amounted to knowing misappropriation. In addition, in one matter, the respondent, herself, knowingly misappropriated her clients' funds. The Disciplinary Review Board, in recommending disbarment to the Supreme Court, summarized the matter as follows: ""The unfortunate picture that emerges from this record is one in which respondent totally deserted her clients. She turned her law practice over to Soms, a non-attorney and convicted felon. Respondent failed to protect her clients or their funds from Soms' greedy grasp. It is obvious from respondent's testimony that she did not even perform such perfunctory tasks as looking at her clients' files or returning their telephone calls. Her record keeping was virtually non-existent. Respondent was content to allow Soms to run her law office. He answered her telephone, opened and sorted her mail, met with her clients, prepared correspondence, reviewed her trust account records and essentially functioned as her associate/paralegal office manager. Respondent exercised no supervision over Soms and placed no controls over his activities. She did not establish any procedure to monitor his actions. Although she knew that Soms had pleaded guilty to a felony charge of real estate fraud, she allowed him unrestricted access to her attorney bank accounts, thereby allowing him to steal her clients' funds.""

The Supreme Court noted that respondent's attempt to analogize attorney discipline cases to bar admissions cases, which give greater consideration to rehabilitation from past delinquencies,""is a frail one at best."" The Court stated that: ""The most obvious difference, and the one that most clearly justifies differential treatment of the two proceedings, is that at the time of his or her past delinquency, the bar applicant was not bound by the solemn oath taken by every attorney and by the strictures of our Rules of Professional Conduct, as every practicing lawyer is. The oath and those Rules cast a different light on otherwise identical misconduct because the attorney, unlike the applicant, acts in contravention of standards to which he or she has knowingly and affirmatively acceded.

At the request of respondent the Supreme Court stayed the effectiveness of its decision pending filing of a motion for reconsideration. That motion was denied and the stay vacated by order dated September 11, 1990, which became effective September 12, 1990. The respondent had been practicing under a restricted license since March 5, 1984 when the Supreme Court ordered that he ""be restrained from making disbursal of funds in the Business and Trust Accounts maintained by the law firm... pending final disposition of the ethics complaints against him.""",1967

Wood for Attorney Ethics John P. Morris for respondent The Supreme Court of New Jersey held that a suspension from the practice of law for three months was the appropriate discipline for a respondent who, in his own matrimonial matter, failed to inform the court of the fact that he had transferred real property for no consideration which he had previously certified to the court as an asset. That concealed conveyance, the court noted, was ""purported fraud, a seemingly dishonest act and plainly destructive of the sound and proper administration of justice."" Moreover, the Court held that respondent knowingly made a false certification when he ""failed to amend the certification of his assets to disclose the transfer"" because ""he imperiled the ability of the court to determine the truth and reach a just result."" In this regard he obviously failed in his duty of candor owed to the court. The Supreme Court cited as an aggravating factor respondent's prior discipline on December 2, 1986 of a private reprimand for his dual representation of a buyer and seller in the sale of a business without full disclosure to both parties of the potential conflict of interest inherent in such representations and the risks involved. The respondent was reinstated to the practice of law by order of the Supreme Court, effective September 25, 1990.",1981

Janasie for Attorney Ethics Respondent appeared pro se The Supreme Court of New Jersey held that disbarment was the appropriate discipline for an attorney who knowingly misappropriated almost $1,500 being held in his Attorney Trust Account in a divorce matter. These funds were used to cover respondent's personal expenses after the Internal Revenue Service levied upon the Attorney Business Account. While the respondent maintained that the entire amount of trust funds held was due to him as legal fees, on remand hearing before a district ethics committee hearing panel he was unable to offer any evidence in support of his claim of right. The Court therefore concluded that this theory was developed as ""an ad hoc justification for his actions."" Also in defense respondent had advanced his alcohol dependency at the time of the underlying events. While acknowledging this fact, as well as respondent's domestic and financial problems during this period, the Court concluded that: The evidence falls short of suggesting that when respondent used the trust funds for his personal expenditures, he was unable to comprehend the nature of his act or lacked the capacity to form the requisite intent. (Quoting In re Hein, 104 N.J. 297, 303 (1986)). The respondent was also found guilty of gross neglect and a pattern of neglect in six separate cases between 1978 and 1983 which included his failure to carry out contracts of employment as well as allowing the Statutes of Limitations to run on various client's claims.

Responding to a proffered drug defense to dispute the knowingness of the misappropriations which occurred, the Court addressed the question of ""whether he suffered such a loss of competency, comprehension, or will of such magnitude as would excuse conduct that was otherwise knowing or purposeful."" The Court found, however, that: (W)e have been unable to rationalize the qualitative differences that would excuse the violation in the case of one suffering disease or defeat, or one suffering from drugs or other dependency from one suffering the anguish of collapsing home life or marriage due to economic or other strains. Consequently, we have chosen to resolve the choice of professional discipline by maintaining our primary focus on the public interest.

Moreover, respondent misused $751.75 of purchasers deposit monies in violation of the statutory trust imposed upon developers by N.J.S.A. 2A:29A-1 to utilize deposit funds solely for advancement of the development in which residential lots are sold.

Janasie for Attorney Ethics Nancy Iris Oxfeld for respondent The Supreme Court of New Jersey held that a three – month suspension from the practice of law was the appropriate discipline for an attorney who, in a civil personal injury action, verbally threatened opposing counsel, challenged him to a fight, engaged in vulgar name-calling (including racial innuendo) of opposing counsel and his investigator and who used threatening, abusive and vulgar language directed to the trial judge's law clerk. In imposing discipline the Court cautioned that: There cannot be genuine respect of the adversary system without respect for the adversary, and disrespect for the adversary system bespeaks disrespect for the court and the proper administration of justice. Concerning respondent's use of racial innuendo in the trial setting, the Court found it to be particularly intolerable. Any kind of conduct of verbal oppression or intimidation that projects offensive and invidious discriminatory distinctions, be it based on race or color, as in this case, or, in other contexts, on gender, or ethnic or national background or handicap, is especially offensive. In the context of either the practice of law or the administration of justice, prejudice both to the standing of this profession and the administration of justice will be virtually conclusive if intimidation, abuse, harassment, or threats focus or dwell on invidious discriminatory distinctions. The respondent had been previously disciplined by suspension from practice for one year in 1983 for similar behavior, In re Vincenti, 92 N.J. 591 (1983).

Karcher for respondent The Supreme Court of New Jersey held that a suspension from the practice of law was the appropriate discipline for an attorney who (1) pled guilty in the United States District Court for New Jersey to one count of willfully failing to file an income tax return, (2) engaged in a pattern of neglect and gross neglect of 6 separate clients over a five year period between 1980 and 1984, (3) during this same time, engaged in a pattern of overreaching by charging unreasonable fees to clients in eight separate matters (4) knowingly issuing a check to a client drawn on insufficient funds in 1982, and (5) admittedly using illegal drugs (cocaine and marijuana). While noting that normally this variety of misconduct would justify a sugst5antial suspension, the Court held that the record in this case was clear that at the relevant period of respondent's misconduct he ""was in the throes of alcoholism"" from which he has now been recovering and abstinent since 1984. Consequently, since the respondent had ""gained control of his life,"" his alcoholism mitigated the punishment which would ordinarily be imposed. The Court concluded: That suspension is long enough, we believe, to remind the bar of its special obligation to file personal tax returns and to act ethically with respect to clients, yet not so long as to dissuade other alcoholic lawyers from seeking the help they need for their own good and that of their clients.

In determining that respondent must be disbarred the Court found two primary violations. In the first matter respondent attempted to use the power and prestige of his office as a Superior Court Judge to influence the disposition of pending municipal court charges against respondent's daughter and to deter other public officials from performing their lawful duties. In the second matter respondent conspired with others to acquire real property belonging to litigants in an ongoing matter before him. He also suborned perjury.

The attorney was also found to have overreached two clients by charging excessively high fees. The Court determined, however, that at the time of these events respondent's professional capacity was seriously and detrimentally affected by medial illness (Reiter's Syndrome) which was itself exacerbated by alcoholism. The Court specifically noted: We do not believe this condition would excuse dishonesty or misappropriation. Similarly, his alcoholism, standing alone, would not serve to mitigate any ethics breaches involving dishonesty or misappropriation. Such a condition, however, may serve to explain ethics breaches involving inadequate professional performance. While alcoholism as such will rarely excuse any ethics transgressions, the exacerbation of his physical disease by alcoholism can be relevant in assessing ethical guilt. [citations omitted.] Respondent has now rehabilitated himself from his alcoholism, which condition, together with Reiter's Syndrome, afford respondent mitigation in this disciplinary matter.

In response to respondent's contention that any misuse was attributable to ""sloppy record keeping practices,"" the Court noted that: (P)oor accounting procedures are no excuse for using clients' funds and poor record keeping cannot be used to camouflage attorney theft or misuse.

Concerning the overreaching charge the Court stated: (W)e have held that an attorney cannot deliberately design, fashion, or maintain a bookkeeping system in such a way as to confound determination of whether he has intentionally misused a client's accounts or intentionally overcharged a client. The Court held that, while normally conduct of this kind would require an extended period of suspension from practice, such as the two year period recommended by the Disciplinary Review Board, the extended delay in imposition of discipline in this case (the underlying conduct occurred almost fifteen years ago) coupled with respondent's unblemished record are substantial mitigation factors peculiar to this case, and thus a suspension of six months is the appropriate discipline.
